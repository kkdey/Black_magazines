the heritage of hitler
by s carter mcmorris
he most abominable aspect of the hitlernazi philosophy was the doctrine of aryanismnordicism hitler never one to mince words spelled it out in mein kampf in his advocacy of a world of stratification of the races with the aryans at the very top of a dominant white race with the yellow and black races assigned to positions in that order hitler and those of his ilk were sincere in their belief in this as well » as other phases of their way of life and had they won their war to make the world safe for nordicism we would have soon seen such stratification what the nazis were capable of in the way of racial improvement is demonstrated by their genocide of the jewish people it is shocking to think that in a supposedly scientific civilized world this attitude formed part of the way of life and thought of a system which came to an end only a brief sixteen years ago having been firmly propagandized into the minds of the whole nation during the nazi heyday it would be wishful thinking to suppose that such ideas have been eradicated nor of course were they original in their basic approach with hitler racism or the doctrine of inherent racial stratification has been a part of the philosophy of many individuals who have not hesitated to leave their heritage in literature and of nations which have not hesitated to impose this philosophy in action slavery was the supreme example of the latter nor is presentday racism confined to nazism at bottom the official philosophy of the southern states of this country is that negroes are inherently inferior and should be relegated to the place hitler had in store for them this fact is important for nonwhites american and otherwise for there must be a question as to what extent this southern attitude infects the american program as this nation offers itself as the leader of the western world  it is the opinion of this writer that all philosophies and beliefs should find full expression even racism with logic and science eventually pointing the way to that which is valid correct and lasting so i shall attempt to rely upon scientific reasoning and simple commonsense observation to refute the very present doctrine of racial superiorityinferiority those who believe in the stratification of the races point to the backwardness or more politely underdevelopedness of africa and argue that this is inherent while the caucasian they argue has reached a higher civilization because of inherent superiority there are many scientific answers in refutation in the first place there have been periods of history when other than white civilizations were dominant or more advanced secondly just a breath ago in the history of man europeans were in a state of advance about the equivalent of darkest africa today only about  years ago did the european adapt the chineseinvented gunpowder for use in war enabling them to conquer and enslave the nonwhites again there is not much question that the chinese and japanese people nonwhite are about as civilized and about as advanced technologically and economically as the european and north americans then too many countries today peopled by caucasians are classed as underdeveloped finally the development of the negro in a world which discriminates against him to a position of near educational and economic equality in america flics in the face of any attempt to explain social differences as inherently biological thus with all the odds and strikes against the american negro he has a highly respected professional class of doctors lawyers engineers teachers social workers etc many recognized leaders in their respective fields he has retail businesses banks insurance companies factories of his own the owners of some of which have reached the millionaire status although the racist argument of the south is that white children will be retarded by integration with the inferior negro in the northern schools where there has been virtually complete educational assimilation of the races much higher educational standards have been attained and maintained with negroes holding their own often excelling scholastically culturally musically athletically as for the african negro both climate and colonial exploitation have been against him and yet he has generally achieved political freedom today while there has been a concerted effort on the part of the colonialists to extend only to a privileged few of the exploited the benefits of education and culture the fact that those who have been exposed to it naturally without effort have taken on every aspect of western culture and civilization belies anything fundamental about the status in which recent history may have placed the african as for the political upheaval in the congo precedent has been set throughout modern history by the wars often civil revolutions even warring over the outcome of elections which was considered characteristic of latin nonnegro america at least until the latest times i would defend not to the death surely but to the highest courts the constitutional right of the racists to believe as they do believe and to express their beliefs more importantly i would assert their right to unemotionally objectively consider the evidence against their point of view for their problem is one of education the presentation of the best thought on the subject upon which their ignorance if not so overcome will be their destruction ignorance is not blissit is death 
im glad youre dead 
you  r you
by isikiah turner 
ie of the last remaining stalwarts of the american tradition has finally died may his old soul know eternal torment after living a long and ignoble life many no doubt will lament his passing these will say that his demise is untimely personally i will say just two words good riddance i am per fectly happy to take scriptural heed it says weep for those that are born rejoice for those that go to their reward it is said that one should not speak of the dead disparagingly i do not i speak with genuine sincerity im glad youre dead you rascal you in due respect to the departed let us make haste to bury him lest somehow the old scoundrel might be revived there are many who in all probability might contend that uncle tom was bom out of necessity that he was a way of survival be that as it may however as far as i am concerned he is dead and done and while we are burying uncle tom why not make it a double funeral let us bury the old negro image too it is time we realized that we are on the high road of a new day let us create a new image befitting our new roles we are black men we are no longer negroes we must have a spiritual and physical renaissance in our deportment on our jobs in the streets at work or at play we must carry ourselves with dignity we must know that with each degree of freedom or progress we shall make we must also take the same degree of responsibility these two arc twins they come hand in hand it is impossible to have the one without the other those of us who know our potential must feel duty bound to help a brother realize this i speak directly to that black man who by some stroke of fortune feels that he is better than his less fortunate black brother if we can not feel sincerely that we are our brothers keeper we are doomed to languish in that same chasm that others before us are trapped in neither an individual a community a nation nor a world can continue to enjoy so precious a thing as freedom while at the same time denying that freedom to others we must utilize our full capabilities in order to cope with our new duties we must throw away the crutch of selfpity that is something we can bury along with uncle tom we leaned on it much too long we must stop laughing when we are not amused we must stop scratching our bodies when we do not itch we must stop stammering when we know very well we do not have a speech impediment we must remember the fact that uncle tom is dead done and finished we black people of today we men and women of destiny we should ever be reminded that we owe the men and women of yesteryears our fathers and mothers a mighty debt a debt which can be repaid only in our taking full advantage of todays opportunities they dreamed of these days we are the media through which their dreams can become realities failure on our part to apply ourselves in every way possible means a betrayal of that trust and faith which they placed in us those heroic people paid a great and terrible price for todays advantages yes they paid for them in sweat tears labor blood and death we must not be traitors to these honored dead we know that our historical accomplishments have not been given their due recognition we feel that our contributions to our countrys greatness have been deliberately omitted from its history books may i at this time emphasize the fact to anyone who might question my loyalty this is my country make no mistake about that the blood of my fathers was poured into the mortar that holds together the bulwark of freedom which this nations foundation rests on that blood cries to me incessantly reminding me of my sacred duty to all black people who gave their lives to help to make this country great until the black man in this country is accorded full citizenship equality and justice under the law the cries of that blood shall not be quiescent by that same token i cannot have peace of mind therefore i now serve notice on all whom it may concern that until  get my just due my voice will become louder and louder indeed it shall become a mighty dirge reverberating throughout the length and breadth of this vast country if i may return to our history again we people of color cannot excuse ourselves for not knowing our history i feel that those of us who do not know of our past should apply ourselves assiduously to correct that situation there are quite a few books on the market today for that purpose find them study them and learn of the many men and women of color who strode across the pages of history and distinguished themselves so nobly we cannot tell others about the nat turners the harriet tubmans the sojourner truths the dunbars the douglasses the washingtons the bannekers the delanys the bruces the smalls to mention a few if we do not know of them ourselves study our folklore search the origins of our blues and spirituals our voodooism and our old sayings you shall be richly rewarded for in them you shall know that our heritage is a very fine one indeed this experience can be electrifying it can be your personal renaissance it can make you walk talk think and act with dignity i sincerely feel that this illumination will prompt you to join me in burying uncle tom and after the planting we will make merry in the streets with singing and dancing in the best tradition of new orleans jazz we will return to the hall marching to that swinging tune i am glad you are dead you rascal you

oung matthew henl  son was glad to be a  w stock boy in a washc ington d c hat   store the job didnt pay much but in  it was as much as an uneducated  year old negro could expect  matt called steinmetz one spring morning bring a size seven and threeeighths sun helmet henson hustled the hat to the front room there his employer and a customer looked at him speculatively this is the boy i was telling you about lieutenant steinmetz said the customer was a young naval officer tall and lean with cold blue eyes and a shaggy mustache he clapped the sun helmet on his head looked into the mirror and said to hensons reflection  i am lt peary and im going to nicaragua to survey a proposed ships canal between the atlantic and pacific i need a responsible boy to go with me as my personal servant its jungle country a nasty climate the work wont be easy mr steinmetz recommends you do you want the job henson thought a moment then said yes sir i think id like to have it this offhand interchange established a relationship that was to be unique for lt peary was to become adm robert e peary the relentless explorer of the arctic and discoverer of the north pole matthew henson was to be with him until  a  year journey author floyd miller tells the story of these years in an exciting new book ahdoolo a biography of matthew a henson the negro who accompanied peary to the north pole dutton henson was remarkably mature and capable for his age to impoverished sharecroppers in maryland he had been orphaned and left in the care of a kindly friend aunt jenny he washed dishes in her restaurant and slept in the kitchen at night she tried to send him to school but young matt dreamed of adventure when he was  he walked from washington to baltimore hoping to go to sea as a cabin boy a soft hearted captain took him on and for the next six years henson traveled the world aboard the merchantman katie hines the ships officers taught him first to read and write then the skills of an able seaman he learned to play the concertina and developed a good singing voice but when he was  the captain died in grief henson shipped aboard a newfoundland fishing boat then went ashore to work as stevedore messenger laborer and finally stock boy in venezuela peary found henson stocky and hard muscled he wielded a machete with the best breaking trail for days through steaming jungle he became a good rifle shot and an expert canoeman he was promoted to pearys personal survey crew still peary refused to think of him as anything but a valet peary was convinced of the white mans superiority favored educated men as explorers and had romantic faith in men who had belonged to a college fraternity preferably in bowdoin his alma mater when  the expedition ended peary offered henson a job as his personal messenger and a chance to accompany the first of his arctic expeditions once again however matt was entered on the ships papers as personal servant peary also took his genteel young wife and four men including dr frederick cook who would one day challenge pearys discovery of the north pole the expedition was to explore northern greenland to see if it offered a land bridge to the pole henson was to fetch and carry for mrs peary while the others explored henson handled his servant chores without complaint and was the indispensable handy man carpenter hunter and cook in greenland the eskimos whooped with glee at sight of his dark skin they treated him to feasts of rancid blubber and auks decomposed in oil andtaught him how to build an igloo drive a dog team trap a seal and cross an ice crevasse in turn matt sang and played his concertina he learned the eskimo language so much better than the whites that he became chief negotiator with these sometimes difficult people the expedition was a success and back home henson helped peary with fund raising lectures they made  appearances in  days and raised  then in  they were off again although henson found himself again reduced to flunky he became pearys chief assistant in fact if not in name and one of two men who agreed to stay north an extra winter after the first sled treks bogged down he took part in the exploration that proved greenland to be an island marching  miles in  days and nearly starving to death once henson saved pearys life by dragging him out of a crevasse another time he saved him by toppling a charging musk ox with his last bullet at the end the third man was too sick to think of returning to the arctic a dozen picked scientists gentlemen and fraternity brothers had started the expedition now only henson stood ready to help peary try again henceforth in his writings peary praised henson highly and referred to him as my faithful colored assistant during the next few years henson accompanied peary on several trips to greenland and the arctic peary had the drive and endurance of a man possessed but henson was tougher and in his own quiet way equally determined on one trek peary lay delirious on his sled while henson forced his eskimos to march over  miles of ice in  below zero weather on another peary staggered along in a daze of pain while henson kept the caravan moving hensons colored friends berated him for accepting shabby treatment without protest during a typical off summer henson worked as a pullman porter while peary vacationed on an island in maine what they couldnt understand was that henson was as  emotionally committed to reaching the pole as peary stuffy as ever peary filled his last expedition ship with scholars and gentlemen adventurers the amateurs did fairly well for a time but one by one they had to turn back eyes burning from snow blindness and fingers cracked and bleeding from frostbite finally all peary had left was henson bob bartlett a bear of a newfoundland sea captain and four eskimos to peary the eskimos scarcely counted the only choice was between henson and bartlett and the latter was plainly done in once again in the moment of crisis peary found himself staring into the steady brown gaze of matthew henson the final drive for the pole in april  was almost anticlimactic the expedition had leap frogged in building igloos and caching supplies so as to give the returning heroes a string of ready made camps the last camp was  miles from the pole and pearys party slogged in five marches the eskimos were dumbfounded when in the midst of a desert of ice peary took a sextant sight and in a voice flat with exhaustion announced that they had reached their goal after nearly  years of trying henson was in a mood to celebrate but something seemed to have gone out of peary he fell silent refused henson any show of comradeship and confined his gloating to his diary the pole at last the prize of three centuries my dream and goal for  years mine at last on the return trip peary was so worn out that he often had to ride a sled henson kept the sleds moving over  miles of ice but for dr cook henson might have fared better pearys party was still in greenland when word came that cook was in denmark claiming he had reached the pole a year earlier peary was furious and as the dispute became an international uproar henson was forgotten eventually most authorities agreed that cook could not have reached the pole meanwhile cook grabbed off most of the money and honors that might have trickled down to henson henson angered peary by trying to lecture on his ownand the two never saw each other again after they returned later as he was vindicated peary was showered with honors but all he ever did for henson was write a preface for his book a negro explorer at the north pole after  years exploring henson became a handy man in a brooklyn garage at   a week donald macmillan a white member of the expedition and later an arctic explorer in his own right badgered congress for years to get henson proper recognition four times bills were presented in washington    and  and four times they were bottled up in committee finally in  the explorers club of new york voted henson full membership he couldnt often afford the luncheons but it was something then in  years after the eventcongress struck off one medal honoring all the men on the peary expedition henson died in  at  after living for years on a pension of  a year

y trunk was packed the suitcases had been squeezed shut and as soon as i said goodbye to friends neighbors and relatives i would be ready to leave the great day had finally arrived and i was leaving for college i was going in the words of family and friends to git ah edgeecation it was a privilege and an honor to be able to go soon i was surrounded by everyone and their black brown and beige faces smiled at me through misty eyes filled with pride first one and then another pecked me gently on the cheek and pressed a hardearned dollar or two into my hand with it came a few words of homely advice be a good girl study hard and learn all you can child caint nobody take ah edgeecation away from you dont talk to strange men and finally do your best honey but dont worry up there you wont even know youre black i have had more than one occasion to take exception to the latter viewpoint but that is not important now the interesting thing is that i learned there was some truth to that statementyou wont even know youre blackduring my first spring semester at college i noticed the phenomenon when the lunch room began to have a shorter waiting line around the end of april where on earth was everyone i wondered but it didnt bother me much because a shorter line meant a smaller crowd in the dining roomand that meant bigger and better second helpings one day i returned to the dorm a bit earlier than noon and as i dashed toward my room to deposit my books i was flabbergasted by the sight of countless coeds clad in shorts bras swimming suits and anything else presumably decent they were carrying sunglasses bottles eyepatches towels blankets and an assortment of other things they were all headed in the same directionthe roof there were three negro girls in landon hall we were all crowded together in a twogirl room two seniors and a forestgreen freshmanthe latter yours truly my two worldly roommates were annoyed to put it mildly at my presence in the tiny room they let me know how they felt about living  with a freshman and i was worthy only of their contempt with their attitude in mind i decided it would be best not to ask them about the spectacle of seminude girls dashing toward the dormitory roof already i had a new complex i was learning about that in beginning psychology and was reluctant to ask questions i always seemed to be the only one who didnt know what was up or in this case why they were going up like the time during my first month at college when i was invited to a wiener roast wiener roast i discovered too late was coverup language for beerbust which was forbidden by school policy and which was really busted up by the police since then i have never had any inclination to go on a wiener roast even a bonafide one    complexes again one day i couldnt restrain my curiosity any longer i dashed back to the dorm before lunch and stood nonchalantly at the bulletin board shortly afterward the parade started the first freshman classmate i saw i grabbed by the arm pulled her around the corner and whispered where is everyone going with nothing onexcept the bare essentials she looked at me and her glance implied amazement then answered in a matteroffact voice for a suntan of course the of course passed me by and i pushed the point why why she blurted as though i had asked a stupid question why because its spring and everyone wants a suntan as soon as possible in the spring oh i see was my brilliant response it was something i needed long hours to ponder and ponder i did it had never occurred to me that anyone who wasnt tan would want to be but then a permanent tan such as mine seemed to be a tan of a different color i knew from the experience of living in a state with sourthern could be that misspelling was a freudian slip sympathies that there was something undesirable about having a permanent tan perhaps it was the novelty of the thing you didnt fade in winter and have the opportunity to bemoan your fate in being so utterly and disgustingly colorless a few months of the year it gave you nothing to look forward to in the spring no long hours of broiling and roasting in the sun no classes to cut for the more important occupation of lying idle soaking up the sunshine and flunking classes yes i decided it was a dreary fate that had assigned me the status of being born with a perpetual tan i puzzled over the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune long into the summer the daily trek to the roof continued and everyone well everyone minus three in the dorm spent countless hours broiling scorching and smouldering beneath the sun i listened during many heartrending hours with what i hoped was a sympathetic ear to the laments and tearjerking tales of my classmates and dormitory neighbors there was many a day when i was ready to weep at the cruelty of nature some of the poor things just couldnt tan    think of it they couldnt get any darker they made me feel guilty there i sat as brown as the proverbial berry and i had done nothing to enhance nature i was just born to negro parents and while that fact included certain builtin problems at least there was one problem i would never have to face neverthink of itnever would i taste the ecstasy of spending wasting countless hours sweating simmering and broiling beneath the feverish sun never the joy of rushing to the mirror to see if i was still raw medium or well done never the glance of envy from those poor unfortunates who couldnt tan as they watched me grow darker with each setting sun ah yes life does have its darker moments doesnt it well at any rate by the end of my freshman year some light had been thrown on the statement that up there you wont even know youre black there was one girl less inhibited than the others who used me as a gauge for her efforts at least once a week she bounced into my room grabbed my arm placed it next to hers and rejoiced at the ever diminishing difference the memory of that spring plus the annual antics of the sunworshipping multitude keeps me wondering i am anxious for the psychologists and sociologists to enlighten me i know it will take an explanation by one of these groups with words two inches long before im fully satisfied im sure it couldnt be anything as simple as the fact that a teasing tan is a mite pleasing to the eyes    natural or otherwise but perhaps that thought is too absurd especially when one considers the great wall of discrimination built around those who are identifiable primarily because of dark skin color in such cases its a lifetime tan but so far as i have noticed it is not exactly a status symbol  
the red chinese in africa
by brooks johnson
year or so ago an american diplomatic delegation went to a new african nation to open the new american diplomatic mission the group was eight strong and headed by a negro upon arrival in africa they found they had been preceeded by a red chinese mission which was  strong the red chinese govvernment had wisely recognized the new republic of guinea immediately upon its independence america had vacillated waited and lost valuable time and momentum to the red chinese did we expect that a negro and seven others could possibly offset the numerical and psychological gain that the red chinese already had other incidents of large chinese technical and advisory representations in africa have been reported these reports are doubly alarming when the implications involved are seen china with its own great internal development problems can ill afford to gamble with draining off this badly needed talent and sending it off to africa she can not unless she imagines that what she stands to gain from africa merits such a grave risk the game of power politics tells us that a gamble of this magnitude is not being taken for brotherly love what then in tangible and material values does africa have to offer red china it is felt by some that africa has the latent power to help solve many of chinas problems and to catapult china into the most powerful nation in the world one of the most pressing problems plaguing red china is her population in some fashion under some scheme it is a political and economic necessity that a sizeable number of her inhabitants must go lebensraum for the chinese can come from several places it can come from the area the russians took from them namely outer mongolia and sakhalin but this is highly unlikely the russians were not disposed to give them this land when relations between the two behemoths were warm it is not expected that the russians will be apt  to show any great generosity now that the relationship has cooled another area which might help china ease her population problem is south east asia but here again the chinese may find they are somewhat stymied the new federation of malaysia is a direct britishmalayan defense against red chinas expansion in that direction malaya the worlds largest producer of rubber and tin is one third chinese the malayans are deathly afraid of the bulging industrious chinese population there singapore eighth largest harbor in the world serves as the port and is the lifeline of malaya although it is a political entity in itself it needs the trade that passes to and from malaya or it will become just another swamp as it was before the tin and rubber trade made it the pearl of asia singapore is overwhelmingly chinese there cannot be any effective federation of malaya and singapore alone that will not have a sizeable chinese majority the problem has been neatly solved by adding the other british protectorates of brunei sarawak and north borneo as members of the federation in doing this the british have assured that the nonchinese population as illiterate and in many cases lethargic as it is will at least have a solid majority in adding these last three british protectorates they have also included the oil rich reserves of brunei the effect of all this if successful will be to deny the chinese the opportunity of taking over in the prementioned areas it should also be noted that in some of these areas the chinese minority has been defranchised harried and even stripped of property holdings some nations have nonimmigration laws against the chinese if china fails in south east asia she will no doubt have to look farther afield for her badly needed lebensraum the fact that africa for centuries has been a catchbasin for some of europes population overflow has not escaped the keen eye of the chinese communists one of the biggest problems that china faces also coincides with that of over half of the people in the world today    hunger china needs  million tons of grain and rice a year to feed her people she is able to produce about  million tons a few asian nations such as thailand have a surplus of rice to export most are like japan which has to import much of what she eats this reduces the amount available for red china because she has an unpopular credit system whereas nations such as japan pay cash this coupled with the overall fear many nations have of china causes her to lack a quarter of her needs even though she gets some grain from canada which in turn gets it from america it is very clear that mao tsetung does have a very pressing food problem the food problem of mao brings to mind the words of another dicta tor  mussolini mussolini said give me ethiopia and i will feed europe no one gave ii duce ethiopia with the tacit permission of the league of nations he took it but he never got around to feeding europe however having seen the rich plains of ethiopia it is easy to understand why he was moved to say this ethiopia has a fine rich soil in many areas there is an ideal average temperature of  degrees it is felt that in some areas crops can be harvested twice a year while in others it has been set at three times yearly ethiopia is not the only rich and arable land of africa but the very thought of such harvests must have set millions of hungry chinese mouths watering there are many other areas which could be made to produce enormous amounts of foodstuff with modem techniques and equipment any nation hoping to aspire to world prestige and power must have certain essential elements steel oil and technical skills are among the more basic prerequisites china is woefully deficient in the first two africa has the very rich mineral deposits south of the sahara and the oil of the libyan desert in all areas of subsaharan africa where minerals are to be found the chinese are not far away africa sorely needs to establish plants and facilities on her own soil to process her raw materials under the colonial system these treasures were taken to the colonizing nation processed and sold back to the african at inflated prices if processing is done in africa then africans will have more freedom and flexibility as to whom they can sell their products they will also be able to enter the international market on a fuller scale this the red chinese are working very hard to develop in the process of doing so they are not making themselves unpopular with the african economic developers the reason for the gamble china is taking in sending some of her crack technicians to africa becomes clearer when the potential of a combination between china and africa is seen both nations need and want more trade to reach their respective potential both are interested in seeing africa have more freedom regarding the disposal of her products africa needs technical aid which china has to a limited extent africa has large deposits of natural resources which china badly needs both want to see the disappearance of interference by western powers in this area it would appear that china would have an unlimited right of way directly into the economic capitals of africa but in her drive and designs on africa china has three major obstacles which frustrate her efforts they are the united stateswestern bloc influence and interests russian activity and programs and african nationalism the first two considerations are  important at present but there is some reason to believe they might become less so as time passes my reason for saying this is based on the following observations as africa grows stronger she will in the words of julius nyerere president of tanganyika pick    her own friends and we do not allow our friends to pick our enemies america has the greatest persuasive force of all as far as african friendship is concerned this force is  million in numberand black africans having had in most cases experiences with colonial oppression are very much attracted by democratic ideals this is natural and follows the same desire pattern as the american revolutionaries held after their fight for independence the united states being a democracy the oldest functioning one in the world has some direct parallels and comparisons it could make between the new african nations and the united states in both cases the continents of africa and america had to throw off foreign domination and colonial exploitation ironically the stories are almost carbon copies of each other the propaganda potential of the parallel is almost limitless the major flaw in the beautiful comparisons however is the treatment of the american negro in the united states despite their preference for democracy how can it be rationally believed that black africans can trust a nation which treats its own black citizens so undemocratically to further compound the situation the cases of undemocratic treatment of black africans themselves in the united states occurs with devastating regularity much of the black distrust of the united states could be overcome if the u s would merely uphold the law and the spirit of the declaration of independence and the constitution these things white americans everywhere take for granted there are some sections of the united states where a negro takes his life in his hands when he attempts to get even the most minimal benefit from these documents the racial folly of the united states is not limited to its national boundaries our white diplomats take their stateside prejudices to their posts in africa we have a report of e frederick morrow first black man in the white house who said that he was told that the wife of a diplomat about to be stationed in africa had the audacity and poor taste to let it be known to negro newsmen that she and her diplomat husband were very disturbed at being stationed in africa she and her husband considered it an injustice a step down and an extreme hardship it is known in many areas that the american colony sits off by itself in these countries and there is only a minimum attempt at contact between the american personnel and the native population programs such as the peace corps and some genuinely inter ested diplomats have to be spared this accusation americans have not omitted africa north of the sahara either while in libya i met and talked with a group of libyan employees of american oil firms doing business in the rich libyan oil fields one of the men had been sent by an american firm to the united states to study a phase of petroleum technology at the university of oklahoma upon his return to libya he was given the post of timekeeper the person holding the position he had been trained for was an american and did not have a commensurate background the american although not as skilled was getting several times more pay and privileges americans were discriminating against this man in his own country there were other examples related to me it seemed that there was enough discontent among many of the trained workers for them to form an informal organization based on the discriminatory practices of american firms operating in libya their goal was to pressure aging king idris not to renew contracts of the various firms when their agreements expired here we have a case of americans blindly cutting their throats with a doubleedged knife in one instance they train and educate a man under their contract agreement then once he has been taught how to do an important and vital function he is discriminated against when men are hired to perform this function the result is a group of highly trained men skilled in the vital operation of oil production who are dissatisfied with american methods these men are now organizing to force the american interests out here we have american capital paying for their training and american prejudices causing agitation for american departure russia is not to be found sleeping in regard to the potential that africa offers her activity in the congo crisis brought this dramatically to light just as china is having trouble feeding her masses we have been reading of similar problems arising from crop failures in the ussr food is not the only resource that africa offers the oil minerals and general discontent of the people of africa are prime targets for communist designs in the area but the russian effort is thwarted in several ways like the americans they seem to be their own worst enemy we have read of african discontent at discriminatory practices in certain communist countries of the balkan sea area it is also known that the same practices and complaints have come from those who found themselves in schools in russia itself further the africans have looked with some concern on the ruthless russian suppression of the hungarian revolt for selfdetermination were the hungarians seeking anything more than the africans themselves want in africa itself the russians  like the americans are running into a type of social suicide the russian technicians and advisors are very exacting and demanding in the standard of performance they expect on the technical projects they supervise they make no attempt to conceal their contempt for african workers who are not as adept as their advisors would have them be this of course is unfair to an african who is just beginning to learn the skill at which he is employed he reacts unfavorably to the russian conduct and opinion concerning him after all is the russian so unlike in mannerism and demeanor the european who formerly looked down his aquiline nose at him the african has labored against almost impossible odds to win independence in order to succeed in his desire for independence of the white mans rule the african has had to undergo great pressures and stress in order to accomplish this a strong will and faith was needed there had to be a focal point there had to be something around which he could attach his dreams this substance that he drew upon the thing that sustained him was an intense identification with his heritage his land and his color this has been called nationalism the more tyrannical the rule he had to overthrow the more intense the sense of nationalism became in many instances this nationalism was diverted to racial lines the whole problem was simplified for mass digestion and became black against white politicians today in many areas of africa find it impossible almost to win an election with pleas for moderation on the race question because there is such a strong feeling in many areas against whites from whatever country the chances of russian communism getting too strong a hold in africa are proportionately reduced by the same token the americans are not much better off this is especially so when the african hears of the discrimination practiced against black people in the united states the red chinese did not suffer as much from the color barrier as the other countries that are anxious to get a foothold in africa the chinese are not white and can more palatably speak in terms of their brotherhood with the african the biggest act of aggression of which the chinese have been guilty outside of their own borders is against the indians in many areas of africa however the indian is somewhat persona non grata this is because it was usually the indian who predominantly constituted the merchant class he was not exactly white and did not necessarily consider himself black like most businessmen he was reluctant to see the status quo upset and his proprietary interest put in doubt he naturally seemed to favor the colonial power even in cases where the colonial power refused to grant him full franchise in the civil_rights area this middleoftheroad feeling did not endear the indian to the african so the chinese do not have a race question or a hungary to mar their propaganda efforts the fact that both the african and chinese are colored does not seem to be sufficient to bridge the gap between the relationship that now exists between china and africa and what the chinese so fervantly want it to be china is daily growing further and further away from russia this not only involves ideological separation and alienation it necessarily involves economic and technical alienation also china is hard put to find other areas to fill the voids that the withdrawal of russian aid and cooperation will bring about the natural and most profitable place would be africa africa has a need for some of the things china can supply as limited as her technical resources may be china still has more than is now present in africa the chinese technicians unlike the russians and other advisors are more tolerant and patient with the apprentice african bonds of color tolerance and mutual need are being welded between the african and the chinese with western prejudice and ineptness serving as a catalyst the west with its arrogance and racial stupidity seems to be in no real position at present to stem or stop chinese progress in africa the soundest speculation as to what will prevent africa from becoming dominated by red china would center around africas intense desire to remain free of foreign domination it does not take a great deal of perception to see that a combination of china and africa is potentially one of the most formidable alliances conceivable one of the very real and potent advantages that china has is the solution to the south african and portuguese colonies in africa julius nyerere made it quite clear in a recent speech at the national press club in washington d c that african leaders consider it most urgent and necessary that africans in these areas gain their independence and control of their country when asked what the united states ought to do about the situation in the republic of south africa he said america ought to convince south africa that she america means to defend freedom wherever it is in danger with everyone present aware that the means of defending freedom in south africa is through the use of arms it was blatantly clear that he was calling for armed support from the united states in the struggle for the freedom of the black south african it was also very plain to all present that the united states europe or russia would not undertake such a drive there may have been some relief in the minds of some as they realized that the united states europe nor russia would hazard such a venture but there was also some dread on the faces of others who realized that china was not in all  probability afraid to take such a risk south africa is the richest and most developed nation in africa it may very well prove someday to be the pivot point of all africa with its technical skill and advancement coupled with a black administration it would have to play a most dominant role in any united states of africa if western recalcitrance on the apartheid policy there provides for red china to send in liberation troops or in some other way gain a foothold there then china would have a valuable satellite from which to influence the policies of the remaining african nations not to mention the bolstering of her own economy even assuming that china is not able to gain any real control in south africa she still could derive a great deal of goodwill by having the courage to assist other african nations which feel it is imperative that action be taken in south africa of course the same goodwill would fall to any other nation forthright enough to assist actively in the south african crisis in the even of a limited nuclear war china is one of the few nations which could survive the population lost in a sense it would be a blessing for them in terms of area mass the two areas in question constitute a sizeable portion of the world in the event of a continued peace the alliance is still one of great power it becomes patently clear that if china is given unrestricted even limited but effective access to the resources of africa she will then emerge at the least as the third major power in this instance she will have to be considered in any plans to ensure the peace keeping her outside of the united nations will be impractical and impossible if we are to continue seeking world understanding and peace through this body it would appear than any sustained peace will have to resolve itself through the machination of some international body such as the un if china is allowed to draw upon the resources of africa there will naturally arise a system of interdependencies and common interests in world affairs much like that which now exists between countries of the western bloc with the new common interests and bond with africa and the added influence her power will be able to exert in asia we have an international organization with china at the fulcrum the afroasian bloc will have the majority of the votes in any such organization and will therefore be able to dominate it to some degree the men who most fear and abhor such a condition most are too deeply immersed in their own dumb arrogance and stupid prejudices really to do much about this it is they in their amazingly narrow and shallow perspective who feed gasoline to the flame of which we speak it would appear that the salvation of the westrn blocas the western bloc likes to picture itselfis no longer up to the western bloc it is now in the hands of the africans the salvation of the western bloc in its position of power and prestige lies with the very force which was employed to throw off the influence of this bloc in africa in one wordnationalism africans have had to fight too hard and too long to allow their prized possession to fall into the hands of another outside power the pressures and stresses hardships and pains which the western world placed upon them forced them into a type of national cohesiveness which all but reversed the trend and flow of history this spiritual substance is not easily dissipated it is not likely that the africans will give up their hardearned independence to any outside nation the scars are still too recent from the last such foreign influence it will be this fear and jealousy that will stop the red chinese short of their ultimate goal in the meantime we can no doubt depend upon some economic social and cultural intercourse between the two giants this will undoubtedly benefit both in some areas let us hope that as they prosper and gain material goods their interest will more equate and align itself with those of the western world ensuring that some degree of permanent and harmonious integration on an international scale will result

er since civil_rights leaders have been protesting job discriminate ej tion and threatening to sr££ boycott any company that doesnt hire negroes the major corporations have been searching desperately to have at least one negro on the payroll in something more than a menial position for the first time the collegeeducated negro is being wooed by large companies who need him desperately to avoid a national boycott since most of the big companies have never hired negroes for executive positions before they really are at a loss as to how to go about it the search is going on very quietly and no one is willing to talk about it but the competition is getting so fierce that we wouldnt be surprised if it went something like this two vice presidents of the mackerel soda co are sent to interview thomas jefferson jones who holds a ba and an ma and a doctor of philosophy degree from mit before birmingham jones was working as stockroom clerk in a large new york department store but now everything has changed mr jones the first vice president says wed like you to join our company in an executive position if i understand you correctly jones says youd like me to be your executive negro no nothats not it at all the second vice president says weve been searching for some time for somebody with your qualifications to head up our interdepartmental bottling  sales liaison what is that exactly its a new job which would require you to consult and report and make suggestions on managerial procedures that could improve consumer interest on a company level i see jones says but youd want me to sit near the door as a matter of fact we would but that has nothing to do with the job why do you ask the star rubber co offered me a similar position provided id sit near the door so anyone who came in could see they hired negroes but that isnt our main concern mr jones we are much more interested in getting the best team possible for the company im sure of that jones replies what would my title be we hadnt given it any thought the ezra light  gas co offered to make me executive vice president in charge of broken meters we could make you vice president in charge of refunds on bottles that sounds pretty good jones says what does it pay twentyfive thousand dollars plus fringe benefits plus a house in an allwhite neighborhood and police protection for a week while you move in the wagon train food co offered  fringe benefits and membership in their company country club well meet the offer one of the vice presidents says on the other hand jones says the frothy dairy co offered me  a year and a stock option as well as a bonus and profitsharing plan all right well meet it just sign here i cant gentlemen jones says why not the department store where i used to work as a stockroom clerk has just made me chairman of the board what are you going to do for them one of the vice presidents asks sit near the door 
the soul of modern jazz
by leroi jones
think there are very  few people who are r close to jazz who  would dispute the fact that the three most important saxophonists in all jazz history up to now have been coleman hawkins lester young and charlie parker there have of course been other important jazz saxophonists but these three men have been more than just brilliant instrumentalists and gifted improvisors what is most important is that they were innovators and lasting influences on their contemporaries and every other jazz musician to come after them no matter what instrument they might play just as you once could find and can still find piano players or guitarists who patterned their styles on what louis armstrong did on trumpet so you can find diverse instrumentalists making curious or not so curious uses of what bean pres and bird have done charlie parkers influence is just as important to postbop piano players as it is to saxophonists even a musician as patently individual as vibist milt jackson must admit to being heavily influenced by the coleman hawkins attack there are guitar players and trombone players whose styles owe a great debt to lester youngs behindthebeat cool definition of jazz but as far as jazz saxophone the same time and still come up with something beautifully singular one thinks immediately of a tenor man like lucky thompson who seems to have understood both hawkins and young equally and to have arrived at an astonishingly original use of both those antithetical concepts of tenor saxophone playing gene ammons is another fine tenor player who puts both young and hawkins to work in his own playing and manages to emerge as a fascinating stylist charlie rouse yet another and of course there are many more the point is that for every paul quinichette say who was content to utilize merely lester youngs heavy influence or sonny stitt who could hear only parker or chu berry who was fastened to hawkins there were other players who were able to take some of the strongest qualities of two of the innovators or even all three after bebop and the emergence of charlie parker as the third giant of the jazz saxophone and fashion their own personal styles it is possible to trace the development and ascendancy of the saxophone in jazz by citing just what each of these three men contributed coleman hawkins is known by most jazz people as the man who invented the saxophone it was bean who first made the sax a respectable instrument as far as jazz musicians were concerned before his appearance the instrument was used largely for its novelty effect in dance bands and those hotel or theatre groups known as mickey mouse bands hawkins took the horn and inspired by louis armstrongs trumpet technique developed a huge tone and a smooth onthebeat approach to saxophone phrasing that brought the instrument into its own as a jazz solo voice and for a long time after hawkins almost anyone who played the instrument sounded like him    there was just no other way lester pres young brought the tenor saxophone to perhaps an even more autonomous position as a solo instrument instead of emulating hawkins wide toned onthebeat eighth note approach pres inspired as he said by the cmelody saxophone of frank traumbauer brought a light flowing gauzy tone to the tenor he also liked to lag just a little behind the beat and accent this penchant by laying out or resting at them unusual places in a phrase and then swooping lazily but impeccably back into the phrase as if he had never stopped playing hawkins saxophone work as impressive as it was was really just an extension of the louis armstrong trumpet style to another instrument but young made for the first time a music that was strictly a saxophone music and his flexible almost uncanny rhythmic sense provided a model for many of the young musicians who came along in the s to produce the music called bebop since young jazz has become increasingly a saxophone music in the sense that the musics chief innovators since that time have been saxophonists from the earliest days of jazz the chief solo instrument had been the trumpet and trumpet players like the fabled buddy bolden freddy keppard king oliver and louis armstrong the musics most illustrious soloists but hawkins demonstrated how powerfully jazz could be played on a saxophone and young made the saxophone potentially the musics most expressive instrument alto saxophonist charlie parker was one of the two most exciting soloists jazz has seen so far the other of course being louis armstrong and as such he made jazz musicians even more saxophone conscious after parker trumpet players piano players guitar players bass players etc all tried to sound like him in much the same fashion as all kinds of instrumentalists had once tried to sound like armstrong parker made the conquest of the music by the saxophone which young had begun very nearly complete since young we have had roy eldridgc dizzy gillespie fats navarro miles davis clifford brown all as brilliant trumpet soloists but the chief innovators have been saxophonists and just as parker was the soul and fire of the bebop era in fact most jazz saxophonists are still heavily indebted to him it is still saxophonists who are the fiercest innovators in contemporary jazz right at this moment three of the most daring innovators in jazz are saxophone players and a curious coincidence is that like hawkins young and parker the proportion remains the same that is two tenor saxophonists and one alto player make up the triumvirate the tenor men are sonny rollins and john coltrane the alto player is ornette coleman the most controversial of the three of the three rollins has been on the jazz scene the longest having come up with the second generation of boppers rollins like everyone else of the period was deeply affected by charlie parkers music and his style on tenor has always shown parkers influence but by the mids rollins came into his own and began to play his own horn and since then he has become an extremely ubiquitous influence himself in fact rollins was perhaps the strongest voice of the recent hard bop trend it was a trend that was marked by a return by many jazz musicians to what they considered their roots as a reaction to the soft timbres and rigid arrangements of cool jazz saxophonists began to utilize wider and harsher tones of which sonnys was the widest and harshest and most expressive and accompanying piano chords became more basic and simplified often relying on a sort of gospel or churchy feeling to emphasize the afroamerican beginnings of the music this trend still persists in what is called soul music or funky jazz which is still enjoying a great deal of popularity but rollins has since gone on to deeper and even more expressive things albums like way out west freedom suite and saxophone colossus showed that sonny was interested in being more than fashionable and he still had more experimenting to do john coltrane after playing with various rhythm and blues groups and one of dizzy gillespies big bands late in the s began to be noticed in the middle s as a member of the miles davis quartet and quintet coltranes biggest influence for quite awhile was dexter gordon who also influenced rollins and was one of the earliest people to transfer parkers approach to the tenor saxophone coltrane was also struck quite a bit by rollins but by the time he finished playing with thelonius monks wild groups  he was well on his way to becoming one of the most singular stylists in jazz the youngest of the three current saxophone innovators is alto man ornette coleman he is also the one whose innovations have been most challenged by many jazz critics and musicians whose short sightedness makes it difficult for them to accept the genuinely new just as young and parker were for a long time considered charlatans or merely inept except by a few musicians and critics who tried to understand what they were doing so young coleman has had a difficult time of it but he has been to my mind the most exciting and influential innovator in jazz since parker and even though coleman didnt arrive on the big time jazz scene until  he has already managed to influence to quite an extent the other two major innovators rollins and coltrane not to mention the myriads of other younger players regardless of their instrument rollins and coltrane had mature styles before ornette coleman was known even to jazz insiders rolins huge tone which often sounded like coleman hawkins paraphrasing charlie parker and his ability to improvise logically and beautifully from thematic materials rather than chordal were the things that characterized his precoleman style coltranes sound was and is smaller and less rigid than rollins and because of its striking similarity to a human cry it can often raise the hairs on the back of your neck rollins seems always to address himself to any extemporization in the most formally logical manner while coltrane strings seemingly endless notes and scales together making what some critics called sheets of sound coltrane and coleman have almost diametrically opposing approaches to a jazz solo coltranes music takes its impetus and shape from the repeated chords that harmonically fix the tune in fact he plays sometimes as if he would like to take each note of a chord and sound it singly but at the same time as the overall chord it is like a painter who instead of painting a simple white paints all the elemental pigments that the white contains and at the same time as the white itself but ornette colemans music has been described as nonchordal that is he does not limit his line to notes that are specifically called for by the sounded chord the form of a coleman solo is usually determined by the total musical shape of what he is playing that is the melody timbre pitch and of course the rhythm all of these moved by ornettes singularly emotional approach to jazz in much the same way as the older primitive blues singers produced their music and this has been his largest influence on the two older men this freedom that coleman has insisted on in his playing has opened totally fresh areas of expression for coltrane and rollins as well but in the context of their own demandingly individual conceptions on rollins latest records such as our man in jazz victor lps and club dates or on coltranes recently recorded live impulse a or inperson solos the influence of this revived concept of free improvisation based finally on the oldest sense of form in afroamerican music the individual reaches its most impressive manifestation and of course ornette coleman himself on his records or in person continues to excite intrepid jazz listeners all over the country with the fierceness and originality of his imagination at this point in jazz the most imaginative voices continue to be saxophonists though the pianist cecil taylor has also to be cited in any list of recent innovators in jazz and it would seem that not only have rollins coltrane and coleman learned from the three original saxophone innovators hawkins young and parker but they also seem seriously intent on becoming innovators of the same stature it is certainly not a farfetched idea

eginning with mr pavlovs celebrated ca    nine there has been  sufficient number of experiments in producing neuroses in animals to establish a universality of behavior patterns of animals under artificial conditions and to outrage the aspca the reactions of a guinea pig for example to the repeated stimulus of electric shocks might include asociality loss of appetite or behavioral bizzarrerie in general in the animal homo sapiens negro genre however the reaction to the attention paid the group en masse has been the most curious form of introspection i am a homo sapiens caucasian genre an easterner by birth but a californian since  i grew up in ivory suburbia and for many years my contacts with negroes were tenuous deprived of knowledge by lack of social contacts with negroes i found it easy to accept the conventional image of the negro the boy image the rhythmic relaxed obedient and perennially faithful servant a slightly benevolent variation of the white southerners good negro concept i also found it easy to sniggle at racial slurs and jokes purveyed by my contemporaries in my imagination as in theirs the negro albeit on american soil remained one with the jungle and his culture essentially african in those days my knowledge of african culture was even more negligible than my contacts with negroes living in a los angeles suburb until recently devoid of negro residents i tended to regard any negro es seen in the city as some sort of curiosity this continued until  when my aboutface was accomplished in a most forceful manner in september of that year thenpresident eisenhower ordered federal troops to little rock to enforce desegregation i began to do some wondering who were these peo pie what could be so offensive about a people that they had to storm doors through which i could pass unnoticed i had not realized in my relative security that below me socioeconomically were people who strained against the iron chains of whitesmy peoplesignorance and who had to struggle to attain those things i took for granted aroused i began to read constantly on the matter of race i sampled james baldwins notes perused states rights literature and immersed myself in native son the result was an even more gripping obsession with race problems my interest in the matter redoubled finally when i decided i was old enough to go for myself i deliberately sought the negro neighborhood obtained quarters and with enormous selfconsciousness took up residence nothing happened i couldnt get over it it was all the same as it had been before the same play with a different cast i admit in retrospect that i had been brainwashed i had expected to find tribal customs and a backward way of life when i didnt i was frankly surprised my selfconsciousness subsided and i decided that as far as i was concerned it was all the same there was no need for scholarly theses exploring negro culture or comparing it to white culture no need for doctorates on inter or intraracial relations  notes of a native son but was there as i became wellacquainted with the other tenants in the building a strange phenomenon began to unfold it seemed that the negro so long the object of white americas social microscope has been made so inescapably aware of race that he has begun to interpret the behavior for which his socioeconomic level environment or even his individuality is responsible in terms of race until i discussed this in earnest with a negro lady whom i liked and whose company i sought i had taken cum grano salis glancing references by negroes to racial behavior coming from a close friend and companion however from one who held as tenaciously to her own philosophy as many a southern white holds to his own it was upsetting economic practices alleged inter and intraracial relations even the matter of sexuality were ascribed to race we people soon became just as overworked and just as blanket a phrase as the one the white man uses the negro i cannot remember how many times i was told you just dont understand our people had i sampled only the icing on the cake where had been the truth in my youthful fantasies about the negro and the negro community the wrightinduced visions of endless rending of pornographic songs seminude figures sitting in littered airshafts of fivestory walkups where were the myriad vices of which negroes had been accused it had not taken long for my own experience to shatter the myths surrounding the negro and to establish that the only differences between the negro race and other races were epidermal yet in an instant i doubted all over again it seems likely that the negro does not call these alleged racial characteristics to his defense as scripturally as he would invoke the enviable accomplishments of such as ralph bunche and daniel hale williams to establish his capability and capacity for similar greatness rather it seems that through the intensity of attention focused on him and because of all that has been said and written of him by his own and by others he has actually come to take some of these things quite seriously the negro has been under the social microscope for so long and to the exclusion of practically all the other minorities on this continent that he has begun to take a peek for himself to find out what is so darn interesting about him there is little doubt that the information that is offered in this manner is an attempt at racial enlightenment an attempt to effect racial understanding but the constant drumming on we people instills white minds with one idea negroes are different and it is but a short step from different to unfit for firstclass citizenship or if you will social equality by unconsciously purveying suggestions of unbridgeable differences between the races and by unwittingly perpetuating in some instances the vicious sexual legend that has so long handicapped him and debarred him from his birthrights many a negro has been his own worst enemy it is a strange and sad truthbut many a negro fails to see himself as he would have others see him by falling for the cliches and nebulous stereotypes that spring automatically to many white minds he has actually placed roadblocks in his own path and is finding it harder to surmount them than it was to erect them

could it be at long last that negro women are going to be permitted to come into their own as romantic heroines if the careers of two increasingly important young actresses can be used as weathervanes then such a climate seems at hand the two young women are cicely tyson and diana sands both enormously talented and on the rise in the uncertain world of show business now of course young negro actresses have achieved fame and fortune before and the names of lena horne and eartha kitt and dorothy dandridge come immediately to mind but there is an important difference misses horne and dandridge are negro beauties with features virtually indistinguishable from those of their caucasian fellowstars and miss kitt is all feline sex and grace properties both rare and raceless on the other hand misses tyson and sands are beauties in the negro mold the one satindark and smoldering the other highcheeked fulllipped and tigerish miss tyson has a featured role in this seasons tv series

fitting idol for negroes since he advocated separate development and douglass was unacceptable both because he insisted upon an equal role for negroes and because he married a white woman it is

oung mrs lee pulled her rosecolored velvet morningrobe more regally about her as she stood she lifted her firm young chin up and away from the snowy froth of lace collar and swept out of the shining sunny breakfastroom her heart beat it knocked against her ribs her fine blue eyes were aglow with righteous wrath the newspaper she held was bunched and gathered in her fist and torn by her impotent anger she marched into her kitchen that was so yellow and fresh in the morning sunshine where light dancing along the chrome and porcelain surfaces sent silvery reflections to glimmer against the pale enameled ceiling peace and prosperity dwelt in the room the clean cabinets were neatly crowded with the finest condiments and all manner of delicacies and the aroma of the splendid breakfast still stood upon the warm air ennis bulked at the sink her aging hands deft among the rainbow soapsuds she was humming a minor tuneless upanddown melody that had no form it was strangely sweet her heavy gray oiled hair was done up in a tight neat bun and her large body was encased in an icewhite uniform that creaked when she moved so stiff it was with smooth oldfashioned handbeaten starch young mrs lee gathered together her breath and her courage she well knew that she was overstepping a most delicately balanced social boundary but she did not care she had to speak up this once or burst so filled was she with that noble emotion called moral indignation ennis she said ennis turned smiling her hands gone quiet in the warm water yesm young mrs lee held out the crumpled raddled paper ennis i wish to apologize to you for this atrocitythese atrocitiesi wish i could tell you just how really sorry i am about it about all of it ive been reading it herehow that school wont let that young man indid you see it of course you must have and ennis i think its dreadful all he wants to do is go to school what makes people so cruel its a terrible thing a perfectly terrible thing and im so sorry about it about everything and i do mean it so she gazed earnestly at ennis her azure eyes quite damp and she decided right then and there to give the maid an extra week off with pay in the summer perhaps it would help to offset the years of black pain black panic and black loss that she suddenly thought she understood all of mrs lees days had been spent in the midst of clean serene spaciousness she had never worked for money for the sake of her belly she had always possessed shining slippers for her little feet with new ones wrapped in tissue for sundays and special occasions she had forever owned her pinkish flesh her yellow hair and her blue eyesand her absolutely inalienable rights lately however she had found herself trying to dismiss the fact that something queer was going on out in the nonfashionable part of the world that just outside her white and exquisitely panelled front door there was great lamentation and an ominous rending of the very air sometimes she feebly discussed events with her husband and acquaintances but the conversations would always return to the old safe grooves such as the schoollunchprogram the latest dirty good bestseller and the doings of certain couples she saw ennis as an enormously capable shadowy extension of herself until this morning when she read the papers and looked at her servant she dazedly realized that ennis was a human that ennis had a life the maid did not vaporize at five oclock she went home to a ghetto she went home to crime and sex and dirt if ennis was disturbed by mrs lees awkward and extraordinary outburst she gave no sign of it she was used to masking her emotions in the presence of white people of exercising a certain amount of reserve but now she turned all the way around and looked at her mistress eyebrows high that boy aint had no busness goin down there and stirrin things up miz lee she said aint gonna make things no easier fo nobody but they want to kill him ennis if it hadnt been for those federal troops hed be dead them soljers aint gonna be round long then he wont neither mark me miz lee he shouldna never done it fus thing you know evbody be fightin and we gets long fine up here you jus got to tend t yo busness and pay yo bills and try t make it bes way y kin you do so have trouble here ennis i think hes truly trying to do something about it hes trying to end an old and terrible wrong cant you see how y gonna end trouble by makin trouble ennis asked by stirrin up riots and all we got t grow to it its gonna come but that boy caint cram hisself down nobodys throat an spect em t like it we gots t git it slow it got to be earned y like me t vite mself t yo nex pahty yes cried mrs lee extravagantly you are hereby now in vitedif it would make one particle of difference ennis chuckled and returned to her dishes mrs lees voice was tremulous doesnt he have the right to go to any school that he wants to attend she went to stand close to ennis to look into the dark tired handsome face dont you want your grandson to have a better life ennis rinsed a fork and thought what is wrong with this white woman aloud she said we gots good schools    theys plenty schools he coulda gone to thout all this messmy granboy be all right his lifes bettern mine an my lifes easiern my mamas was those folks just outrageous they oughta rest in jesus why hes like jesus in a way ennis mrs lee replied tensely theyre killing him by inches did you see his face look at him she smoothed the wilted paper and looked again at the unsmiling haggard roundlipped face he can change the whole world she said after a time of silent contemplation and he has aged twenty years in a week how horrible it must be to be the target of all that hatred i wonder if it will affect him i wonder if it will inject him i wonder if you or i could have done this thing she continued to study the photograph with her curious interested pitying blue eyes ennis pushed eggshells carefully down the disposal shocked to hermarrow to compare that boy with jesus she offered up a tiny plea for forgiveness mrs lee glancing at ennis suddenly implacable face became aware of a feeling of chill she stood in her bright kitchen and wished that she had not spoken how much better it was to pretend that life was not uncomfortable her own little existence was a delight she owned long days all embellished with frantic rushes to the hairdresser to club meetings to seven pm dinnerparties it would take her three hours to dress when she had a date with her husband for showandsupperintown she spent her leisure hours sunning going to dressfittings and driving in to the elegant jewelry shop to have her pearls restrung mrs lee balled up the newssheet and thrust it into the handsome copper wastebasket perhaps youre right ennis she said i suppose that nothing so basic can ever be changed she longed to say more much more something anything to ask a thousand questions to find logical answers to pierce the natural reticence to understand but simplicity is dead and so she rearmored her heart her awakening heart and put back her reaching hand if you have a moment she said smoothly will you whip up one of your marvelous cakes were having casual company tonight all right ennis murmured she listened to mrs lees pretty mules go tapping away across hardwood floors and she thought what do you know about life livin on cream n peaches the way you do   livin in a big house with all kind o help    payin eighty dollars for dressfrocks    takes me two hard weeks to get me eight o yo dollars grow up in a dirtfloor shack that sleep six on the floor that is life be made a kitchen and laundry slavey when you are seven and learn quickly to move faster than a fist can fly that is life learn intimately all manner of evil that is done by barbaric anglos and africans and think for years that it is the way that life is lived that is life know instinctively the sweet art of making a dollar and a lousy dime do the work of five that is life be matriarch over a clan of weak semijobless males who are always drifting away over the shrill conniving women over the struggling wrathful children who are veering away from all of the old beliefs they come to me they cry to me and im the one who must work and rule and wear this crown of thorns ennis deftly ran a damp mop over the shining floor she picked up the wastebasket put it down and fished out the crumpled newspaper she fitted together the tompieces and stared into the young mans resolute eyes can you make a better life fo my granboy she asked him silently so he wont get filled up wit pain and go out t steal an put lovebabies ill weep over in frowsyheaded women so he aint nevah gonna care bout standin round on corners in th sun at leven clock on a workday momin if you really be th start o sumthin better son why then ill walk wit you i is tired an th women like me are tired an its high time you menfolk gave us a han she began to stack away the pretty plates upstairs in her perfumed bath mrs lee let soapsuds gather in the soft water both of them were deep in painful thought       relatively young mr lee was not a cruel man he gave lavishly to carefully chosen charities and he paid his taxes with a reasonably willing heart he had broken bread on numerous occasions with orientals and even jews and he often slipped extra dollar bills to ennis thin owleyed grandson when the boy came up on saturday to tidy up the patio however he did not at all share his wifes timidly liberal point of view during breakfast he had snapped the paper as he read the ugly news sneering at the chaotic photographs he had treated ennis with a civil contempt although he did manage to eat four of her delicious biscuits on the train that morning his annoyance was further fanned by conversations he held with his fellow commuters who also dimly viewed the notion of a black ape trying to force his way in where he definitely wasnt wanted they comforted themselves with piously regretful prophecies for they were not unkind men they honestly believed that a nigger should be content with what he possessed because at the most it was so much better than what he might be getting why he could be still dashing about in a jungle someplace  mr lee forgot about the outside world when he entered his new office he loved his work he loved mastering the intricacies of engineering and special design and the look of crisp new artwork gave him great pleasure he liked the abstruse clipped language that so confused the layman he hung away his hat and tweed overcoat with one hand and reached for the overflowing in basket with the other the telephone rang almost immediately it was dave lane down in first in personnel dave had an engineer in hand he was sending him up to get squared away qualifications supremely superb lee lane chortled snapped im up names wheeler dont let im get outta the buildin great mr lee told him buy you lunch for that he hung up feeling fine now everything would go along smoothly again he hated it when the office routine was upset he told his secretary to send mr wheeler right in when that gentleman arrived the young man walked with confidence his lean face wore a most expressive noncommittal expression and he walked his full six feet no hunch no slouch on the heels of his dully shined black shoes he wore a neatly understated suit and his tie was impeccable he walked his full six feet down the long aisle that led to mr lees door and the people sitting at the desks looked up then looked again staring some of them narroweyed some of them looked at him with an interest that was not at all malign mr lees secretary smiled up at him im bill wheeler he said handing her a card yes she replied mr lane called us she buzzed her boss mr wheeler has arrived she cooed without further ado she rose and ushered mr wheeler into the inner office the white mans bluish eyes blazed suddenly he recovered in a twinkling and greeted the prospective employee pleasantly taking the cards and folder from his secretary with a small gracious smile sit down mr lee indicated a chair that was pulled up close to his desk billy wheeler is it thank you yes mr wheeler sat down he glanced unobtrusively about him as mr lee studied his papers the room was handsome he looked at mr lee middlingofage receding hair of good stock odorless a good tailor practiced bland eye the silence grew you have been busy mr lee said as he turned over a paper or two he looked up at bill wheeler smiling he leaned back in his comfortable chair and picked up a pencil we are at present engaged in a variety of programs mr wheeler all infinitely important we are concerned with design technological processes specification review we study the theory of estimation multivariate analysis decision theorywere a tight little group up here and we all work very hard do you think that you would be willing to work weekends and late at nighti know how you like your saturday nights ha ha as do we all he thought in fury what the devil does dave mean sending a dinge up here aloud he went on smiling ever work with principal scientists i was with a company that employed them mr wheeler answered showing his teeth also we got along famously uhhum mr lee tapped the folder once with his very sharp pencil you were in civil service he looked at wheeler yes bill wheeler said its all there in the resume sir but i wish to grow with a company well were considering everyone of course mr lee told him brightly pulling open a desk drawer and extracting a sheaf of papers i have several other applicants that id like to confer with ill call you mr lane the guy in personnel mr wheeler pointed to a card that mr lee had ignored im to receive instructions from you he hired me mr wheeler relaxed and took his gloves off im to start monday mr wheeler added mr lee felt the red blood swell his temples caution fled and the rage boiled over hed see lane about this later when he spoke though his voice was gentle he could have been speaking to a child why do you wish to work here we dont want any troublesome of our most capable employees might quit and the company couldnt afford that the position is exactly what ive been looking for bill wheeler told him im close to my home the salarys real good theres room for advancement and i want a job where i can work my mind to its capacity sir ive got a lot of good ideas but ive felt stifledid like to be more creative or somewhat creativeanyway this company has the tools that i need and ive got what the company wants he laughed a little i can even advise you on the transcient behavior of various types of stochastic processes  mr lee smiled not he simply sat and looked at the man the man talked like a white man he vore clothes like one he exuded selfconfidence like a white man who knew his trade the nigger seemed completely unaware of the very evident fact that he was not a white man mr lee looked at the closed folder the references were marvelous the nigger qualified god damn it have you tried any other employers mr lee pleaded he simply had to try your companys equal opportunity i believe mr wheeler said coldly i wish to work here oh yes mr lee shifted in his chair i didnt mean to imply that we did not hire your group but i had talked to someone else and i have not yet had the opportunity to inform mr lane how can that be sir in an outfit the size of this one i know that the avenues of communcation are better arranged than that would mr lane hire him he would on my sayso mr lee working with absolute stats and mathematical procedures ought by now to have given you a horror of equivocation weve never had negroes here any ever apply none ever qualified i qualify there is more to the position than that mr wheeler there are the personal relationships we often have little gettogethers youd feel uncomfortable and so would the others for their freedom ofspeech would be somewhat curtailed you understand so many places do hire your group and ive noticed that they also form their own little cliques you wouldnt have a thing in common with anyone here and the company outingssome tactless remarkyou have probably experienced iti do want to see your kind get ahead mr wheeler but i simply do not think that you would fit in here mr wheeler grinned faintly im not intimidated mr lee i have used knowledge as a wedge to open many and many a door it is penetrating selfenriching and it works you dont have to like me personally sir when you give me an order close your eyes mr wheelers voice was quietthere was even a tiny ripple of laughter accompanying his last words the vast forces in that tastefully furnished room were leashed but the thread was thin i have become hopelessly assimilated into your world sir i worship your god i have educated myself i have learned to care for bach and picasso i am a student of euclid your culture such as it is is mine it is all ive ever known and what else could i have done if you will take your heel off my neck i will show you what i can accomplish you swarm all over everything mr lee cried losing control his soul in torment and blacken the world maybe we are smart mr wheeler mused thoughtlessly i think that is why you fear us so he looked into mr lees bluish eyes carlyle once asserted that mans business was not to see what lies ahead but to do what lies at hand we blacks are realizing that we are going to have to do what lies at hand because your tomorrow for us isnt ever gonna come bill wheeler leaned forward his dark eyes living wells of light why cant you see that it has to be we cannot regress sir my little boy is wholly americani didnt mean to say thatbut mr lee it isnt your world any more there are more like me coming and im afraid that you are simply gonna have to get used to the idea wheeler spread his hands and looked down at them there are more like me coming mr lees eyes remained fixed on bill wheelers face he was remembering a scrap of conversation that he had heard in a plush bar one night he remembered a man saying   shortsighted ancestors left us with a problem now that the white mans burden is being shed whatre we gonna do for an encore and someone had said its inevitable isnt it and somebody else had spoken slowly viciously with quiet emphasis i think that well pull all civilization down around our ears first id light the first fuse gladly id set off a thousand hundredmegatons for i would rather die and rot unburied in the ruins of this earth than accept a negro as my equal mr lee stared at mr wheeler and he said to him do you think for one moment you shadow of a white man that i am going to help you take it away from me do you actually believe that i who waded hipdeep through blood and tears for centuries am going to stoop to give you a hand up do you really believe that i who perfected the arts of warring and living would willingly share the good of it all with you do you think that i want to share my verandah in the cool of evening with you in the cool of evening i want you there to bring my drink and fetch my slippers and i want to own the right to boot you off the place if i so desire and i will kill you to keep the privilege so said mr lee evenly and even gently in panic and out of a deeper emotion than even pain he added i have seen my women looking at you out of the corners of their eyes and there lay spoken the final truth mr wheeler looked at the pale implacable face he stood he held himself tightly for he wished to smash and destroy mr lee said into the silence i have hired an engineer i forgot to inform mr lane i am sorry we will of course keep your name on file the two of them regarded each other nakedly for a long and brittle moment  after bill wheeler had gone away mr lee sat on trying to control the trembling of his hands and legs if we educate them and treat them as though they are as good as white men they will smear us from the earth with their vitalitythey are so alive he swung about in his comfortable chair and looked through the big window down into the busy street it was good out there good for a man a white man the plattersized steaks in the smoky darkpanelled restaurants where the help was black and devoured their meat in the kitchen the long blonde women who stalked upon slender legs costing a man plenty sometimes even a marriage the tall bright trim buildings that housed the technological machinery that white men had invented the sweet expensive resorts the mountain lodges the country clubs where the grass was so greenly groomed and where the sunlight sparkled on the turquoise water in the heated pools the skiing holes the money the fine old traditions the homes that were so big and lovely    no god forbid oh blessed white god forbid it we can emphasize education mr lee thought maybe that will stop them maybe they wont be able to pursue us up this technological mountain if this wont work well then well just have to revert back to the stone age and declare war on them all all in that split second which followed his morbid cornered thought he realized dully and with a shrinking heart that they were going to have to yield the only alternative was violence and utter chaos the telephone jangled at his elbow startled he turned and looked at it grimly he turned about and yanked up the receiver epilogue bill said mr lee heres the info you wantedall herelisten you hear about the two new colored fellas they hired yesterday bill wheeler looked up in surprise no he replied smiling and accepting the datasheet thats swell well retorted mr lee sourly i just hope it works out i worked out murmured bill regarding his boss with his usual expression of gentle irony you growled mr lee you well hell youyoure different bill wheeler hunched over his work and mr lee stalked away grumbling happily to himself and after a little time one lone salted heartwrenched bitter wondering exasperated tear fell upon the pristine beauty of billy wheelers board

art
text by denise paulme
eneral awareness of negro art in all its forms  music the plastic arts literature   dates back to the years immediately following the first world war in london in paris jazz with its african ancestry conquered the musicians in may  the devambez gallery organized in paris the first exhibition of african and oceanian sculpture in  the editions de las sirene published the anthologie negre of blaise cendrars which brought together myths stories and proverbs of the african native in the same year the april issue no  of the review action edited by florent fels presented views on negro art of wellknown artists  and writers picasso juan gris jacques lipshitz cocteau andre salmon jean pellerinwhile from guillaume apollinaire who had died in november  came an extract from the article in the mercure de france where in april  he had devoted two pages to the fetichist sculpture of the black races these testimonies were not all eulogistic the dealer paul guillaume saw in african sculpture the quickening seed of the spiritual twentieth century but jean cocteau affirmed that the negro crisis in art has become as big a bore as mallarmes faponisme disparate views indeed but views from which one gleans the impression of a convergence between african plastic art and certain aspects of western art of that period in fact negro sculpture was first hailed as an art form by a group of painters living in paris at the beginning of this centuryvlaminck matisse and derain among others who frequented the galleries of the old trocadero while in london derain spent much time in the ethnographic department of the british museum in brussels a magnificent collection startingpoint of the museum of the belgian congo had been assembled for the  exhibition and has been on public view ever since among these souvenirs de voyage these curios artists who would one day be described as fauves and cubists discovered a new art form whose echo seemed to respond to what they themselves struggled to express in  the henri matisse collection included twenty or so negro statues derain braque and picasso were now the possessors of african masks at the same time a parallel movement began in germany in  the painters kandinsky and franz marc issued their blue rider in munich here side by side with the works of picasso matisse cezanne gaugin appeared childrens sketches glasspaints medieval carvings chinese paintings etc evoked by gauguin the south seas was again represented by a statuette from easter island a mask from new caledonia also a woodcarving from the cameroons a plaque from benin and a mask from gaboon two years earlier in the berlin of  there had appeared the black decameron of frobenius a miscellany of african myth and legend the work was quite beautifully written it not only commanded the respect of the specialist in negro art but also attracted the attention of people of culture throughout the west music plastic arts literature from  onwards africa was no longer the forgotten continent its existence was recognized along with intimations of the riches it was to reveal the first volume of aesthetics devoted to african sculpture was the negerplastik of carl einstein published in  einstein saw in negro statuary a profound and archetypal significance something worthy to inspire the modem artist overinfluenced by painting western sculpture had reached an impasse african sculpture according to einstein resolved the fundamental problem of the expression of volume of mass african sculpture alone in his view was true sculpture breaking with all academic formulas and reacting against the mannered impressionists which resulted in pictures where everything became dissolved in a cloud of coloured dust both fauves and cubists sensed the urge to forge a new style in search of signposts they turned towards negro art a term which for a long period embraced the divergent sculptures of africa and oceaniain much the same way that the impressionists before them had turned to the far east they in their turn sought above all else to find in the primitive arts arguments to justify their flight from convention negro art with its highlycommunicable sense of mass furnished the example of a tradition which its disciples claimed to be viable it offered too as bait the attraction of novelty it answered the taste for the exotic naive barbaric    these adjectives exalted the souls of amateurs who cared little for the exact source of the work in question still less for its initial impulse and meaning in the hands of the artist it is due to the research of ethnographers well schooled in the art of their period that for the past twenty years african sculpture has been given a richer deeper signifi cance they have been able to assign each single work to the period and community which gave it life as well as explaining its function its method of usage and its symbolic values the importance of the religious factor in all aesthetic activity of the african cannot be exaggerated means and ends integral parts are all imbued by this consideration to set out to judge a mask or statue of the african continent purely on the aesthetic planewilfully ignoring the artists motive forceis not less absurd than to pretend to study medieval sculpture while disregarding christianity such ethnographical museums as house the most important collections of african and oceanic art strive nowadays to adapt themselves to this double necessity they would be failing in their function if they were not also museums of art their choicest specimensa benin ivory for example a baule mask a baluba caryatidare invariably isolated from the rest placed at an angle and in a light which seems best suited to reveal their form and balance although it may not be essential to understand its precise significance in order to appreciate the form which is given to a piece of sculpture it is not unimportant to realize that african masks with rare exceptions are a male prerogative from which women are kept rigidly excluded in a number of societies myth attributes the in vention of masks to a woman who steals the disguises abandoned by demons the menfolk then proceed to seize them regarding the masks the symbols of poweras the sole means of enabling them to exert over their wives the superiority essential to the maintenance of social order the variety which we observe in the masks is explained by their purpose the effect of terror will sometimes be secured by a stylization where human elements blend with zoomorphic ones eg monkey buffalo and antelopemasks sometimes by an exaggeration accompanied by a simplification of facial planes sometimes again by a juxtaposition of colours of symbolic significance adjacent to these terrifying exhibits there are others which aim solely to entertain and relax the viewer it so happens that these comic masks appear on the heels of their horrific neighbours providing a breathingspace which has been judged to be necessary but the uninitiated critic who is ignorant of this division will judge both the one and the other impartially as being either beautiful or monstrous one statuette may evoke the memory of an ancestor while its neighbours mission is to protect its master against everterrifying black magic always to be feared yet another is acting a role in a ceremony of divination the last may be a dollone of a pair of twins and during his lifetime the survivor will feed wash and dress the statuettean image of his dead brother it is all this that the museum strives to evoke with the exception of certain pieces which have been deliberately isolated the emphasis in each case is on the role played by the sculpture in the society in which it has its origins    finally it would be absurd to suppose that all specimens are of equal value within a series originating from the same region the level appears to be more or less highthe masterpiece is always unique a single visit to a great museum is enough to show the differences which distinguish pieces from the same source or more or less derived from the same inspiration and obedient to the same stylistic exigencies w fagg who studied the present day yoruba sculptors in southern nigeria remarks on the aesthetic consciousness evinced as much by artisans as the patrons who order works from them a great sculptor can ask a higher price than the others and often gets commissions from distant towns and even regions where another style prevails  
recap on a dread disease 
by myron c golton 
young mothertobe a  lay on her back at the cook county hospital in chicago the doctor could see she was doing poorly ive had chills for the past week doctor she said tonelessly with a seeming resignation to pain and suffering she coughed it was not a hard cough but the effect was apparent her hand went instinctively to her right side to cup the pain in her chest slowly she turned to spit out the white sticky mucous  hows the baby going to come out all right a worrying fretful note appeared in her voice appears to be okay answered the doctor glad to be on a cheerful topic he was worried about the mother though her attacks of pains in the jointsthey were like rheumatic fever but were they something else was there in the background in her past medical history he was puzzled the picture was not complete it was like a cutout puzzle with pieces missing the offsounds when he tested her right chest could be pneumonia he made a written note of it there were other physical signs that bode no good yet her urine and blood hurriedly tested revealed little at halfpast ten in the morning she went into labor come on baby the world is waiting for you shell be proud of you be you boy orgirl what mother would not be chesty showing off her first child all this preliminary agony would be forgotten an hour later the poor little unborn parcel stopped sending out heart tone signals to the doctor tuning in with his shiny instrument no sense in telling the mother she was having a hard enough time of it she did not know soon enough better get on with the business and easy does it easy easy the way was not easy and the time was not short it was  more hours  long tossing straining crying hours before the baby was born for the baby it was late much too late for the mother it looked almost too late also she hung on desperately to that faint spark of life while they toiled around her trying to fan it to a blaze again six hours later the mother joined the baby when a postmortem examination was performed on the mother it was found that her red blood cells were long and whiplike in shape indicating that both she and her baby were victims of the dread disease sickle cell anemia the history of this case goes back  years to the time when the mother was herself a tiny infant just letting out her first cry to the outside world if some medic had taken a drop of her blood that first day of her life and smeared it flat across a glass slide and peered at it magnified many times under a microscope he could have foreseen  the tragic future but probably he too would have felt the helplessness of it for in those days sickle cell anemia was a medical territory virtually unexplored no one knew exactly what to do about it even today prospects are not too bright for this hereditary disease which is so peculiar to negroes and rarely ever found among whites as high as  in every  negroes examined have been found to have the oddly formed red blood cells which also take the shape of a crescent or a holly wreath sickle cell anemia was first detected  years ago at a free dispensary on chicagos west side while dr james b herrick was examining a young west indian a medical student who complained of weakness and loss of weight even today the disease is occasionally referred to as herricks disease normal red blood cells when floating through the body are shaped somewhat like a cupped hand placed under a microscope they resemble a collection of nickels or a stack of poker chips viewed edgewise they are barshaped with a swelling at top and bottom researchers have found that the inner pressure of oxygen keeps the cells puffed up to their natural shape in fact it is this oxygen pressure that furnishes the key to the difference between a normal and a sickle cell reducing the pressure they have discovered transforms the cells from normal to sickle this is important but there is much more to solving the mystery of the strange behavior of the blood looking for more information researchers roland b scott robert p crawford and melvin jenkins all doctors at howard university examined hundreds of negro infants at freedmans hospital in washington d c they found that the blood of only  per cent of the babies carried the ominous sickle cells when they examined older children however they found the percentage to be more than twice as high evidently the presence of these cells becomes more apparent or more numerous as the child grows older studying sickle cell traits among pregnant colored women doctors paul k switzer and heyward h fouche found that the disease usually appears before a woman is  years old once started it never lets up in fact it continues to aggravate ruthlessly dogging its victim to an early grave women with the disease have less children and are more prone to abortions researchers who examined  pregnant negro women at roper hospital in charleston south carolina found that one out of every seven possessed the sickle cells in their blood yet the study failed to disclose any ill effects three chicago doctors alfred j kobak philip j stein and august f daro considered the problem extremely grave during pregnancy they discovered many cases of the disease among negro women in the maternity wards at cook county hospital women who were thin and underdeveloped whose past medical history revealed frequent attacks of pneumonia and other respiratory infections who complained of joint and muscle and abdominal pains with nausea and vomiting usually were infected with sickle cell anemia many of the patients also suffered with leg ulcers and jaundice fellow doctors who practice in other hospitals and rarely come across the disease were advised to suspect it even though the symptoms indicated rheumatic fever tuberculosis syphilis or some other form of anemia when women infected with sickle cell anemia become pregnant they are fortunate if the baby is delivered successfully all too often it ends in abortion or stillbirth the doctor must watch the mothers health chart constantly when the deadly shock comes signaling a sudden interruption in the vital blood flow within the body the medic must work and think fast for he knows then that the oddshaped cells have formed clumps which have clogged up the liver and bottlenecked the normal flow of blood through arteries and veins this grave problem received special attention at cook county hospital choosing his words carefully obstetrician alfred j kobak said i do not believe the disease is necessarily increasing rather would say we see more of it because we look for it at cook county hospital when a negro patient shows clinical evidence of anemia special efforts are made to determine the presence of sickling in his red blood cells when asked if other cities were affected as much as chicago he answered that inasmuch as it was almost entirely a disease of the negro wherever a large segment of the population is nonwhite one can expect a comparable increase in the number of cases said dr kobak there is nothing in the diet of the negro which might encourage sickle cell anemia i have found it among the wealthy as well as the poor if you have the disease he warned see your doctor immediately lead a guarded life rest often make sure you have a high calorie diet together with plenty of vitamins and iron any time there are intercurrent infections such as colds see your doctor at once you are especially the kind of person who cannot take chances with any threat to your health for relief i recommend blood replacements and long periods of rest anything that tends to bolster up resistance is helpful medics have known for some time that sickle cell anemia is hereditary and not contagious but what is the latest information on the subject what is medical science doing about this dread disease in an effort to answer these  questions i visited the worldfamous medical research institute of the michael reese hospital in chicago there i interviewed dr karl singer head of the department of hematologic research where studies go on constantly in efforts to crack all the recondite mysteries within that fluid we term blood dr singer told me that sickle cell anemia is by no means a rare disease in fact he said next to leukemia it is the most prominent blood disease at the michael reese clinic alone we have about  cases under treatment all the time he estimated that there are  negroes in the united states who carry the sickle cells in their bodies fortunately not all of these people become ill there are two classes those who have the sickle cell trait and those who have the disease the first group carries the sickle cells in its blood but does not seem to suffer any ill effects the second group carries the sickle cells and suffers from the disease too dr singer estimates that a total of  to  people in this country come under the latter classification it strikes both sexes alike in the laboratories of the research institute after years of trial they have finally evolved a simple test to detect the presence of the peculiar shaped cells mixing a drop of blood with a drop of a certain chemical on a glass slide they wait a short time and then look through the microscope in from five to  minutes sickle cellsif present will appear what chance does a baby have of inheriting the disease if both parents are affected said dr singer there is a  per cent chance of each of their children being affected also what of the future dr singer drew some interesting and startling conclusions medical science has made great strides since sickle cell anemia was pointed out by dr herrick in  now a patient has a much greater chance of weathering the storms of the disease doctors are aware of the problem and medicines and knowledge are abundant crises can be anticipated and patients protected from dangerous infections men and women with sickle cell anemia formerly were forced out of the normal streams of life by their ill health their life span was short they naturally were not desirable marriage mates and so did not bear as many children as did normal healthy people women with the disease when they did have pregnancies had far less live babies than normal mothers the tendency then was for sickle cell anemia to disappear although the process was slow now however the picture is reversed doctors with antibiotics and modern knowledge of diets and general care enable these patients to live more nearly normal lives they will be living longer more of them will be marrying more of their babies will be born alive these things are all to the good but the link of heredity is an iron one whose secrets are still mostly mysteries to science sickle cells will be passed on to more and more children who will in turn grow up in increasing numbers to propagate more children it is a great public health problem it threatens to be greater in recognition of their important work and to further their studies the public health service awarded the medics at michael reese hospital a huge grant of money to finance continuing vital blood research at that institution there is a special laboratory for research in blood diseases where they are now intensifying studies in leukemia and sickle cell anemia it is hoped says dr singer that by studying these blood diseases general knowledge will accumulate which may aid in the study of many other related diseases

aving just spent a  little time in greenwood miss i felt a ¦ c  certain air of unreality  a out the march on washington the grandiose speeches the array of movie stars the big names dropped and bounced several times the sheer impress of numbersall added up technically to an occasion that one describes as thrilling and it must have been so to participants and to the millions who watched on television still while swept up in the spirit myself i wondered if to the negro citizen of greenwood itta bena and ruleville of albany americus and dawson of selma gadsden and birmingham of danville and other places it may not have seemed the most gargantuan and best organized of irrelevancies there was one relevant moment in the days events at washington that was when the youngest speaker on the platform john lewis chairman of the student nonviolent coordinating committee lashed out in anger not only at the dixiecrats but at the kennedy administration which had been successful up to that moment in directing the indignation of   people at everyone but itself the depth of lewis feeling and the direction of his attack may have baffled northern liberals mollified recently by the administrations new civil_rights bill by its bold words and by the presidents endorsement of the great march but john lewis knew because the young sncc workers in his organization are on the front lines of the conflict that while the president and the attorney general speak loud in washington their voices are scarcely whispers in the towns and the hamlets of the black belt greenwood miss just before the march revealed in its own quiet way how the deep south remains essentially untouched by resonant speeches in the national capital surrounded by cotton plantations greenwood overlooks the delta from a vantage point in westcentral mississippi it is the headquarters for the voter registration project in which all the major civilrights organizations cooperate and whose working force is supplied mainly by the youngsters of the student nonviolent coordinating committee snccaffectionately called snick it is the seat of leflore county where negroes are  per cent of the population and half the negro families have an income less than  a week almost no negroes vote and attempts of the past year to register negroes have been met with torch shotgun and a dozen varieties of official brutality intimidation and subterfuge the snick office in greenwood is like a front company headquarters during wartime as i came in one evening last august having driven from memphis i was greeted by annelle ponder whose younger sister i taught at spelman college in atlanta and whose path has crossed mine several times in the last few hectic years the ponder girls are all tall blackskinned and beautiful annelle has been in greenwood this past year handling the southern christian leadership conferences part of the voter registration project she is quiet and courageous she has been beaten by police in winona miss when friends went to the jail one day they found her sitting there her face swollen and marked barely able to speak she looked up at them and just managed to whisper one word freedom with annelle at headquarters were a bunch of the snick kids one of them came forward to shake hands and we recognized each otherit was stokely carmichael a tall slender philosophy student at howard university born in the west indies and reared in the sitin movement we had met in albany ga during the first outburst of trouble there in december i what was on for the evening a mass meeting at one of the negro churches and then a party at the home of one of the girls they showed my wife and me around the building on the first floor a big jumbled room for meetings with a long table in the center this was the dining room too for whatever voter registration workers were around when mealtime cameand a small kitchen to the side where mrs johnson cooked the meals upstairs were cubicles serving as offices and a large area with two iron cots in a corner for travelers in the movement cartons of books were on the floor they had been donated by a northern college and were soon to go on new pine bookshelves at the church meeting middleaged negroes who had lived forty and fifty years in the delta without shaking a white persons hand came up to shake hands and say hello greenwood has this past year been going through that tense hopeful process begun recently in many communities of the deep souththe first contact on an equal basis with white people an awakening to the possibility of genuine brotherhood these first white friends have been college students from new england or ministers from the middle west or just interested people passing throughrather than local whites but it is a start and among the snick youngsters manning battle  posts in the black belt have been young white southerners bob zellner from alabama sandra hayden from texas it is a beginning and credit belongs mostly to the student nonviolent coordinating committee for blasting open in various parts of the deep south the first pockets of equal interracial contact for southern whites watching at the edge of these pockets it is a painful but inexorable educational process the first reactions to the sight of negroes and whites in friendly contact are outrage fury often violence but repetition of the vision dulls the reflex and there begins not acceptance yet but at least hesitancy perhaps greenwood police this past year have begun to move into the second stage when a police car stopped my wife and me as we were driving away from the snick party they seemed at least a little accustomed to the idea they flashed their lights again and again into our faces and into the car and cast looks at the house where the lights were on and the noise of the party could still be heard they spent some time examining identification papers and then unlike a previous similar experience in atlanta where my companion was a negro and we were arrested muttered for us to move on the next afternoon a race against time began among the snick workers in the greenwood office thirteen youngsters were in parchman state prison farm and had been there for two months fortyfive other negroesmen and women of all ageshad been on the county prison farm also for two months all of them had been arrested in june on charges of breach of the peace after much legal delay release was at hand a young lawyer representing the national council of churches had come to greenwood with bond money for these fiftyeight people but it turned out that information supplied him by local officials and transcribed on the bonds was full of errors and the county attorney would not accept the bonds if the transaction could not be completed by that friday afternoon the prisoners would have to spend another weekend in jail the proper information was quickly compiled and all available typewriters and people who could type were assembled in the voter registration project office the new data were typed in the papers were taken to the sheriff just before dusk on friday the fiftyeight emerged the headquarters that night had the eerie quality of a field hospital after a battle youngsters out of jailsixteen and seventeen years oldwere sprawled here and there two of them lay on the narrow cots upstairs where a few of the snick girls dabbed their eyes with boric acid solutions some dietary deficiency in jail had affected their eyes one boy nursed an infected hand another boys foot was swollen he had started to lose feeling in it while in the hot box at parchman and had stamped on it desperately again and again to restore circulation medical attention was refused them in prison the cold newspaper reports of the past few years about people arrested in various parts of the deep south for demonstrating have never conveyed the reality of a black belt jail three snick youngsters with a tape recorder on the brokendown table near us told about their arrest and about life at parchman the first was willie rogers  it was twenty minutes to one when the chief came out of his car and across the street in front of the courthouse it was june thtuesday the chief said lm askin youall to move on we said that we were up there to get our folks registered so he said im askin youall to move on youre crowdin the sidewalkthe sidewalk was clear we walked up to the courthouse steps so as not to block the sidewalk he said im askin you to leave now we said we came to get them registered and soon as they registered we would leave so he started placing us under arrest one by one    we stayed in jail about two hours before trial came off and the judge sentenced us to four months and  fine for refusing to move on and about an hour later they came and took us to the penal farm which we stayed out on the penal farm about a week and worked    tuesday without us knowin they had sentenced us to mississippi state penitentiary parchman mississippi    two boys named john hanley and arthur jackson and ihe put us in the hot box we stayed in the hot box two nights its about five

so we stayed    we had a trial next morning we didnt have a lawyer    we stayed at the county farm four days we dug ditches in the white part of town we decided among ourselves we werent going to work or eat any more because we were afraid of being shot from a car passing the road or by one of the guards because we were all working with snick we didnt eat for two days neither worked then they came to take us to parchman there was about  policemen outside with guns and blackjacks and things standing around the bus when we came outwe all put our hands behind our heads and they searched us all put

the movement while the returned prisoners took turns lying on the bunks snick workers were being delivered to different parts of the negro section of greenwood to announce a mass meeting that night to welcome the prisoners back home you find roughly three kinds of snick workers in a place like greenwood two or three regular staff members who make  or  a weekin those weeks when there is money ten to fifteen students from various parts of the country who have left school temporarily to work with snick and who subsist on  or  perhaps every other week indeterminate numbers of young people from the town and the surrounding countryside who volunteer their time risk their lives and their liberty and get an occasional meal at headquarters i sat in on the staff meeting next morning held in the large main room in one corner was a boiler in another a rubbish can on the walls were a map of the city of greenwood newspaper clippings on civil_rights photos of pete seeger when he was in greenwood photos of jim forman executive secretary of snick scattered around were two typewriters some broken chairs books and newspapers and a big pot for koolaid but if poverty showed in the material possessions at snick headquarters the human resources were something else chairing the meeting was bob moses the quiet fighter in charge of the voter registration project a veteran by now of mississippi violence and nonviolence here was sam block silent thin dark his home deep in the delta who did the early reconnaissance for snick in the area and almost lost his life for it here was willie peacock also from mississippi another snick veteran annelle ponder was here  representing sclc martin_luther_kings group martha prescod a slender college student from the north stokely carmichael the fiery young man from howard jean wheeler a smiling coed also from howard here too was a former star student of mine at spelman collegeher home a little town in south carolinanow just graduated from yale law school marian wright with her was another graduate from yale a young white fellow named oscar chase chase recently wrote a valuable legal paper which shows how the federal government by bold imaginative use of the injunction could fulfill its responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of negroes in the deep south in the room also was another of the increasing number of white college students in this essentially negroled movementa california sociology major named mike miller who has done impressive research on civilrights matters and five of the youngsters just out of parchman jail were present that afternoon we drove in two cars to itta bena a feudal cotton village outside greenwood where negroes came off the land to meet in a dilapidated little church welcome back the parchman prisoners and sing freedom songs with an overpowering spirit one of the returned prisoners was mother perkins fragile and small seventyfive years old who had just spent like the rest two months on the county prison farm for wanting to register cars filled with white men rumbled by along the road that passed by the church door but the meeting and the singing went on anyone who felt the urge got up and spoke an old man rose on his cane and said all these years going along behind my plow i thought some day things would change but i never dreamed id see it now bob moses told them that negroesand whiteswere without jobs in all the big cities of the nation that they could not run away any more from the delta to chicago and detroit that they must stay and wrench from the state of mississippi what they deserved as human beings marian wright told them a fable about an eagle that for a long time was told it was a chicken and believed it stokely carmichael reminded them that while the lord might be on their side they would have to secure their rights by their own intense efforts meanwhile the automobiles kept passing on the road outside the crushing conclusion that comes out of greenwood miss and selma ala and danville va and americus gais that the federal government is but a shadow in the hardrock places of the deep south standing at the foot of the lincoln memorial john lewis turned his wrath not at the easy target the dixiecrats but against the administration it is the federal government that indicted nine of our people in albany the democratic party lewis made clear cannot be treated as a savior as long as it lives with eastland nor can the republicans harboring goldwater what political leader can stand up and say his party is the party of freedom and then the most dangerous question one can ask in a country boasting of its twoparty system where is our party to many the march had been presented as a gigantic lobby for the administrations civil_rights bill but lewis pointed quickly unerringly to the weaknesses in the bill furthermore by sponsoring a new civilrights bill the administration had skillfully turned attention to congress and deflected the erratic spotlight of the civilrights movement from possibly focusing on inadequacies of the executive the straight crass fact at which john lewis was aiming is this the national government without any new legislation has the power to protect negro voters and demonstrators from policemens clubs hoses and jailsand it has not used that power despite the welcome new words of concern by the kennedy administration despite several dozen suits filed by the justice department in voting cases the negro in the deep south still stands alone and unprotected as he tries to eat in a bus terminal register to vote or hand out a leaflet on a street corner the right to vote and freedom of expression are not in themselves solutions to the fundamental  problem which is a rearranging of economic and political power in the south but they are prerequisites to that rearrangement there is a constitutional rock to which the executive branch can tie its lines and then smash with all the pover at its command every wallace every barnett every chief pritchett every commander lingo every bull connor who ever begins to lift a billy club at an american citizen exercising his constitutional rights that is the supreme courts statement in the debs case of  the entire strength of the nation may be used to enforce in any part of the land the full and free exercise of all national powers and the security of all rights entrusted by the constitution to its care but to act on that dictum calls for certain traits which the administration has thus far not shown imaginativeness in the use of the courts boldness in the exercise of executive power the courage to set new precedents in federal relations the willingness to bypass congress on an issue about which congress spoke its mind in when it passed the fourteenth amendment above all it means changing to the offensive up to now the administration has simply reacted to every racial crisis southern officials have thrown thousands of people into jail and then put the burden on the civilrights movement to get them out the national  government needs to act and then put the burden on southern segregationists to revoke the action let them wrestle with courts raise money for trial plead for toleration the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment the supreme courts statement in the debs case the declaration of section  of the us penal code that any official who deprives a person of his constitutional rights has committed a federal crime these are the alreadyexisting legal bases for executive action that action requires first stationing all over the south hundreds of federal agents replacing the fbi which is incompetent in the field of civil_rights to protect the constitutional rights of negroes these agents would have the specific assignment and the authority granted by the president to jail any local official who violates the constitution at the same time the president must begin fillingas he has failed to do so farthe federal judgeships of the deep south with persons committed to the principle of equality regardless of the wishes of the regions senators among the outworn political institutions of this nation is that of senatorial courtesy which requires kennedy to consult eastland in the appointment of a federal judge in mississippi talmadge and russell in georgia the shattering of precedent can start here then a combination of quickacting federal agents and determined judges can begin to rivet into the mind of the deep south and into the mind of the nation not that negroes are equal that will take time but that if they are not treated equally the consequences will be swift and harsh when ten core and sncc people white and negro walked into alabama to try to establish what bill moore at the cost of his life had failed to establishthe right to walk safely on a public highwaya cordon of federal marshals should have surrounded them and when alabama safety director a lingo showed up with his electric prod poles and guns he should have been taken immediately into federal custody the burden of legal proof needs to be borne by the segregationists and this has not yet been done any good lawyer knows that the advantage is in the hands of the man who moves first that delay and bureaucracy and legal complications all work against those who are trying to undo an action yet the civilrights movement which cannot help it and the justice department which can have been on the defensive the needed initiative is not likely to come from a government whose dedication to racial equality is as circumspect as that of the kennedy brothers it took a series of explosive crises throughout the nation to force from them words of moral concern that became part of the constitution a hundred years ago it took something close to a revolution to bring forth a moderate civilrights bill which will be further moderated by congress and by segregationists federal judges and by a cautious justice department basic changes are needed in the social structure of the nation before meaningful racial equality can be established but in the deep south a prerequisite for such changes is the establishment of the right to vote to organize to speak write and assemble freely and without fear of violence that requires a radical new use of initiative and power by the national government and because the administration and inherently any administration lacks the internal motivation for such a seizure of initiative it will have to be prodded by the increased use of nonviolent direct action right now those who see this most clearly feel it most intensely and are best prepared to move on it are the young people in the student nonviolent coordinating committee 
a centennial evaluation
by rayford w logan
he evaluation of the promise of emancipation like that of other promissory notes must calculate the intent of the signer the consideration expected of or given by the promisees the face and hidden values the added dividends and finally the payments by the promisees and the balance due them the most important controversy concerning lincolns intent in emancipating the slaves stems from his answer to an editorial by horace greeley in the new york tribune august   greeley had chided the president for his alleged failure fully to execute the terms of the second confiscation act june   which declared that the slaves of any person convicted of treason should go free on august  lincoln wrote to greeley i would save the union i would save it the shortest way under the constitution the sooner the national authority can be restored the nearer the union will be the union it was if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time save slavery i do not agree with them if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery i do not agree with them my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save this union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union i shall do less whenever i shall believe what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views i have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty and i intend no modification of my oftexpressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free those who gleefully quote this negro digest december  letter in their efforts to prove that lincoln did not at that time plan to square his personal wish with his official duty overlook convincing evidence that he had already resolved in his own mind this dilemma early in july  lincoln had already begun to compose the first draft of an emancipation proclamation on july  he made known to two members of his cabinet his intention to prepare the draft on july  almost a month before greeleys editorial the president submitted to his cabinet a tentative draft of an emancipation proclamation lincoln wisely delayed publication of this preliminary emancipation proclamation until a union victory would discredit partially at least those who asserted that the abolition of slavery in the rebel states was dictated by the need to enlist the former slaves against their former masters the union forces achieved a sufficient victory on september  at antietam sharpsburg md and compelled the confederates to retreat across the potomac five days later lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation it stated that on january   all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforward and forever free since the southern states rejected this olive branch of september   lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation on january   the proclamation made two promises first that the slaves in the states and parts of states in rebellion against the united states should be then thenceforward and forever free second that former slaves would be used as garrison troops and on naval vessels against their former masters and thus would have the right and responsibility to fight for their own freedom in the legal sense this military service was not a consideration not a quid pro quo for emancipation lincoln did not require nor had the slaves offered this service in return for emancipation but free negroes not only leaders like frederick douglass but also the rank and file interpreted it as a consideration they had previously encountered inertia legal and political obstacles and evasion when they had sought to enlist after january   they so insistently demanded the right to fight for freedom that less than four weeks after the proclamation secretary of war stanton authorized governor john a andrew of massachusetts to enlist negro volunteers these northern negroes were fighting not only for the physical emancipation of slaves in the south they were fighting for their own freedom which an ultimate confederate victorystill not impossible at the beginning of  would have jeopardized negroes thus interpreted the emancipation proclamation as a right and responsibility to share  with other americans in the quest for freedom this was not a new interpretation negroes had helped to preserve the freedom of colonists from attacks by indians and frenchmen crispus attucks had been the first to fall in the socalled boston massacre despite initial opposition free and slave negroes had fought and died in the battles of the revolutionary war from bunker hill to yorktown negro sailors under perry at putinbay and soldiers in jacksons army at new orleans had contributed to victory in the second war for independence the war of  a small number had helped to liberate from mexican rule california and the territories of new  mexico and utah the acquisition of which had precipitated the renewal of the issue of slavery or freedom in all the territories the emancipation proclamation therefore gave negroes a right and responsibility to do for themselves what they had long done for others other values than this right and responsibility were less evident on january   one was the promise of freedom to negroes in haiti and liberia from ostracism by the family of nations though this promise was hidden i believe that there was a clear reciprocal relationship between the emancipation of american negro slaves and lincolns recognition of haiti and liberia let us return to the crucial year  on june  congress passed a law abolishing slavery in all the other territories when lincoln signed this bill he had achieved a goal the pursuit of which at one time had threatened to destroy his political career abolition of slavery in the territories had constituted one of the main themes of his house divided speech at springfield illinois june   the month of june  witnessed another triumph for lincoln on june  he signed the bill for the appointment of the first diplomatic representative of the united states to haiti to be sure this victory over the slaveholders and their northern allies had not tormented lincoln during his lonely watches at night as excruciatingly as had the question of slavery in the territories but opposition to the recognition of haiti had antedated opposition to the suppression of the african slave trade and the most bitter debates over the right of congress to abolish slavery in the territories since emancipation in the border states emancipation in the district of columbia the acknowledgment of the independence of haiti and liberiaand i would add the treaty for the suppression of the african slave trade as well as the law abolishing slavery in all the territoriesindicated lincolns purpose to carry forward in sumners words the principles of the declaration of independence the emancipation proclamation gave further evidence of this purpose one of the greatest constitutional lawyers from john marshall to john marshall harlan the farseeing nineteenthcentury dissenter lincoln realized that the legality of the emancipation proclamation would be challenged he therefore prodded the republican national convention of  and congress until the latter voted in  to send to the states a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery throughout the united states the job was of course not ended even after the ratification of the thirteenth amendment the southern states adopted new black codes designed to circumvent the amendment none of them gave the freedmen the right to vote the restoration of white control in the south after  led douglass to remark in  that he had long regarded the elective franchise as the one great power by which all other civil_rights are obtained douglasss initial fears were so compounded that by the time of his death in  the promise of emancipation seemed almost an empty dream the ratification of the fourteenth amendment  of the fifteenth amendment  and the passage of the civil_rights act  temporarily revived hopes of cynical and sanguine observers but the civil_rights decision  which limited the application of the fourteenth amendment to states disillusioned them negroes suffered another cruel blow in december  on the twentysecond henry w grady delivered at delmonicos in new york city his famous oration the new south flagrantly distorting conditions in the former confederate states he gave the assurance that the south could be depended up to treat the negro equitably his audience of some  of the most prominent and powerful northern business men magazine and newspaper editors and former union generals frequently applauded him and gave him a standing ovation at the end of his mellifluous address a band played  way down south in dixie although the northern press did not accord the orator the almost unstinted praise which subsequent mythology has bestowed upon grady many northern editors naively greeted enthusiastically this milestone on the road to reunion as an invitation to expand their investments in what was still in large measure the old south booker t washington embellished the myth of the new south in his equally famous and more effective address at atlanta georgia on september   washington had less excuse than did grady for this continuation of the myth in fact washington had previously excoriated the myth in an address to the womens new england club of boston january   washington condemned the sharecropping system more vehemently than frederick douglass had done  years earlier in an  address to the american social science association washington pointed out that schools for negroes were kept open only three and a half months in the rural areas of alabama he flatly contradicted grady and stated that railway accommodations in the south for negroes were inferior to those for whites washington went further and accused grady of not telling the truth about the new south here are washingtons exact words it would have been the simple truth if mr grady had said that in the whole of georgia and alabama and other southern states not a negro juror is allowed to sit in the jury box and while on that subject mr grady might have added even at the risk of spoiling his rhetoric the information that since freedom there have been at least  colored men in the south murdered by white men and yet with perhaps a single exception the record of no court shows that a single white man has been hanged for these murders if time would admit an analysis of mr gradys speech i would reveal other equally untrue statements washington did take time later in this speech to state that southern white men privately admitted that they kept the negro vote from being counted whenever that vote might have a controlling influence in an election the next year  confirmed washingtons reference in this speech to the disenfranchisement of negroes mississippi adopted the first constitutional amendment in the postreconstruction period for the express purpose of preventing large numbers of negroes from voting and of allowing equally unqualified whites to vote what then is the explanation for washingtons apostasy at atlanta on september   when he concluded his address with a prayer to god that a determination to administer absolute justice coupled with material prosperity will bring into our beloved south a new heaven and a new earth was he as cynical as henry iv of france had been when he justified his apostasy with the famous remark paris vaut bien une messe henry iv became a catholic in order to gain control of france washington became an admirer of the new south in order to gain control of negro leadership how fortunate it was for frederick douglass that the great abolitionist and advocate of equal rights for negroes had died seven months before washingtons vain attempt to salvage as much of the promise of emancipation as he could but there were negroes in the audience at atlanta who understood as douglass probably would have understood the blow that washington had delivered to the promise james creelman a well known reporter of the new york world observed that at the end of the speech most of the negroes in the audience were crying perhaps without knowing just why washington was later moved perhaps to tears also at the same time that he was delivering his compromise address south carolina was preparing its constitutional amendment to disenfranchise and disfranchise negroes in  the united states supreme court for the first time sanctioned the principle of separate but equal accommodations mckinley in his inaugural address  made a donothing promise which should have warned washington that he could not rely upon the new south the white house the supreme court or congress for the protection of negroes civil_rights mckinley promised it will be my constant aim to do nothing and permit nothing to be done that will arrest or disturb this growing sentiment of unity and cooperation this revival of esteem and affiliation which now animates so many thousands in both the old antagonistic sections but i shall cheerfully do everything possible to promote and increase it the decline of the populist movement the gradual disappearance of negroes from southern state legislatures the valedictory in  of george h white the last negro of the postreconstruction era in the house of representatives the continued disfranchisement by southern states of negroes the lynching of almost  negroes a year the inequitable allotment of public school funds led booker t washington as early as  to express publicly his disillusionment at the same time leading northern magazines and newspapers continued to lampoon negroes congress refused to enforce the second section of the fourteenth amendment which required a reduction in the number of representatives to which a state was entitled if it denied the right to vote for any reason except for participation in rebellion or other crimes the federal government refused to enact new laws or to enforce the remnants of the reconstruction laws to protect the civil_rights of negroes for these reasons i have called the beginning of the twentieth century the nadir the lowest point in the fulfillment of the promise of emancipation but in august  william edward burghardt du bois born in the year when the fourteenth amendment was added to the constitution refused to accept the virtual nullification of the promise of emancipation at the second meeting of the niagara movement this one at harpers ferry he stoutly asserted we shall not be satisfied to take one jot or tittle less than our full manhood rights we claim for ourselves every single right that belong to a freeborn american political civil and social and until we get these rights we will never cease to protest and assail the ears of america du bois thus gave a new meaning to the declaration of  independence the emancipation proclamation the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments in  a white mob ran amok in springfield illinois the only city in which lincoln had owned a home william english walling sounded a new call to arms in his article race war in the north in the independent september   either the spirit of the abolitionists of lincoln and lovejoy must be revived and we must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and social equality or vardaman and tillman will soon have transferred the race war to the north the stouthearted declaration of du bois at harpers ferry in  the scene of john browns raid in  had not aroused the conscience of many americans white or negro but the mob in springfield illinois  had in a paraphrase of the memorable words of talleyrand about one of bonapartes mistakes committed worse than a crime it had committed a blunder the mob startled the ideological heirs of the abolitionists oswald garrison villard a grandson of william lloyd garrison drafted the call for a meeting on the centennial of lincolns birthday the signers of the call eminent men and women negro and white protestants jews catholics and freethinkers signed the call in the course of organizing a more perfect union of the neoabolitionists the leaders held an open meeting at cooper union may  in new york city where abraham lincoln had delivered one of the most effective addresses of his career an address which in the opinion of many historians won the support of the east for the homely uncouth railsplitters candidacy for the presidency of the united states in may  there was organized the permanent body to be known as the national association for the advancement of colored people the first president was moorfield storey who had learned his abolitionist principles from charles sumner oswald garrison villard was the disbursing treasurer du bois the only negro official at that time was director of publicity and research what a colossal blunder the springfield mob had committed du bois moved from atlanta to new york and in the pages of the crisis castigated the conscience of america he also started a new generation of heirs to garrison douglass and lincoln whatever one may think of du bois today his earlier role of winning disciples to his harpers ferry declaration places him in the forefront of the neoabolitionists who have participated in the new quest for the fulfillment of the promise of emancipation after the formation of the naacp in  and soon thereafter of the national urban league the low rugged plateau began to merge into hills and then into peaks from which one could view the promised land the role of the naacp of the nul of the association for the study of negro life and history of negro newspapers churches schools writers artists athletes participants in sitins freedom rides and of white organizations and individuals constitutes a glorious chapter in the history of the united states this chapter can not be written here but its chronology destroys a myth which i have recently heard in the united states europe latin america and even in africa according to this myth negroes began definitely to move toward the promised land since and as a result of the cold war with the soviet union now the cold war began in   years after the formal organization of the naacp and of the national urban league  years after the supreme court declared peonage unconstitutional  years after the court declared the grandfather clause unconstitutional  years after the court ruled that state laws permitting residential segregation were unconstitutional it would be an act of supererogation to list other decisions in which the court prior to  almost unremittingly ruled in favor of the civil_rights of negroes six years before the beginning of the cold war president franklin d roosevelt signed executive order  which popularized the concept of nondiscrimination on account of race color religion or national origin in  the state of new york enacted the first state law containing this new promise of emancipation it is on the other hand true that the cold war accelerated action by government organizations and private individuals as early as may   acting secretary of state dean acheson had written to the fair employment practice committee i think it is quite obvious    that the existence of discriminations against minority groups in the united states is a handicap in our relations with other countries the department of state therefore has good reason to hope for the continued and increased effectiveness of public and private efforts to do away with these discriminations and president trumans committee on civil_rights added in its report to secure these rights  the united states is not so strong the final triumph of the democratic ideals is not so inevitable that we can ignore what the world thinks of our record but i submit that the momentum gained before  accelerated action without going so far as do mechanistic philosophers of history i believe to a certain degree in the rhythm of social change a rhythm which was increasing in tempo prior to  and on the whole still continues
