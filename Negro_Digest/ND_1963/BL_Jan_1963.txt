negro youth
by dr ralph j bunche
have no mandate to i f speak on behalf of any one but myself but i know what i who have been for  years an american of negro ancestry want and how i feel i do not doubt that my wants and feelings are fairly representative of those of most of my race i want to be a man on the same basis and level as any white citizeni want to be as free as the whitest citizen i want to exercise and in full the same rights as the white american i want to be eligible for employment exclusively on the basis of my skills and employability and for housing solely on my capacity to pay i want to have the same privileges the same treatment in public places as every other person but this should not be read by anyone to mean that i want to be white or that i am pushy seeking to go where i am not wanted far from it i am as proud of my origin ancestors and race as anyone could be indeed i resent nothing more than a racial slur or stigma i want to go and to do only where and what all americans are entitled to go and to do this i think is what every american negro feels it may be expressed in polite eloquence by some in bitterness or even outright belligerence by others it may cause some just to break out and start to knock things around but in each case the emotion is sound and urgent and american i believe i could readily understand and accept this if i were not a negro if i were white i can never really understand why the white man whether from south or north seems to find it difficult to do so i am not sure that he does it is possible that deep down in his heart he knows that the negro cause is right and just that i think may explain why there is so much less of racial tension in southern and northern communities today than there was a quarter century ago despite the fact that the negro is bolder and more demanding and that the walls of segregation have been often breached why raceriots do not occur why ku klux klansmen now just meekly hand out leaflets i cannot understand how anyone claiming to be a good american can condone the denial of these elementals of democracy to any other american how can anyone be so manifestly against the very essence of americanismnot to mention fairness and decencyand at the same time purport to be fighting communism while thus giving to the communists the strongest weapon they have against us negro citizens may be pardoned for expecting their white fellow citizens to be at least consistent the logic and the evidence are all against the racebaiting bitterenders it is so obvious that no one can miss it that the south at it has reluctantly lowered some of its racial bars is better offpolitically economically and culturally than it has ever been the greatest resource of any community state or nation is its people and it is recklessly shortsighted to waste that resource as the south and to only lesser extent the north has been doing for so long depriving the negro worker of fair employment costs the nation dearly in lost manhours production consumption and taxes i suppose i speak with an unavoidable bias but i feel that if i were a white citizen in the south today i would look at my black or brown brother and say to myself what responsibility do i share for the crime that has been perpetrated not alone against this individual but against the community and the nation what have i contributed to the degradation of this fellow american who except for a sheer accident of birth could be me or my brother what can i do to rectify an injustice to the individual and a loss to the nation this being youth night i really should close on a word especially for youth although i do not care very much for distinctions among people even on the basis of age white or black old or young the real test comes in what you have done or can do in a competitive world you must rise to meet the competition that means preparation it also means building up confidence on the basis of demonstrated performance in connection with preparation the school dropout figures for negro youth are alarming it is an exciting and inspiring world to be in and although there are great dangers in it much tension and cause for worry it affords vast opportunitygreater i think for youth black as well as white than has ever been known ours is a great country great not only in its physical resources and technological capacity but also in its ideals and its political structure and in its ability to admit its faults openly and try to do something about them that is the case with our problemthe negro problem it is after all a credit to the virility and fidelity of our system that a minority group such as ours can carry on a successful struggle for its rights there are unhappily not very many countries in the world today where this can be done i think that democracy is the very best way of life we have an obligation as citizens to make it work here as it is supposed to work in doing that we are helping the nation as well as ourselves it seems to me that in our concern with the threat of communism we do not do justice to our own system we permit communism to become an obsession with us and force us into a defensive and negative posture my concern is with democracy not communism i believe that the best counter to the threat of any ism is never to be obsessed by it and to concentrate on making our own far superior system of democracy work up to the maximum of its potentiality we can never afford to be complacent but i see the outlook as good for us the outcome is certainthe negro citizen will one day walk in this society without stigma the naacp firmly dedicated to our advancement and always in the forefront of our struggle affords unfailing leadership in that struggle it merits the unqualified gratitude of every negro indeed of everyone who loves democracy and decency the negro who does not support the naacp is selling his own future short the naacp will i am sure be flexible enough in its program and approaches to deal with all situations it will develop new tactics to meet new needs i have some concern about a growing tendency toward a proliferation of organizations working in the civil_rights field we can only weaken our effort by an excessive diffusion of our limited resources of leadership and finance i may say also that i have always been disappointed about the membership roll of the naacp since most negroes ardently wish that we strive for most negroes ought to be members of the organization the naacp should have a mass base it should boast millions of members and much more ought to be done toward that end increasingly u s public opinion rallies to our cause the principles and objectives of the un support us most of the world is behind us we can and will eliminate this moral shame from the nation finally i would say to every young negro dont ever lower your sights dont let the fiction of race impair your vision or narrow your horizon of hope never think in terms of limitationsthere need be none at least none that you cannot overcome resolve to do what you aspire to do and eliminate the racial factor in your calculation train for what you want to do break into it face it with confidence and above all defend your dignity as men and women with all you have 
a strange kind of love
by lillian smith 
speaks in the rebel of a kind of love sists on changing mens lives a love complex critical and often reacted to with hatea love which sometimes turns itself into hate when the rebel does not understand his rebellion you cannot come close to the present nonviolent movement in the south without feeling this strange love it warmsand it burns it reveals mens depthsand heights it appeals to their compassion down with jin cm and it stirs their hate it is conciliatingand it is adamant it is a powerful thing men do not always behave creatively in its presence gandhi knew wellno one knew betterthe potency and the i dangers of the nonviolent way of  bringing about change the ritual istic acting out of the need for change and no one has used this way more successfully one reason for his successthere were others lay in his stern refusal to let his followers forget the seductive ease  with which their own natures could misuse this ritualistic weapon he warned them that regardless of selfdiscipline or the righteousness of their cause or the desire not to harbor resentment in the act of protest itself lies dormant violence it does not followhis life made this plainthat protest should not occur nor that men have devised a better or more effective way to bring about change than by the use of the nonviolent protest among enlightened southerners there is today more argument about this than about segregation itself few approve openly of martin_luther_king the moderates who are amenable to slow change angrily protest the negroes use of this method even those who have been active for full desegregation of public facilities and hundreds of thousands of whites are seem to feel a curious resentment toward these nonviolent ritualsor is it an undefined fear however we name it many of our best people are attacking the nonviolent methods and philosophy which the students and dr_kings group are using it is of these that i write for they  are now the makers of public opinion the day of the rabid segregationists the obscene demagogues is overas recent elections in georgia have shown mississippi is just beginning its ordeal and at present there is little likelihood that leadership will arise there bold enough to free the people quickly from their servitude to the past the problem is the old one of states rights vs human rights it is clarified as a matter of constitutional law for governor barnett is defying the federal courts he has failed in his attempt to interpose this state between young meredith and the highest court of the land every thoughtful american knows his attempt had to fail it is as simple as that as citizens of the usa we owe the highest court our obedience mississippians are not exempt whatever we may think of the law it must be obeyed as it is interpreted by the supreme court the president was of course compelled to see that obedience was given what price mississippians will pay for their defiance we do not know it is possible that the oxford ordeal will have the final effect of clearing their minds of the myths and fantasies which the demagogues have for so long substituted for the truth there is in much of the south however a more benevolent flexible mood then why this angry resentment of martin_luther_king and the sitin students it is not segregation we are defending an albany citizen wrote me we were going to accept desegregation of schools quietly at least a token desegregationuntil these negroes started demanding things now look at the anger in our town is it right to break laws as a protest should young negroes be encouraged to go to jail shouldnt they be taught instead to be respectable whether or not albany would accept without resentment any kind of desegregation is highly problematical but it is true that its citizens voted against the demagogue griffin and for the more moderate sanders for governor the letter just quoted from was written by a highly intelligent woman who has often spoken out against segregation now she is confusedand she says her liberal friends are you can remind them there may be a specious tinge in their insistence that negroes obey local statutes when our officials many of our congressmen and many business men have urged the whites not to obey the directives of the supreme court you can remind them that in countries distant from us we call young men who fight for their freedom heroes not jail birds even though they are thrown into prison but we miss the point by indulging in such epicyclic arguments the reason for this moral and mental confusion lies not in the rational part of minds but closer to the mythical much of it is down where stereotypes are made for nearly a century we southerners have stereotyped not only the negro but ourselves we now find it difficult to see ourselves or negroes as complex human beings each with varying gifts and differences and all with the same civil_rights instead we see ourselves as nice people who if not pushed too hard will give negroes a bag of goodies now and then we see ourselves graciously handing them little bits of their rights which are not ours to hand doling them out as we or our grandfathers used to dole out fat bacon and sweets and cornmeal at christmas we see ourselves shimmering in an aura of kindness we feel goodhearted and often gently tender as we give our little presents but they are not ours to giveah this is what hurts the negroes are reminding us their rights are not ours to give as we see fit but theirsgiven them as human rights by god and as civil_rights by the u s constitution what hurts is watching this nice image of ourselves crumble to dust for as the negroes sit in or picket or quietly stand in front of city hall asking for a conference with the mayor or the city council they are not begging nor bowing and scraping they are with dignity and selfdiscipline asking for what is theirs and asking for it now and suddenly the stereotypes we have made of them and of us collide and clash and break into splinters we feel nakedly exposed as we stare at our real selves and stunned as we stare at them these are not nice negroes who are satisfied with things as they are but human beings wanting for themselves and their children the right to grow to learn to question to become to feel secure in their home towns and as we glimpse ourselves we see something queasily dishonest which we cannot bear to acknowledge how can we be so proud of our kindnesses to the few negroes we know when we have stubbornly kept from all negroes their civil_rightsrights that are as much theirs as our civil_rights are ours let me say at once the personal kindnesses shown by white individuals to negroes the compassion revealed in thousands of small deeds the sacrificial acts the risking of their lives now and then by whites who have loathed the white supremacy systemand there have been always from civil war days thousands who didare the most precious part of our southern cultur in spite of demagogues in spite of restrictions which have bitten as deep into our lives as into negroes lives many white southerners have been gentle kind and have maintained relationships of genuine quality with negro individuals i say quickly too that i want no world where only civil_rights are observedhowever fairly they are observed we need both our rights and the mercy of others we cannot live as human beings in a world without grace right here is the  fatal flaw in communism which theoretically says mercy grace and generosity in human relations are not needed but neither can men live as men without their civil_rights there is no eitheror there must be both and dramatically though quietly the gestures words and ritualistic acts of the nonviolent protesters have brought this home to us brought it with the same kindness and grace a few white individuals through the troubled decades have shown to them i am willing to say that had there not been those good and valid personal relationships through the last century a nonviolent movement could not have drawn negroes to its philosophy they would have found it too hard to forgive but there is another cause for the resentment of methods used by the nonviolent group many suffer a severe psychic difficulty in dealing with this strange love compassion from someone you consider beneath you or whom you have harmed enrages youif you are easily enrageda forgiving spirit in a negro can as one man said to me make you want to tear him to pieces what is he forgiving me for what have  done things boil inside guilt chokes kindness arrogance claws at fairness the truth is that we can meet nonviolence creatively only if we respect nonviolence we can relate to compassion only if somewhere in us there exists a little compassion we can give justice only if we value justice we can respond to humor in some of these situations only if we value humor the nonviolent philosophy is a catalyst powerful and difficult in its spiritual demands and there is something else it is human not to want to be put in a position where we act or despise ourselves for not acting the negroes nonviolent protests bring to a town its moment of truth we can no longer slide along complacently we are compelled to make decisions right or wrong suppose for instance you walk into a drug store where negro students are sittingin at the lunch counter there they are quietly sitting on the stools usually reading school books sometimes the bible you watch suddenly white hoodlums edge in one slaps a student another sticks a burning cigarette in a black the students do not move every muscle in you aches to help these students and yet you do nothing you would tackle the hoodlums maybe but you tell yourself you might start a riot and you might and suddenly you are sick with guilt how can you stand there then as suddenly anger overcomes your guilt and you yell silently to the students fight back but the nonviolent protesters just sit there taking the blows taking the burning cigarette now something else happens inside you a nasty indecent something whispers ok cowards let the hoodlums use the chain on you see if i care you walk out you have not done or said  a thing but you are sick all over for you do care what happens you cant help but care and suddenly you are raging mad with yourself and with the hoodlums and with the students and you settle the stinging turmoil inside you by saying it is these negroes who are disturbing the peace of our town things were fineuntil they came or maybe you are a prominent businessman sitting in your office trying to make a profitable deal for your firmand beyond you is this spiritual turmoil this challenge you know it concerns you and your children but there is this deal to pull offso you turn your moment of truth over to the chief of police and tell him to handle those negroes who are disturbing the peace whose peace yours the hoodlums they have certainly disturbed something in your townbut not its peace only its apathy itsr complacency its paralysis in the face of a changing whirling world that wont wait no matter how loudly we americans south or north beg it to wait and they have mixed up your values they have disturbed your peace of soul and mindfor we have not measured up to the moral challenge offered us the biggest that will be offered us in our lifetime and now    and now we are touching a sensitive thing hard to grasp firmly and bring up for eyes to look at segregation itself what has this way of life done to us all have we whites by its terrible logic changed from human beings into hollow men where is our virtue our excellence did we trade it for white superiority have we in this cultural nightmare turned into the stereotype we made of the negros soul is it we who are satisfied with things as they are is it we who are apathetic and without courage to speak up for the rights of our own and other children to grow and become where is the hollowness we thought we had made when in stereotyping the negro we scooped out his love of freedom his spiritual dignity his hope is it now inside our own souls did we think we could dehumanize the negro without dehumanizing ourselves and now we are touching something else the dynamic quality of change itself how can we change the southern way of life without changing ourselves without learning to think with honest logic the nonviolent movement is telling us by its philosophy and its ritualistic acts that change comes not only by a few external acts but by a great many internal acts it is forcing us although its leaders may be only dimly aware of itinto embarking on an orphic journey it is compelling us to seek the hidden poetic truth in this tumultuous agony to reach deep into our hell and grasp eurydice by our questions and lure her close enough to our hearts to feel her once more this movement not by its nonviolent methods but by the reiteration of those  powerful words love compassion redemption grace is compelling us to search for truth that of our region and of ourselves their radiating power reminds us that we must find a new way of relating ourselves not only to each other but to reality itself to the times we live in to ultimate concerns and some of us had thought we could skin out of the dark bitter past without even admitting we had done wrong we had thought a little token desegregation would rub out a century of our calendar of sins how simple minded and how blank we have been the black muslimsgrowing steadily in power and influence are telling negros to beware the nonviolent movement those negroes and that martin_luther_king are actually forgiving white folks for centuries of sins they are appeasers ready to settle for integration well we are not we want black supremacy and are going to get it someday well make the whites pay for their sins but the whites are not listening to the black muslims they are resenting wasting precious time resenting the firm quiet offers made by dr_king and the students and other leaders to reason together and work things out the nonviolent protesters are demanding their rights yes but at the same time they are offering us not black supremacy not a black kkk not black mobs but gifts of good will conciliation forgiveness they dont want to take our rights away as do the black muslims they only want theirs but the big story which many are missing is that now has come their time to heal broken relationships to give presents of mutual forgiveness and a mutual bearing of spiritual burdens this arouses in some not warmth not gratitude not awe but anxiety they find this strange love offered us this passion for our common welfare and common future extremely disturbing one man said this let the black muslims come i prefer them to these damned nonviolent niggers i know what to do with a black muslim but what does one do when offered forgiveness and love this means weve gotta straighten things out as one white put it and how hard this now seems to people who had convinced themselves that a little token desegregation would do it then business could go on as usual art could go on as usual philosophy religion could go on as usual politics    and nownow we know better a man must accept limits to his rebellion as camus so wisely said whether it is rebellion against the past or the future if the word moderation has any meaning left in it after its misuse for the past decade it lies in this necessity to accept limits the nonviolent group has done so its members exclude physical violence and verbal arrogance they exclude resentment they try never to refuse a chance for conciliating talks but they put no limit on each individuals capacity for forgiveness no limit on compassion no limit on willingness to help bear the white mans psychic burdens this is in effect a tremendous spiritual challenge to white southernersone many of us are unable to rise to at present these acts these wordshow are we to answer where have we put the limits to our rebellion against change are limits set only against mobs terrorists arsonists demagogues only against the closing of our schools have we set limits to our arrogance our hubris our complacency our refusal to see what the future demands of us can we meet compassion with compassion justice with justice reconciliation with reconciliation there can be no limits to love it must be and is durable and longlasting there can be no limits to honor and justice and mercy only a profound humility can say we have done wrong and are even now doing wrong it requires character to be humble character to accept this strange love offered by negroes to help us bear the burdens of our common future and our common fears this strange love is the essence of the christian religion its roots go deep into the jewish religion it is what valid religion is about that superb writer charles williams now dead but well remembered in england a friend of t s eliot and c s lewis speaks in his essays  and novels more clearly than any contemporary writer of the love that says let me bear your fear for you you can then do what you need to do let me ease you of your anxiety i cannot do your work this you must do but i can bear your fear and though the leaders of the nonviolent movement have not used these words they in their ritualistic acts and their conciliating talk are saying to the white south you have no need to fear revenge or malice from us all we ask is that you let us help bear the fears you have for the future all we want is to help meet that future with courageand with grace but many whites turn away saying they make mistakes too they are not always forgiving some of their leaders do foolish things of course they do some of their leaders have not as yet made their own orphic journey others commit tactical errors a few are not spiritually concerned enough for this ordeal some of the college kids are thinking more about their rights than they are of what they will do with these rights some of the young northern whites in the movement feel more anger toward white southerners than compassion though all are courageous this is true and because they have undertaken a rigorous vocation they must demand all that is possible of themselves or get out of the movement but all groups all movements even saints come short of perfection what this group is saying to the south and the nation is worth listening to worth reaching out for let us stifle our angry shouts and try to hear the small voice that is speaking to us it is possible this philosophy these conciliating nonviolent acts may save us even though some say we dont deserve saving from the eye for an eye the tooth for a tooth rage of those black supremacists who have succumbed to a ravening hunger for revenge if we listen in time

ater on this year or maybe even now your local newspaper will run an ad similar to this one wanted  to  men to harvest vegetables apples or what have you apply your local employment office i like many unemployed boys decided to look into this i went to my local employment office to get more information on the subject i was told that this place was in upstate new york you would get fiftycents for every bushel of stringbeans picked and that the transportation would be free a bus would be leaving the employment office at  oclock that friday morning that nice sleeping quarters would be at your disposal providing you brought your own blankets and sheets oh it sounded good i figured that i could pick at least  bushels a day but i was in for a surprise as i was later to find out i rushed home and told mom and dad about it dad admitted that it sounded good and since the employment office seemed to have all the statistics about it he assumed that it was ok but mom was against it for she had heard that such trips only ended in hardships dad and i finally persuaded her to let me go some friends of mine were also going i packed  my luggage and could hardly wait until friday came friday finally came and we went to the employment office the bus was already there a shagglylooking bus with florida plates the driver and his two companions were sloppily dressed and had the smell of alcohol about them the man that had interviewed us earlier called our names from a long list as we boarded the bus as we rode off i noticed that the bus was filthy dirt at least two inches thick was on the floor with an assortment of wine and sodapop bottles here we were about thirtyfive of us all going to what we thought would be a little easy money we rode all morning and half the afternoon before we finally stopped at a service station and ate we had brought lunches i was glad to get off that stuffy bus and stretch my legs we stayed at the service station for about an hour and we were off again we had gone no more than three miles when i heard this rumbling noise from what seemed to be the motor the bus stopped and the driver got out and looked at the motor and other parts he discovered that the drive shaft had broken all of us got off the bus and sat down on the side of the road the driver hitched a ride to the nearest town to try and get the part repaired it was just about dark when he returned with the disappointing news that the part was beyond repair we slept on the bus that night and i thought id faint for the bus was overloaded and had an awful smell about it morning came and we ate the last of the little food we had brought with us the driver went to a house across the road to make a telephone call i later learned that he had called the farm in upstate new york and told them to send another bus it would take the other bus at least another day to reach us we were about  miles from home stranded and without money for food we slept on the bus again that night some of the fellows took their blankets and slept outside but i couldnt put up with those mosquitoes and crawling insects the next morning the driver gave two of the fellows fivedollars to hike to the nearest store four miles away to get baloney and bread for the  of us i noticed that the driver and his companions personalities were changing with each mile from bad to worse when the fellows returned from the store they issued each of us a baloney sandwich it was a measly meal but we were thankful early the next morning the other bus arrived it was in worse condition than the first with the exception that it had a good motor we boarded somewhat relieved somewhat depressed we arrived at our destination late that night the sleeping quarters werent ready we were told so we slept on the bus again that night the next morning we looked the place over and i was disgusted at what i saw the rooms looked as if they would cave in if you coughed loud enough grass was growing through the floor and there was hardly any roof over your head you could sit on your bed if you were lucky enough to get one and see spiders and grasshoppers coming through the cracks there were about  people at this place some from alabama north and south carolina but the largest portion of them were from florida this place is located about five miles from the little town of earlville n y the camp is situated on a high hill with chicken coopmike shacks scattered here and there if you were lucky enough to get any food they had what was called a cookhouse and you would have to stand in line to use it about noon we asked the man that we had been told was in charge of the place when we were going to get something to eat he told us to see his wife and that she would fix us up we went to his wifes shack to inquire about the food she told us that we would have to put our luggage in pawn to her for the food and when we made some money we could get the luggage back i was too hungry to argue with her so we gave her the luggage the next morning we boarded a bus and rode for nearly an hour before we came upon an enor mously large field where there were at least  people picking stringbeans how a person was to make any money with so much competition was beyond me and picking them wasnt as easy as it seemed that day i picked two bushels they call them hampers which was worth a dollar to me i decided that this wasnt for me so a close friend of mine henry and i began saving our dollars and sharing our food how we were going to get our luggage out of pawn was a mystery sometimes while we worked the fellows that didnt work stole our food there was an apple tree not far from the camp with green fruit on it henry and i ate as many of them as we possibly could we finally wrote our parents now that we saw that we couldnt save enough money to come home and told them the condition of things and to send us bus fare but i learned that even your mail wasnt safe so henry and i hiked the five miles to earlville and there we called our parents they accepted the charges and we told them to send the money we had written for care of general delivery to the earlville post office three days later henry and i hiked the five miles back to earlville i was overjoyed when the clerk handed me the letter from mom and dad as if by some miracle there was a letter for henry too we forgot all about our luggage and caught the next bus home when most of the other fellows came home they all had sad tales to tell they said that the foreman began putting up roadblocks to keep the people on the camp for so many were leaving some of the fellows havent come back yet maybe they found jobs up there or something im glad that we got away from that place and ill never go on another of those trips so take it from one who knows the ad in the paper may sound so good but its oh so bad 
shell never know i came
by freda goldstein
the agency sent her that fall after i had spinal surgery and was recuperating i had never had household help in my home and didnt quite know how to handle the relationship howdedo maam she was standing at the door of our old house im sarah bowman the agency sent me to help out i opened the door wide and invited her in it will be good to have help she stood in the oldfashioned entranceway almost timidly but i managed to shut the door in back of her i was making progress and was pleased by my sudden mobility she was unobtrusive those first days and said little beyond acquiescent yes maams or no maams it disturbed me to be addressed so formally i wasnt used to servants and in addition didnt care to get used to servitude in the end it was the common ground of being mothers of adolescent girls that changed our relationship mrs bowman had five children but it was rose who dominated her thoughts and conversation rose got a hundred on her examination yesterday she said at first casually shes pretty good at music too she added glancing at my daughters cello resting in the corner  course we couldnt afford those piana lessons and didnt have no piana anyway the folks at the settlement said rose could be a concert star it was the same with our library rose likes to read she volunteered glancing at our collection she sure is a great reader or commenting on our girls modest attempts at oil painting rose went to the art classes at the settlement she painted real beautiful pictures as the weeks progressed i shared with mrs bowman the joys and setbacks of her daughters school career the teacher sent for me to come parents night she told me one day by this time she had become comfortable enough to drop the title maam or at least suspected it didnt sit well with me something will have to be done about rose she informed me after the parents meeting shes too durned smart for that school at sixteen years of age the girl was completing high school and the problem now was where to place her as i grew stronger mrs bowmans days with me decreased until by spring she was on a twiceaweek basis i could hardly wait to hear of the progress of roses college applications details of the various campaigns were discussed over coffeeand before mrs bowman got the work under way for the day without being too presumptuous i had given my opinion and suggestions you should aim for an integrated school mrs bowman i finally told her rose will probably have a career in science and should have all the advantages a nonsegregated school has to offer how about my husbands college in view of her ambitions for the girl it was strange she resisted this idea i realized she was fearful rose might get hurt and though i knew her fears were wellgrounded i believed one could not get a liberal education in a narrow environment rose would have to take her chances she would gain in the end i was sure we were down to the last hard details roses teacher said there was some kind of place in the city that could help her get into state college she added unnecessarily we cant pay you know i thought a moment perhaps the teacher means the armstrong association they specialize in placing negro students in graduate school and even on positions maybe they could help roses college career had become an intense and personal thing with me i started for the telephone let me call them i recall how she arose abruptly although not finished with her coffee and said strangely reverting to her old custom no no maam rose will do it herself it was a great day when mrs bowman made the final announcement rose got a full scholarship for the paying university she named a school some  miles distant shell be going after the summer this called for more than coffee we had a real celebration rose is graduating first in the class she informed me in early june i wished i could have attended the commencement but no invitation was forthcoming i sent the best gift i could manage mrs bowman was now coming only once a week and always there was a piece of information about roses academic achievements although i was quite pleased with our daughters interests and their progress both in and out of school i fear i prodded them to greater ambition holding up as an example roses attributes the girls determination to do worthwhile things with herself despite the obstacles of her natural environment and the discriminatory barriers she had to hurdle had impressed me tremendously the following fall rose entered the university and immediately began to make giant strides mrs bowman was very pleased i sure never dream when i was little and saw girls from white folks houses go off to college that some day my girl would gojust like them i was almost entirely well by then and since my husbands modest income from teaching had to be stretched to cover the multitude of things one should do when in the academic milieu i had to cut out mrs bowmans weekly visits altogether occasionally she phoned me to see how i was and to bring me to date on roses accomplishments the bowmans didnt have a telephone and i had no way to reach them gradually the calls diminished and then ceased rose became a legend to our girls it was almost summertime when the final call came maam an unfamiliar male voice was on the other end this heres sam sam bowman i had never talked with mrs bowmans husband before and had a sudden premonition of disaster my woman died yestiddy i thought youd wanta know she he faltered she sure was fond of you shocked by the announcement i nevertheless managed to pull myself together sufficiently to mumble some formalities the details of the funeral services now mine i murmured a few kind words and hung up my emotions were mixed between the loss of a good person and roses loss no one else in the family had encouraged or helped her according to mrs bowman they had all referred to her ambitions for her talented daughter as dicty i had had a great affection for sarah bowman and an even greater respect i brushed the warm tears from my face i had never been in that neighborhood before and knew only vaguely where the church was mrs bowman had never said much about her church affiliation it hadnt seemed to play an important role in her life as with me her educational and cultural goals had far exceeded her spiritual drive i left home early the following morning as i was afraid of getting lost but found the church without delay it was empty when i entered it and saw the closed casket down in front of the pulpit i was again alone with sarah bowman i slipped into a seat in the rear and sat in silence watching the sun play on the casket through the stainedglass window it was a small church and it filled quickly it was not until the minister began his service that i realized i was the only white person there i scanned the faces of the teenagers as they entered the first row and wondered which was roses noi rejected a few possibilities she wouldnt dress like that mrs bowman had often told me with pride how the neighboring youngsters had ridiculed roses conservative attire rose couldnt care less what they said she wasnt about to look like a sportin woman as the processional passed i judged the first group of mourners to be the bowman family youngsters of the correct ages clung to a middleaged man but the sixteen or seventeen year old girl alongside of them couldnt have been rose she was disheveled and walked with a sullen swagger brilliant toe nails peeped out of her open sandals as i was physically unable to

the peacocks ugly feet
by irene c edmonds
earliest recollection of the south concerns itself with a peacock i must have been barely three years old i seem to remember riding through a beautiful place in a buggy with my mother and father i am quite sure that someones especial largesse was responsible for the buggy negro presbyterian ministers had little of the worlds goods at that time the swishing of the horses tail and his sleek brown hind quarters occupied most of my attention until suddenly i looked up and there it wasbehind a high black iron fence its fan was all spread out and the shiny lovely colors sent delicious shivers through my body i was quite sure that the rainbow had fallen from the sky my mother told me that this was a bird called a peacock i begged to stop so that i might reach through the black bars to touch the bright feathers but my mother said that we couldnt stop there to forestall my inevitable why she said something elsewouldnt it be wonderful if the peacocks feet were as beautiful as the rest of his body this time my mother answered my why she said his feet are rather ugly to go with the beauty of the rest of him by then i couldnt see the peacock any more but this is what i remember about the place where i was bom the lovely peacock the high black iron fence my mothers wistful words and the ugly feet that did not go with beauty i did not know until a number of years later that the peacock i could not stop to see was in a public park negroes were not allowed there and so for me the peacock has always symbolized the south as i have known it a land of almost circean beauty that has such tragically ugly feet tomorrow i must find a new image the high iron fences have begun to crack and they will someday tumble the ugly feet have started their tortured metamorphosis slowly but positively as token integration moves toward complete desegregation as overt compliance of the law moves toward personal compliance then shall come the great moral crisis in our american society no one will be able to turn his back on it the metamorphosis will be taking place everywhere and it will affect equally the negro and the white the indifferent and the obstinate the northern liberal and the southern extremist many will find for the first time that the negro problem is not comfortably remote it will assault them directly testing their noble sentiments their moral fibre their christian consciences for many whites i realize the next two decades embody changes not easily imagined or readily accepted the negro will be your neighbor his children will be your childrens schoolmates you will encounter him in new roles as a judge in a court of law as a doctor in a hospital as an elected public official as a college teacher the negro will be a part of the larger society that has thus far shut him out his position in that society will be respectable and commanding of respect in hundreds of different situationsin business in social life in daytoday affairsthe negro will be there not as a meek and different new arrival but as fullfledged equal for me tomorrow holds a promise the time will come when the negro will be fully accepted as a human judged as a man and not as a glass cage representative of his race when that day arrives both white and black shall be free each to be straightforward and at ease with the other the white man must turn and face what he has long been avoiding his own prejudices his doubts and fears and the voice of his conscience he cannot continue to take refuge in the outermost suburbs abandoning his home to declining property values and a new negro ghetto further partitioning of society into white and black is no solution a divided america wastes human resources and perpetuates strife it is no answer at all but an uneasy truce that cannot last but integrationtrue integration of the negro into american society will require both wisdom and courage on the part of whites and negroes alike it will require mutual respect and intelligent planning but most of all it will require honesty not everything that is faced can be changed james baldwin has written but nothing can be changed until it is faced the time has now come for us to turn our backs forever on the big twohearted river already the winds of change have begun to blow across the countryfrom south to north testing the moral fibre and courage of the people both black and white we are nearing the fateful moment of personal decision especially in the south it is right and proper that the pressures and demands by the negro for equality and first class citizenship should begin in the south for the south perpetuated the system which enslaved him and though the emancipation proclamation and the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the constitution gave the negro his freedom and civil_rights the south refused to grant him these rights and privileges the circumventions and subterfuges which the south devised to evade the law were all designed for one purpose to keep the negro from ever being admitted to full citizenship this purpose in time became a sacred principle and the south where honor was once the watchword accepted its own fraudulent fabrications as truth in doing this the south lost inevitably some of its character this theme pervades the body of faulkners works so it is right and proper that the pressures and demands for freedom by the negro should begin in the south the south has sinned most against him and there are many good men in the south who think this but it should be pointed out that the difference between the treatment of the negro in the south and that in the north is one of degree and outward show and not in kind segregation discrimination and exclusion of the negro in the north are not legalized but all are practiced against him what the south accomplished by law tradition grandfather clauses and the poll tax the north accomplished by restrictive covenants ghettos and the unspoken word if the negro is a commodity and the white mans burden in the south as faulkner labels him in the north he is a statistic and a remote impersonal problem unconnected with human experience the south thinks it knows the negro and that all of them are alike the north thinks it set him free each belief steeped in myth and illusion distorts the vision and paralyzes the will the north like the south shows little concern about providing equal job opportunities for the negro a study of aid to dependent children in cook county illinois showed that of the job orders placed with private employment in   per cent barred nonwhites still the south is more culpable even when the negro is well prepared for the job the for white only tabs traditionally exclude him no wonder walter lee younger the hero in lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun cries out to his mother in such anguish sometimes its like i can see the future stretched out in front of me just plain as day the future mama hanging over there at the edge of my days just waiting for mea big looming blank space full of nothing just waiting for me pause mamasometimes when im downtown and i pass them cool quietlooking restaurants where them white boys are sitting back and talking bout things    sitting there turning deals worth millions of dollars    sometimes i see guys dont look much older than me so both the north and the south using an elaborately contrived rationale attempt to put to sleep the agonizing aches of christian consciencethe north by the opiate of looking the other way the south by the opiate of living a life which is built on legendary and myth each accuses the other of injustice and intolerance to the negro yet each denies the negro that which every human being must have the dignity of being human no more and no less eliza doolittle in bernard shaws pygmalion discovers a provocative and perceptive truth on her way up from the gutter to respectability via the route of phonetics the difference between a flower girl and a duchess is not in the way she behaves but in the way she is treated to make an analogy the basic difference between a negro and a white person is not in the way he behaves but in the way he is treated what the negro wants more than anything else is to be treated as a mana human being this is no new concept others have said it just as earnestly before me and others will say it with equal earnestness after me but all the racial ferment in our land today has its roots in this one great human want on its insistence by the negro on its resistance by the white man three years ago i remember looking into a pair of eyes that belonged to a young negro college student they were bright with heldback tears as he wrestled with himself over choosing to be fined or to go to jail he had been arrested for participating in a sitin at a lunch counter in a variety store to pay the fine meant graduation on schedule no jailbird stigma and no prolonged expense to his widowed mother to go to jail meant paying the price for his belief in human dignity and freedom he chose the jail before that i had seen those same two eyes overflow with tears of love and pride for country when he heard the starspangled banner backstage in auditoriums in many african schools and cities  he was participating in a cultural exchange program sponsored by the state department and our mission was to demonstrate american democracy and freedom to africans through the drama and by our persontoperson contacts we always played the national anthem before our show and there were nearly always tears in our eyes when we heard it it seemed a tragic paradox to me that this young man should have to cry in america over what he went to sell to africa there are other things the negro wants in addition to human dignity he wants the freedom to enjoy all the privilegesand responsibilities of full american citizenship he wants the freedom to educate himself where he chooses to compete fairly for a job for which he is qualified to eat and live and go where he wills to exercise his right to vote when he wishes to recreate where he desires and to pray in the church of his choice conversely there are things the negro does not want he shrinks from paternalism however disguised not because he needs no help but because paternalism relegates him to the status of a child and robs him of his right to make choices he does not want pity he does not want things made easy for him because he is negro the double standard is dead for him he is through with jim crow and back entrances over and above the hysteria of last ditch stands the racebaiting  leaflets and newspaper editorials the white citizens councils and the black muslims the little rocks and birminghams and new orleans the senescent uncle toms the bull conners and mrs gaillots the headinsand gradualists and the extremists of the right and left stand counterposed the ralph mcgills and archbishop rummels the atlantas and mariettas and dallases the martin_luther_kings and thurgood marshalls the freedom rides and sitins the naacp and core and the southern christian leadership conference world opinion and the men of good will in both races giving impetus to change are the impatient ambitious raceconscious young negroes and their sympathetic young white confreres giving substance is the law of the land in the next two decades the pressures will mount even higher as the horizons of negroes widen their demands will be more insistent integration and desegregation will become accomplished fact increasingly the demands of negroes will beat with imperious insistence upon the ears of the white man on the liberal in the north on the moderate in the south on white men throughout our land it will beat upon negro ears too in an editorial in the atlanta constitution ralph mcgill predicts the various movements of today the sitins the freedom rides and the moves for equal citizenship which the constitution and the statutes provide are not going away until the admitted injustices are removed this in essence is the souths dilemma what will this mean to the negro what will it mean to the white man what will be the response these questions must be faced and answered for the negro the challenge will mean an identification as an american involved in the whole stream of american life this does not mean that he will have to surrender his racial heritage he may have to lose some sense of race he will surely have to lose the sense of inferiority which was fostered in him by the white man he will have to do something on his own initiative without making excuses about the crime and illegitimacy and school dropouts among his people even though he knows that poor and crowded housing and lack of job opportunities are the cause of these ills he will have to assume the responsibility for their remedy the causes cannot absolve him from solutions in addition the negro will have to help close the cultural gap between the races this will be true particularly for the southern negro even though he has wrought the major part of his own transformation from slave to responsible citizen he will have to erase the educational deficiencies occasioned by a separate but unequal school system he will have to compete on a professional level by a single standard for educational and job advancement it also follows that the negro in both the north and the south will have to take full and responsible advantage of the rights and privileges he fought for and gained this includes the ballot he will have to look with sympathy and understanding upon the agony of change whether it be in the white man or the black man he will have to learn that compromise is not synonymous with surrender whatever bitterness he has toward the white man he will have to forget understanding and a consideration for others form the only firm basis for a truly democratic society accomplished integration will have moral implications for the white man in america it will mean first that he must become concerned enough about racial discrimination and injustices that are beyond the reaches of the law to want to do something about them solon is reported to have said upon being asked the condition for perfect justice in athens it will come when those who have not suffered injustice are as indignant as those who have but it is not enough simply to be aware the white man will have to express his indignation in positive action the challenge of personal compliance will mean also that there must be a recognition and an understanding of the negro as a human being the white man will have to give back to the negro the humanity he took away and in so doing regain that portion of his own humanity he lost when he took the negros humanity away it will mean that he must accept with his heart as well as his mind that the negro is a person who possesses the same virtues same faults and foibles same inadequacies same sensibilities same aspirations and hopes and dreams as those he a white man has it will mean the rejection of paternalism however well intentioned yet it will mean the lending of a hand to the negro as both work to close the cultural and educational gap for which he the white man is largely responsible it means having the perceptive insight to know that he has no more to fear from the negro than from any other man in a competitive society for the white south particularly it will mean that the ibsenian ghosts of the past shall no longer rule the life in the present it will mean that the monolithic structure of myth and subterfuge by which the south has denied the negro the basic rights of american citizenship must be demolished it will mean that in this region where both black and white are so deeply rooted and which both love well the freedom road must be no dual highway but one broad expanse where white and black travel together in mutual respect and finally it will mean that christian practice will follow christian ethics to accomplish all this will require the reaching of a moral and intellectual height seldom attained by human beings it calls for more than shallow sentimentality and the remote compassion of northern liberals and southern moderates as the negro moves ahead impatiently and forcefully the challenge will be a direct one assaulting the lives of every american including those who have thus far been peaceably bypassed by the problems and what will be tomorrows promise the feet of the peacock will be beautiful like its body the way they ought to be 
jazz elder statesman
by herbert l wheeldin
herever popular w music is played in the united states and that is just about everywhere the name of george gershwin is known and admired among composers he is accorded a preeminent position that is remarked annually in festivals memorials and longplaying tributes less wellknown however is the name of the man who introduced him to jazz gave him his first lessons and enabled gershwin to make the transition from his classical outlook to the sounds of the new music then sweeping the country it was a fortunate day in the short life of gershwin when the great comic artist bert williams first presented him to his teacher and sponsorluckey roberts today roberts endowed with a memory like a strip of photographic film sits and recalls gershwin as though he lived yesterday he reaches back across the years as if they were days torn from a desk calendar yes he tells us i remember george so clearly back in  he was selling sheet music at remicks on th st he was burning with ambition to learn the fingering for ragtime piano as jazz was called at the time he nearly threw a fit when i played my composition junkman rag for him the stride beat the crossfingering and the complicated chords were all quite contrary to his classical training but he was quick he had a natural gift for music later on he borrowed from my tune and then ill come back to you in order to write his famous the man i love and even today when i play the two tunes back to back they sound like a couple of peas spit from the same mouth luckey roberts or charles luckeyeth as he was baptized in philadelphia looks back over a career spanning  years in the world of entertainment during that time he has attained the proportions of a legend in theatrical and music circles even while he remains unknown to the public at large despite this anonymity he may well be one of the great show personalities of our time his twinkling eyes are deepset in a buddhashaped face creased by a broadbrimmed smile with skin the color of peanut butter short of stature with rolypoly figure he projects an infectious zestful charm that insistently compels his listeners attention indeed his charm a kind of personality magic has affected some of the greatest members of our countrys social establishments who have sought his services and advice for his roster of musical clients and students reads like a rollcall of the social register one  of his most publicized pupils was the prince of wales known to our era as the duke of windsor the onetime king of england who yielded his throne for love of an american divorcee again roberts unlocks his memory files when the prince first came here in  he was the lion of the social season i remember playing at receptions in his honor for seventeen successive nights at one in particular the sanfords laddiea famous polo player spent   for a single nights entertainment why their estate out on long island was decorated for miles around with wax candles it took the servants three hours just to light them up and the princehe was crazy about our music he hung around the bandstand all night and never seemed happier than when i let him sit in on the drums he sort of fancied himself with the brushes from that time on i became his mentor and gave him lessons in rhythm later even after he became king i used to send him records and sheet music so he could keep up with jazz undoubtedly roberts great musical gifts and winning personality made it possible for him to transcend the deep social gulf that separates the negro from the upper strata of society when the young son of president roosevelt wed the daughter of the dupont empire back in  paul whiteman was bypassed to insure that luckey roberts should preside over the musical end of the festivities for season after season his orchestras supplied a steady stream of rhythms at the receptions and the cotillions of j p morgan commodore vanderbilt andrew carnegie marquis de cuevas and numerous other families who comprised americas  as they were then called and till this day roberts fondly remembers what an apt pupil at the piano was doris duke heiress to the camel cigarette fortune but it is not for his associations that he deserves a footnote in negro history rather is it for his genuine creative abilities which have contributed so much to the growth of popular music in america and the world millions of people are sentimentally indebted to him for his inimitable composition moonlight cocktail an alltime favorite among popular tunes on hearing its lilting melody many persons invariably identify it with glenn miller who made it the musical signature of his orchestra few are aware that roberts composed this song way back in  under the title ripples of the nile it proved so difficult for musicians and singers that it lay dormant for over  years originally it was a fast number with right hand figuration of the greatest technical difficulty and none of luckeys pupils including the famous james p johnson could execute it perfectly subsequently he found it necessary to score it as a slow number and publish it as moonlight cocktail recently a new england newspaper the hartford courant referred to roberts as the grand old man of jazz music and truthfully speaking roberts is perhaps the oldest living founder of jazz and popular music not only gershwin but rodgers ellington berlin loesser fats waller and all the noted composers are obligated to him in some measure for they benefited by the creative dimension and prodigious technique he brought to jazz he was among the first to apply the contrapuntal effects of bach to jazz and is regarded among musicians as a master of the intricate meshing of counterpoint harmony and rhythm essential to the production of solid music 
can african 
students get a better education in africa 
by brooks johnson
african students j studying in the united  states this represents an increase of more than  per cent over the totals for the academic year  it is expected that the percentage increase will continue to rise for  it costs approximately  a year to maintain a student in the u s for a year this means that approximately  was spent to educate african students in the u s for the academic year  if the present trend continues we can confidently assume that this year we will see this figure increase another four to six million dollars bringing the total for the  year to between  and  there should rest in no ones mind any doubt that this represents a sizable expenditure to educate people who are nationals of other nations before we proceed further it might help to briefly examine and explore possible motivations for such expenditures the u s population represents nearly  per cent of the total world population but it produces  per cent of the worlds food supply and consumes all but  per cent of this supply at home most of the remainder is shamefully stored at government expense in warehouses the u s has more than  times as many possessions as the rest of the world it has  times as much steel  times as much coal and  times as much general equipment as the rest of the world but more than half of the people of the world dont know how to read and write go to bed hungry at night have never heard of jesus christ more than half of them have however heard of marx stalin khrushchev and their ideologies i think these statistics will give the reader some indication why the u s is spending so much money educating nationals from abroad in america for a moment it would be good to utilize a device used in an article by mr henry smith leipur a field secretary for the american bible society let us assume that the world has been compressed to a population of  people americans would represent a grand total of  most of the remaining  would be hungry most of the time the american  would eat  per cent more than the maximum food requirements they could actually save money by giving the excess food away that they store each year is it any wonder the american  having an average income of  a year find that they are forced to pay on an average of  a year for defense they spend less than  a year for gifts other than private and personal gifts one can easily raise the question about the real meaning of the christian faith spirit of christmas peace on earth and good will among men as applied and practiced by the american  when these figures are compared it probably is amply apparent that americans dont give as much as perhaps they should or could but still our amounts far exceed those of russia or any other nation americans in terms of dollars and cents give more than any other two nations combined our concern here however will be whether or not america is spending its dollars wisely regarding the education of africans there is a growing feeling among some interested parties that the best place to educate africans is in africa unesco leaders in the congo leopoldville advise if the congo is to have the leadership it desperately needs the congolese must remain here for their higher education  or at least in africa from chad comes the report that what is sometimes considered a humorous observation is all too true in too many instances it goes african students if they do return from study abroad come back from soviet countries antired but from paris they return as avowed communists mr m a kabangi congolese minister of planning and coordination says i believe that the hope for peace and progress in this country as in all the new republics of africa is education at every level education in africa for african living  in close touch with african cultures and african needs and increasingly by africans themselves to achieve this we need the help of individuals and organizations from abroad who will honestly put our need and the common good of all peoples above their own individual or national interests and prestige  by providing their educational help here with many teachers coming to us instead of taking our higher students away with big grants for foreign study the above quotes come from an on the spot report prepared by martha lucas pate a first report on higher education in africa let us consider a case in point in  one of the finest universities in africa was founded in the belgian congo lovanium university has been described as being   so extensive so handsome and so wellequipped that ones first visit is like    seeing a mirage here are some of the reasons for such a statement the university has many modern buildings that are spaciously located on the cam pus which overlooks leopoldville and the valley of the congo river the science laboratories are equipped with advanced and complex equipment not to mention the atomic reactor of which it is the proud possessor the main library has in excess of  volumes with regular incoming volumes numbering over  in addition there are  smaller libraries affiliated with special schools of study such as law medicine bed hospital philosophy science theology social science agronomy psychology and teaching as well as the several museums and the university press the total cost for what was only partially described on the previous page was the equivalent of  the university is now equipped to give an education to  students the total enrollment is only     this is a very interesting fact when one is constantly being reminded how greatly american colleges are overcrowded when asked by mrs pate if the students did any work toward defraying the cost of their education she was told by the assistant rector if we required any physical work there would be no students here they would all accept scholarships abroad when an african student comes to the u s to study the direct benefits of his coming accrue mostly to him the same money that is necessary to educate him here in the u s could be used in africa to establish facilities to educate more people and the process would be repeated over and over again with resultant benefits to a much wider spectrum of the population this fact when taken with certain other considerations would seem to indicate that the most practical and economical use of money to educate africans would be to spend it building african institutions in africa if an african student comes to america and his stay here is a success he is most reluctant to return thus partially defeating the purpose of his coming if he has really benefitted from his stay then there are many scholarships and awards to tempt him to extend his stay even longer if he takes his ba ma and phd here it means he will have been exposed to american standards for more than  years after this time it is even more difficult for him to return if on the other hand his stay is not a success what have we accomplished we have exposed him to all the disadvantages of the american democracy and its ideosyncracies and he is a very receptive sounding board for antiamerican propaganda having actually been in america he becomes even more convincing in his arguments against her to his people as one who has returned he of course is in a much better position to lead his country and determine policies than one who hasnt it is not intended to imply that all africans should be limited to studying in africa but it is suggested that many africans are studying in america who would better serve the needs of their own nations by studying at home with american encouragement and aid things happen too swiftly in africa for its gifted nationals to be away from it for extended lengths of time surely there are certain postdoctorate and doctorate scholars who would greatly benefit from study in the u s and in turn the u s would greatly benefit from having invited them this would no doubt be the case at any time and regardless of the educational facilities in africa or the u s but the wholesale luring away of the best young african talent at this time doesnt appear to be the wisest expenditure of educational resources it would appear that economical political propagandaselfish and unselfish and educational considerations dictate that most africans should be educated in africa recently the author had occasion to speak with mr joseph kasongo former president of the chamber of deputies from the congo and presently serving a term as a national deputy i put the idea of educating africans in africa as it appears here a broad smile coyly spread across his face as he informed me that he had given a speech in the chamber of deputies with the very same message and import he put to me what he felt was a crippling consideration certainly the american dollars could buy very fine facilities and buildings perhaps even more than necessary in some cases there was no doubt in many africans minds that the needs of africa and the policies of the u s could best be served by educating africans at home there is certainly no doubt that such programs would have the additional beneficial effect of helping local economies but there still remained for him this one devastating problem who would educate the students in most of the better universities in america there are compulsory retirement ages usually  in too many cases these men are still very capable and creative there are literally hundreds of professors emeriti who would more than welcome the opportunity and challenge of plying their talents and vast knowledge to adequatelyequipped schools in africa sponsored by american capital and encouraged by u s goodwill there is currently a great interest in american universities in establishing african studies programs new departments devoted to this field are springing up in colleges around the country almost as fast as football coaches lose their jobs the graduates of these programs usually hold advanced degrees and would welcome the opportunity to teach their various areas of study abroad there are many professors who for various other reasons and considerations would gladly accept teaching positions abroad as mr kasongo heard of these possible professional recruits he punctuated the remarks by pounding his fist in his hand with satisfaction he was evidently sold on the idea of educating africans in africa and the desirability feasibility and advantages of such a scheme his final words spoken with great deliberation and concern now if we can only convince the government of the united states of the merit of this these words stiff point up the pertinent and decisive factors

hree men stood in v rjp  the dust and looked  i at roadsign in two days we shall be in our homecountry said tsolo tsolo maki and temba had been many days on the road to the valley of a thousand hills during the day they walked in the yellow dirt beneath the sun and at night they lighted their fires beside the road and allowed their weariness to drain into the thirsting earth they spoke little for the horror of the place they had left remained with them more than four hundred of their fellow miners had died in the disaster and after three weeks of vain efforts to reach those who had been cut off from them by the fall of rock a funereal quiet had fallen over the workings the silent the sullen the weeping the bewildered wives and relatives who had pressed around the fence had gone and in their place torn newspapers were impaled on the wire barbs by the wind the silent winding gear cut a stark silhouette against the grey sky and the activity of the compound became the despairing preparation for departure of a refugee transit camp the heat of this sun is heavy on our shoulders like the burden of the white mans laws said tsolo freeing his arms and dropping his pack in the dust at his feet or like the suffering of our people at the mine said maki there are some things we shall not speak of said tsolo we will change the laws of the white man but the suffering at the mine can never be changed for a moment they were silent because it was with sadness that they remembered the suffering at the mine let us stay here for the night so that we shall be strong for the walk tomorrow said temba no rather we should walk through the night because then we shall be home by tomorrow evening said maki now that i am almost home my legs are strong and know no tiredness we will stay here said tsolo he led the way through a break in the fence and they followed him into the deeplyetched dry riverbed and that was the way it had always been tsolo was the leader when they had been at home together it had been tsolo who led them to plough and when the inadequate soil had become poor and the crops had failed they had followed him to the labourrecruiting office once they had even followed him to prison but that had been a long time ago his will was the strongest and that was the way it had always been this is a good place said tsolo dropping his blankets in the sand at the foot of the steep bank it would be better if we went where the river turns and where we cannot be seen from the road said maki in this place there is danger there was a silence and then his voice returned there is danger  is danger    danger    who is it that mocks us said maki it is a trick of the hills tsolo replied temba placed his blanket roll firmly beside that of tsolo this is a good place he agreed f so they sat for a while in the fading warmth of the sand and watched the shadow of the bank creep across the riverbed it was tsolo who spoke first do you remember that we came through a fence to get here yes said temba it was you who found the opening for us and what does it mean that we came through a fence it means that we are on the land of a white farmer now if i tell you that my stomach is making the rumbling sounds of hunger then i would say that on a farm such as this there are sheep ah you are a good fellow temba how shall i say    a good fellow tsolo said slapping temba on the back yes a very good fellow temba felt good it is from you that i have learnt these things he said their talk sounded faintly in the background of makis thoughts he thought of the joy of the homecoming that was before him and the sorrow of the place that lay behind him of his escape from the falling rocks that had entombed the miners and of the talk that it had happened because of the white mineowners those who had not provided for their safety he thought too of his friend moses yes moses who had lost his life in the disaster only two days before he was due to leave the mine two days before he was to return to his family only two days of how happy he had been and of the laughter in his eyes when he had spoken of his home and then there had been the sound like the report of a great gun and the ceiling of the mine had fallen on his dreams then he remembered the first few days when they had laboured with hope and the many days that followed when they struggled to clear the broken earth without hope but mostly he thought of home and of the anxious period of waiting while those who were returning to mozambique boarded their trains when the three of them knew that their wives would have heard of the sadness that had come to the mine and would worry for their safety then they had been told that they would have to wait a further two weeks for transport to their homecountry and tsolo had rolled up his blankets and spoken and they had followed him he is a dreamer this maki said tsolo yes and a fool for when we speak of sheep we are speaking of food said temba you want me to worry with food when my mind is filled with much bigger things said maki in two days i shall be home with my wife my son will ask me to tell him stories of the things i have  seen we shall sit beside the fire and then i shall tell him of the painful things that i have seen in being with my family there is far greater pleasure than in answering the squeals of my stomach am i therefore a dreamer what you have learnt of life is like nothing said tsolo you have learnt to cut coal and to dream but you have learnt no wisdom he spoke with the bitter dust of the road in his voice we cannot live on dreams said temba you speak of home  said tsolo but what is this home if it is not a patch of poor soil on which our families must starve if we do not find work on the mines so that we can send money to our children and you speak of this home as if it were heaven you are a dreamer just like the one at the mine who was called moses yes you are like moses shouted temba and the hills repeated you are like moses    are like moses    like moses    i do not like this place we should leave for even the hills mock us for this talk of stealing sheep when we should be on the road said maki ah so now our dreamer is afraid of an echo jeered temba come said tsolo let us leave him to his dreams or his fears there is mens work for us to do but why should we do this thing now when we are so near to home said maki we may be caught and then it will be many days before we can continue on our path these farmers fear us because they are ignorant of us this fear sometimes causes them to do terrible things to us i have my knife ready let us find a sheep said temba yes then let us go said tsolo maki you will make the fire for us while we are gone if we are caught it will be many days he shouted after them as they moved beyond the lip of the bank and they did not reply but the hills answered it will be many days  be many days    many days    then darkness and silence came to the bed of the river and the cold breeze of solitude was chill upon him beyond the towering blackness of the opposite bank filtered light from the invisible moon wove the fabric of the sky with blue threads he gathered the driftwood of a longpast flood and heaped it against a boulder in the sandy centre of the place where the stream had been in the warmth of the flames he felt the companionship of his family if he excluded all else the dancing yellow forms created about him the walls of his hut the gentle love of his wife and he heard the thirsty questions of his son beside him and he planned how he would tell of the many long roads he had traversed to be with him and still he is dreaming the voice of tsolo scorned from out of the dark maki shook himself free of his thoughts as the two figures stepped into the light first tsolo carrying the knife and then temba with the carcass of a sheep slung over his shoulder ha said temba he has not even watched the fire wellmust it also die take this said tsolo handing maki the knife we men have done our worknow it is for the one with the heart of a woman to prepare the sheep for the cooking but if we are found with the blood of this sheep on our hands we shall not reach home said maki must we not eat if we are to have strength for the journey tomorrow said temba you dream of dangerthere is no one here jeered tsolo and the hills confirmed there is no one here  is no one here  no one here    with the knife in his hand maki stood erect before the glowing coals my strength does not come from that which belongs to other men he said tsolo became angry do we not cut coal so that they become rich do we not build roads so that they can drive on them while we must walk has not everything that they have been taken from us you worry because we take this sheep they have taken all from useven our strength but i am already strong shouted maki because i am almost home from the bank above them came a challenge and the sharp crack of a shotgun tsolo and temba fled from the light and vanished into the blackness where the river turned out of sight of the road just beyond the ragged circle of firelight illuminated by the weakening flare lay three bundles of blankets and beside the fire two crumpled heaps the sheep and maki and the hills mocked i am almost home    am almost home    almost home

the day joey  procopio got his new t sled we all went up to yates castle to slide  joeys sled was one of the new ones a flexible flyer if youve known sleds you know theres not much streamlining they can do with them but joeys was as sleek as the empire state express our slide was through bare chestnut maple and oak trees down a hill of about  degrees there was a huge oak at the greatest depth of the decline at which we began our turn to keep from shooting over the sidewalk and down into the street we slid all afternoon joey would occasionally allow one of us to use his sled we all agreed that his flexible flyer was the fastest thing on runners we took our penultimate slides and gathered once more at the crest of the hill again for the last one we all went down before joey this time we didnt mind it seemed fitting that the owner of the flexible flyer should be the last one down kind of like a sea captain from the bottom of the hill we watched joey secure and proud in this honor start running with his sled moving it to and away from his body as he ran in crisp strides suddenly he tripped and as he crashed to the ground his head jerking upright to watch it the sled leaped from his hands as though it had a life of its own it sped over roots around bushes and trees speeding downhill its red runners were like streaks of blood against the snow and its golden boards flashed like bits of sun the sled hit the sidewalk and flew straight out into the street and landed on an even keel it was zipping across the roadway when the car came the driver thought a kid was on it and he swung this way and that and finally slammed on his brakes the car spun skidded then jerked out of it with a snap the sled squealing beneath one of its wheels so hard that the runners dug up the snow clear down to the asphalt the driver was shaking when he got out we could not move slowly the driver bent beneath the wheel of the car and looked he had his butt in the air like a chicken eating slowly like the air had been let out of him he sank to his knees and did not move for a long time we looked back up the hill then at joey who was still sprawled on his stomach the driver pulled the sled from beneath the wheel and kicked it to the curb the sled was shattered the runners crumpled the driver got back into his car and drove away slowly and in silence and in the cold which seemed to have come suddenly we clambered down crossed the road and looked at the sled joey came up last and when he saw it he started to cry and none of us could tell him he was lucky he hadnt been on it because he was anticipating the beating his father was going to give him 
er an cl son
had been away two
i
y days and i was getting
 hungry tired of
 g stealing milk from
porch stoops and fruits
from hucksters some of whom
were pretty swift afoot for old men
i drifted nearer and nearer home
as i approached it circled around
it seeing the lights on in the living
room i felt very unwanted and unlived
i moved further away
i walked aimlessly down townsend
street which was being demolished
for the new housing project
only god knows how many
of those abandoned homes id pilfered
for lead to sell to mr ullman
 the junkman as i passed the gouged out foundations a voice called out my father i glanced once behind me then raced on up the street only my father and i were on it and he id seen at the first glance had been shopping at the black and yellow painted american store he was clutching two great bags the sight and sound of him immediately reassured me that i never wanted to go home again and so we raced at what age does a son outrace his father seventeen eighteen sixteen my father was a young man used to hard work and baseball and i was far from sixteen in fact i wasnt twelve yet we sped past the shells of homes which caught the sounds of our pantings and of our feet beating a crazy crescendo against the pavement and so we ran and i was pulling away half a foot by half a foot and i knew if i could last to the corner and make the alley i was gone i bent my head my knees came up faster the pavement socked against my toes i swear i could hear the wind racing by wind i was creating but when he called his footsteps falling further and further behind my son my son something within me broke and i slowed then stopped and sat down he trotted up and sat down beside me when we got up he handed me a bag he placed his free arm around my shoulder and its touch told me that it was not to restrain but to feel close i knew i was going to get it though but i went anyway

man dont know what  g hell do a man dont p know what he is till he gets his back pressed up against a wall now you take aaron lott there aint no other way to explain the crazy thing he did he was going along fine preaching the gospel saving souls and getting along with the white folks and then all of a sudden he felt wood pressing up against his back the funny thing was that nobody knew he was hurting till he preached that red sea sermon where he got mixed up and seemed to think mississippi was egypt as chairman of the deacons board i felt it was my duty to reason with him i appreciated his position and told him so but i didnt think it was right for him to push us all in a hole the old foolhe just laughed brother booker he said the lordhell take care of me i knew then that that man was heading for trouble and the very next thing he did confirmed it the white folks called the old fool downtown to bear witness that the colored folks were happy and you know what he did he got down there amongst all them big white folks and he said things aint gonna change here overnight but they gonna change its inevitable the lord wants it well sir you could have bought them white folks for a penny aaron lott pastor of the rock of zion baptist church a man white folks had said was wise and sound and sensible had come closetoo closeto saying that the supreme court was coming to melina mississippi the surprising thing was that the white folks didnt do nothing there was a lot of mumbling and whispering but nothing had happened till the terrible morning when aaron came aknocking at the door of my funeral home now things had been tightening up you could feel it in the airand i didnt want no part of no crazy scheme and i told him so right off he walked on past me and sat down on the couch he had on his preaching clothes a shiny blue suit a fresh starched white shirt a black tie and his sunday black shoes i remember thinking at the time that aaron was too black to be wearing all them dark clothes the thought tickled me and i started to smile but then i noticed something about him that didnt seem quite right i ran my eyes over him closely he was kinda middlesized and he had a big cleanshaven head a big nose and thin lips i stood there looking at him for a long time but i couldnt figure out what it was till i looked at his eyes they were burning bright like light bulbs do just before they go out and yet he looked contented like his mind was resting somewheres else i wanna talk with you co booker he said glancing sideways at my wife if you dont mind sister brown m sarah got up and went into the living quarters aaron didnt say nothing for a long time he just sat there looking out the window then he spoke so soft i had to strain my ears to hear im leaving for the baptist convention he said he pulled out his gold watch and looked at it train leaves in bout two hours i know that aaron i was impatient for him to get on with it yeah but what i wanted to tell you was that i aint going jim crow im going first class booker right through the white waiting room thats the law a cold shiver ran through me aaron i said dont you go talking crazy now the old fool laughed a great big bodyshaking laugh he started talking bout god and jesus and all that stuff now im a godfearing man myself but i holds that god helps those who help themselves i told him so you cant mix god up with these white folks i said when you start to messing around with segregation theyll burn you up and the bible too he looked at me like i was satan i sweated over this thing he said i prayed i got down on my knees and i asked god not to give me this cup but he said  was the one i heard him booker right herehe tapped his chestin my heart the old fools been having visions i thought i sat down and tried to figure out a way to hold him but he got up without saying a word and started for the door wait i shouted ill get my coat i dont need you he said i just came by to tell you so you could tell the board in case something happened you wait i shouted and ran out of the room to get my coat we got in his beatup old ford and went by the parsonage to get his suitcase rachelthat was his wifeand jonah were sitting in the living room wringing their hands aaron got his bag shook jonahs hand and said take care of your mamma boy jonah nodded aaron hugged rachel and pecked at her cheek rachel broke down she throwed her arms around his neck and carried on something awful aaron shoved her away dont go making no fuss over it woman i aint gonna be gone forever cant a man go to a church meeting thout women screaming and crying he tried to make light of it but you could see he was touched by the way his lips trembled he held his hand out to me but i wouldnt take it i told him off good told him it was a sin and a shame for a man of god to be carrying on like he was worrying his wife and everything im coming with you i said somebodys gotta see that you dont make a fool of yourself he shrugged picked up his suitcase and started for the door then he stopped and turned around and looked at his wife and his boy and from the way he looked i knew that there was still a chance he looked at the one and then at the other for a moment there i thought he was was going to cry but he turned quicklike and walked out of the door i ran after him and tried to talk some sense in his head but he shook me off turned the corner and went on up adams street i caught up with him and we walked in silence crossing the street in front of the first baptist church for whites going on around the confederate monument where once they hung a boy for fooling around with white women put it off aaron i begged sleep on it he didnt say nothing what you need is a vacation ill get the board to approve full pay and everything he smiled and shifted the suitcase over to his left hand big drops of sweat were running down his face and spotting up his shirt his eyes were awful all lit up and burning aaron aaron cant you hear me we passed the feed store bill williams grocery store and the movie house  a mans gotta think about his family aaron a man aint free didnt you say that once didnt you he shaded his eyes with his hand and looked into the sun he put the suitcase on the ground and checked his watch why dont you think about jonah i asked answer that why dont you think about your own son i am he said thats exactly what im doing thinking about jonah matter of fact he started me to thinking i aint never mentioned it before but the boys been worrying me one day we was downtown here and he asked me something that hurt daddy he said how come you aint a man i got mad i did and told him i am a man he said that wasnt what he meant i mean he said how come you aint a man where white folks concerned i couldnt answer him booker ill never forget it till the day i die i couldnt answer my own son and i been preaching forty years he dont know nothing bout it i said hes hotheaded like my boy hell find out when he grows up i hopes not aaron said shaking his head i hopes not some white folks passed and we shut up till they were out of hearing aaron who was acting real strange looked up in the sky and moved his lips he came back to himself after a little bit and he said this thing of being a man booker is a big thing the supreme court cant make you a man the naacp cant do it god almighty can do a lot but even he cant do it aint nobody can do it but you he said that like he was preaching and when he got through he was all filled up with emotion and he seemed kind of ashamedhe was a man who didnt like emotion outside the church he looked at his watch picked up his bag and said well lets git it over with we turned into elm and the first thing i saw at the end of the street was the train station it was an old red building flat like a slab a group of white men were fooling around in front of the door i couldnt make them out from that distance but i could tell they werent the kind of white folks to be fooling around with we walked on passing the dry goods store the barber shop and the new building that was going up across the street from that was the sheriffs office i looked in the window and saw bull sampson sitting at his desk his feet propped up on a chair a fat brown cigar sticking out of his mouth a ball about the size of a sweet potato started burning in my stomach please aaron i said please you cant get away with it i know how you feel sometimes i feel the same way myself but i wouldnt risk my neck to do nothing for hese niggers they wont appreciate it theyll laugh at you we were almost to the station and i could make out the faces of the men sitting on the benches one of them must have been telling a joke he finished and the group broke out laughing i whispered to aaron im through with it i wash my hands of the whole mess i dont know whether he heard me or not he turned to the right without saying a word and went on in the front door the stringbeany man who told the joke was so shocked that his cigarette fell out of his mouth yall see that he said why ill shut up another man said go git bull i kept walking fast turned at the corner and ran around to the colored waiting room when i got in there i looked through the ticket window and saw aaron standing in front of the clerk aaron stood there for a minute or more but the clerk didnt see him and that took some not seeing in that room aaron lott stood out like a pig in a chicken coop there were id say about ten or fifteen people in there but didnt none of them move they just sat there with their eyes glued on aarons back aaron cleared his throat the clerk didnt look up he got real busy with some papers aaron cleared his throat again and opened his mouth to speak the screen door of the waiting room opened and clattered shut it got real quiet in that room hospital quiet it got so quiet i could hear my own heart beating now aaron knew who opened that door but he didnt bat an eyelid he turned around real slow and faced high sheriff sampson the baddest man in south mississippi mr sampson stood there with his legs wide open like the men you see on television his beefy face was bloodred and his gray eyes were rattlesnake hard he was mad no doubt about it i had never seen him so mad preacher he said you done gone crazy he was talking lowlike and mean nosir aaron said nosir mr sampson what you think you doing going to st louis mr sampson you must done lost yo mind boy mr sampson started walking towards aaron with his hand on his gun twenty or thirty men pushed through the front door and fanned out over the room mr sampson stopped about two paces from aaron and looked him up and down that look had paralyzed hundreds of niggers but it didnt faze aaron nonehe stood his ground im gonna give you a chance preacher git on over to the nigger side and git quick i aint bothering nobody mr sampson  somebody in the crowd yelled dont reason wit the nigger bull hit em mr sampson walked up to aaron and grabbed him in the collar and throwed him up against the ticket counter he pulled out his gun did you hear me deacon i said git  im going to st louis mr sampson thats cross state lines the court done said aaron didnt have a chance the blow came from nowhere laying there on the floor with blood spurting from his mouth aaron looked up at mr sampson and he did another crazy thing he grinned bull sampson jumped up in the air and came down on aaron with all his two hundred pounds it made a crunchy sound he jumped again and the mob maddened by the blood and heat moved in to help him they fell on aaron like mad dogs they beat him with chairs they beat him with sticks they beat him with guns till this day i dont know what come over me the first thing i know i was running and then i was standing in the middle of the white waiting room mr sampson was the first to see me he backed off cocked his pistol and said booker boy you come one mo step and ill kill you whats a matter with you niggers today all yall gone crazy please dont kill him i begged   you aint got no call to treat him like that so you saw it all did you well then booker you musta saw the nigger preacher reach for my gun he didnt do that mr sampson i said he didnt mr sampson put a big hairy hand on my tie and pulled me to him booker he said sweetly you saw the nigger preacher reach for my gun didnt you i didnt open my mouthi couldnt i was so scaredbut i guess my eyes answered for me whatever mr sampson saw there musta convinced him cause he throwed me on the floor besides aaron git this nigger out of here he said and be quick about it dropping to my knees i put my hand on aarons chest i didnt feel nothing i felt his wrist i didnt feel nothing i got up and looked at them white folks with tears in my eyes i looked at the women sitting crying on the benches i looked at the men i looked at mr sampson i said he was a good man mr sampson said move the nigger a big sigh came out of me and i wrung my hands mr sampson said move the nigger he grabbed my tie and twisted it but i didnt feel nothing my eyes were glued to his hands there was blood under the fingernails and the fingersthey looked like fat little red sausages i screamed and mr sampson flung me down on the floor he said move the nigger i picked aaron up and fixed his body over my shoulder and carried him outside i sent for one of my boys and we dressed him up and put him away real nicelike and rachel and the boy came and they cried and carried on and yet somehow they seemed prouder of aaron than ever before and the colored folksthey seemed proud too crazy niggers didnt they know couldnt they see it hadnt done no good in fact things got worse the northern newspapers started kicking up a stink and mr rivers the solicitor announced they were going to hold a hearing all of a sudden booker taliaferro brown became the biggest man in that town my phone rang day and night i got threats i got promises and i was offered bribes everywhere i turned somebody was waiting to ask me whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna say to tell the truth i didnt know myself one day i would decide one thing and the next day  would decide another it was mr rivers and mr sampson who called my attention to that they came to my office one day and called me a shifty nogood nigger they said they expected me to stand by my statement in the train station that i saw aaron reach for the gun i hadnt said no such thing but mr sampson said i said it and he said he had witnesses who heard me say it and if you say anything else he said i cant be responsible for your health now you knowhe put that bloody hand on my shoulder and he smiled his sweet death smileyou know i wouldnt threaten you but the boyshe shook his headthe boys are real worked up over this one it was long about then that i began to hate aaron lott im ashamed to admit it now but its true i hated him he had lived his life he had made his choice why should he live my life too and make me choose it wasnt fair it wasnt right it wasnt christian what made me so mad was the fact that nothing i said would help aaron he was dead and it wouldnt help one whit for me to say that he didnt reach for that gun i tried to explain that to rachel when she came to my office moaning and crying the night before the hearing listen to me woman i said listen aaron was a good man he lived a good life he did a lot of good things but hes dead dead dead nothing i say will bring him back bull sampsons got ten niggers who are going to swear on a stack of bibles that they saw aaron reach for that gun it wont do me or you or aaron no good for me to swear otherwise what did i say that for that woman liked to had a fit she got  down on her knees and she begged me to go with aaron go wit him she cried booker booker if yous a man if yous a father if yous a friend go wit aaron that woman tore my heart up i aint never heard nobody beg like that please woman please i said please dont carry on like that tell the truth booker she said thats all im asking tell the truth truth i said hah thats all you niggers talk about truth what do you know about truth truth is eating good and sleeping good truth is living rachel be loyal to the living rachel backed off from me you would have thought that i had cursed her or something she didnt say nothing she just stood there pressed against the door she stood there saying nothing for so long that my nerves snapped say something i begged say somethinganything  she shook her head slowly at first and then her head started moving like it wasnt attached to her body it went back and forth back and forth back and forth i started towards her but she jerked open the door and ran out into the night screaming that did it i ran across the room to the filing cabinet opened the bottom drawer and took out a dusty bottle of scotch i started drinking but the more i drank the soberer i got i guess i fell asleep cause i dreamed i buried rachel and that everything went along fine until she jumped out of the casket and started screaming i came awake with a start and knocked over the bottle i reached for a rag and my hand stopped in midair of course i said out loud and slammed my fist down on the scotchsoaked papers i didnt see nothing why didnt i think of it before i didnt see nothing jumping up i walked to and fro in the office would it work i rehearsed it in my mind all i could see was aarons back i dont know whether he reached for the gun or not all i know is that for some reason the men beat him to death rehearsing the thing in my mind i felt a great weight slip off my shoulders i did a little jig in the middle of the floor and went upstairs to my bed whistling sarah turned over and looked me up and down what you happy about cant a man be happy i asked she sniffed the air oh she said and pressed her lips together she turned over and mumbled something in her pillow it came to me then for the first time that she was bout the only person in town who hadnt asked me what i was going to do i thought about it for a little while shrugged and fell into bed with all my clothes on when i woke up the next morning i had a terrible headache and my tongue was a piece of sandpaper for a long while i couldnt figure out what i was doing laying there with all my clothes on then it came to me this was the big day i put on my black silk suit the one i wore for big funerals and went downstairs to breakfast i walked into the dining room without looking and bumped into russell the last person in the world i wanted to see he was my only child but he didnt act like it he was always finding fault he didnt like the way i talked to negroes he didnt like the way i talked to white folks he didnt like this he didnt like that and to top it off the young whippersnapper wanted to be an artist undertaking wasnt good enough for him he wanted to paint pictures i sat down and grunted good morning papa he said it like he meant it he wants something i thought looking him over closely noticing that his right eye was swollen you been fighting again boy yes papa you younguns education thats what it is education its ruining you he didnt say nothing he just sat there looking down when i looked up and looking up when i looked down this went on through the grits and the eggs and the second cup of coffee whatcha looking at i asked nothing papa whatcha thinking nothing papa you lying boy its written all over your face he didnt say nothing i dismissed him with a wave of my hand picked up the paper and turned to the sports page what are you going to do papa the question caught me unawares i know now that i was expecting it that i wanted him to ask it but he put it so bluntly that i was flabbergasted i pretended i didnt understand do bout what boy speak up about the trial papa i didnt say nothing for a long time there wasnt much in fact i could say so i got mad questions questions questions i shouted thats all i get in this housequestions you never have a civil word for your pa i go out of here and work my tail off and you keep yourself shut up in that room of yours looking at them fool books and now soon as your old man gets his back against the wall you join the pack i expected better than that of you boy a son ought to back his pa that hurt him he picked up the coffee pot and poured himself another cup of coffee and his hand trembled he took a sip and watched me over the rim they say you are going to chicken out papa  chicken out what that mean theyre betting youll tom  i leaned back in the chair and took a sip of coffee so theyre betting huh the idea appealed to me crazy niggerstheyd bet on a funeral i saw pain on his face he sighed and said i bet too papa the cup fell out of my hand and broke spilling black water over the tablecloth you did what i bet you wouldnt tom  you little fool i fell out laughing and then i stopped suddenly and looked at him closely how much you bet one hundred dollars i stood up youre lying i said whered you get that kind of money from mamma sarah i shouted sarah you get in here what kind of house you running sneaking behind my back giving this boy money to gamble with sarah leaned against the door jamb she was in her hot iron mood there was no expression on her face and her eyes were hard i gave it to him booker she said they called you an uncle tom he got in a fight about it he wanted to bet on you booker he believes in you suddenly i felt old and used up i pulled a chair to me and sat down please i said waving my hand please go away leave me alone please  i sat there for maybe ten or fiften minutes thinking praying the phone rang it was mr withers the president of the bank i had put in for a loan and it had been turned down but mr withers said thered been a mistake new fellow you know he said clucking his tongue he said he knew that it was my lifelong dream to build a modern funeral home and to buy a cadillac hearse he said he sympathized with that dream supported it thought the town needed it and thought i deserved it the loan will go through he said drop by and see me this morning after the hearing when i put that phone down it was wet with sweat i couldnt turn that new funeral home down and mr withers knew it my father had raised me on that dream and before he died he made me swear on a bible that i would make it good and here it was on a platter just for a word a word that wouldnt hurt nobody but what about russell hed understand hed have to understand five or ten years from now i told myself he will have forgotten that it ever happened i put on my hat and hurried to the courthouse i was in a hurry to get it over with when they called my name i walked in with my head held high the courtroom was packed the white folks had all the seats and the colored folks were standing in the rear whoever arranged the seating had set aside the first two rows for white men they were sitting almost on top of each other looking mean and uncomfortable in their best white shirts i walked up to the bench and swore on the bible and took a seat mr rivers gave me a little smile and waited for me to get myself set state your name he said booker taliaferro brown i took a quick look at the first two rows and recognized at least ten of the men who killed aaron and your age fiftyseven youre an undertaker yessir you been living in this town all your life yessir you like it here dont you booker was this a threat i looked mr rivers in the face for the first time he smiled i told the truth i said yessir now calling your attention to the day of may th did anything unusual happen on that day the question threw me i shook my head then it dawned on me he was talking about yessir i said thats the day aaron got something in mr rivers face warned me and i pulled up thats the day of the trouble at the train station mr rivers smiled he looked like a trainer whod just put a monkey through a new trick you could feel the confidence and the contempt oozing out of him i looked at his prissy little mustache and his smiling lips and i got mad lifting my head a little bit i looked him full in the eyes i held the eyes for a moment and i tried to tell the man behind the eyes that i was a man like him and that he didnt have no right to be using me and laughing about it but he didnt get the message the bastardhe chuckled softly turned his back to me and faced the audience i believe you were with the preacher that day the water was getting deep i scroonched down in my seat closed the lids of my eyes and looked dense yessir mr rivers i drawled ah was ah was now booker he turned around i believe you tried to keep the nigger preacher from getting out of line i hesitated it wasnt a fair question finally i said yessir you begged him not to go in the white side yessir and when that failed you went over to your sidethe colored side and looked through the window yessir he put his hand in his coat pocket and studied my face you saw everything didnt you just about a muscle on the inside of my thigh started tingling mr rivers shuffled some papers he had in his hand he seemed to be thinking real hard i pushed myself against the back of the chair mr rivers pounced he moved close quick and stabbed his finger into my chest booker did you see the nigger preacher reach for mr sampsons gun he backed away smiling i looked away from him and i felt my heart trying to tear out of my skin i looked out over the courtroom it was still wasnt even a fly moving i looked at the white folks in front and the colored folks in back and i turned the question over in my mind while i was doing that waiting taking my time i noticed out of the corner of my eye that the smile on mr rivers face was dying away suddenly i had a terrible itch to know what that smile would turn into i said nosir mr rivers stumbled backwards like he had been shot old judge sloan took off his glasses and pushed his head out over the bench the whole courtroom seemed to be leaning in to me and i saw aarons widow leaning back with her eyes closed and it seemed to me at that distance that her lips were moving in prayer mr rivers was the first to recover he put his smile back on and he acted like my answer was in the script you mean he said that you didnt see it it happened so quickly that you missed it i looked at the bait and i ain t gonna lie i was tempted he knew as well as i did what i meant but he was gambling on my weakness i had thrown away my funeral home my hearse everything i owned and he was standing there like a magician pulling them out of a hat one at a time dangling them saying looka here looka here dont they look pretty i was on top of a house and he was betting that if he

arms around me it dont take but one booker she said it dont take but one somebody else said they whitewashed it they whitewashed it but you spoiled it for em russell came out then and stood over to the side while the others crowded around to shake my hands then the others sensed that he was waiting and they made a little aisle he walked up to me kind of slowlike and he said thank you sir that was the first time ic his whole  years that that boy had said sir to me i cleared my throat and when i opened my eyes sarah was standing beside me she didnt say nothing she just put her hand in mine and stood there it was long about then i guess when i realized that i was seeing so good  hey say i cried but i dont believe a word of it it was such a hot day and the sun was shining so bright that the sweat rolling down my face blinded me i wiped the sweat out of my eyes and some more people came up and said a lot of foolish things about me showing the white folks and following in aarons footsteps i wasnt doing no such fool thing ol man rivers just put the thing to me in a way it hadnt been put beforeman to man it was simple really any man would have done it  
conakry
by hoyt w fuller
had been in the i republic of guinea r more than a week be fore i decided to do u u  something about a haircut not that my hair had grown so much in that brief span of time it had taken ten days by ocean liner to reach conakry from palma de mallorca and my last visit to the barbers had been a week prior to sailing which meant i was overdue by approximately two weeks for my customary fortnightly trimming in africa it was easy to forget that i needed a haircut african men products of cultures which assign no stigma of inferiority to the texture of their hair find no virtue in cropping it close so thatas is the case with negroes in america it can be brushed or pressed straight with oil or pomade and since most of the local citizens wore their hair long i did not feel overly conscious of the thickening of my hair as i would have in amer ica but i had not forgotten the need entirely for lifelong habits are not so easily abandoned as all that and it was probably natural that i should have found aliounes haircut distracting it was a real airconditioned job perfect for the muggy heat rather thick on top but thin at the sides and rear and among the shaggythatched africans thronging the cramped drinking place it was eyecatching the haircuts wearer was no less arresting than his coiffure he was tall and broadshouldered with full molded features and deepset eyes that gave his handsome face a saturnine air he seemed aloof insofar as that was physically possible standing away from the counter near the wall i saw that the beer in his hand was not the local brew favoredprobably because of its lower priceby most people in the place and i concluded that he was an economic cut above his fellows i was chatting with the proprietor a fat sealmoist frenchman whose disaffection for america and things american bordered on the obsessive on the first evening i  here  as vhrecheeintent pjy   he was wandered into his place seeking some congenial spot where ordinary guineans  congregated he shook his heacmhffioaned dark i ows i  w  k t ly the ame if i represent ion of some  on driving him ?in the midst oiisiippitarangue against barbaric america when he realized that my attention had shifted to the african ah that is alioune he said a fine fellow we are good friends he comes here to talk with me called the african and when the man had made his way to the counter announced rather ambiguously alioune this gentleman is an american   alioune shook hands but said nothing only stared into my face when as a means of ending the unseemly silence i asked of his health he merely replies va bien msieur and continued to stare i suppose that i expected him to ask the usual questionswhy was i in guinea what did i think of it how long would i remain but if he was curious he did not indicate it i was drinking a large bottle of perrier as i always did on my visits to the tavernas i shall call it for the establishment eluded classification if was a sort of combination bartavern and general store a place so unpretentious that it had no name and needed none its facade resembled the rather desolate saloons in hollywood western movies and the interior even less impressive consisted of a huge room divided by a solid weathered counter with a third of the space reserved for customers who had to be served standing up there being no facilities for sitting the remainder of the room was incongruously mostly empty space surrounded by shelves holding a paltry selection of wines tinned foods such household items as soap and oil candy and other confections a doorway at the rear led to an invisible refrigerator where beverages were kept and to the living quarters of the proprietor and his sylphslender darkhaired and wistful wife apart from providing my daily quota of water replenishing that wrung from my pores by the sun the perrier gave me an excuse for calling at the tavern alioune regarded my bottle of water as a healthy man regards the medicines of a hypochondriac and invited me to have a beer thank you very much i said but i wont have any space left for beer after i finish this bottle why do you drink bottled water he asked somewhat suspiciously i explained that my system tended to react unpleasantly and sometimes violently to unaccustomed climates and water and that i felt the mineral water was wiser under the circumstances that explanation did not take into account the influence of many warnings of the dire consequences of drinking unboiled water in africa but it was substantially truthful  the proprietor leaning over the counter shook his tousled dusty gray head and laughed he is so american he said to alioune the american black people are more american than the americans it was a marvelous statement loaded with terrible accusations against some eighteen million americans the most serious charge being that they lay claim to a heritage that is not their own it is an indictment bom of the fact of the alienation and degradation of american negroes but it fails to consider another fact that is at least as inescapablethat whether happily or regrettably it is as impossible to separate negroes from the complex entity that is america as it is to isolate the yeast from bread but it was easy to overlook these misconceptions in a foreigner when they are shared by so many americans who have no excuse for not knowing better but the implication that there was something uniquely indicative in an americans drinking a beverage that is bottled and widely sold in france and her dependent territories was frankly puzzling i said so ah you americans are so antiseptic the frenchman declared you are like women afraid of a few germs the frenchman was grinding an ax and it was useless to expect reason from him so i left his remark unchallenged when he moved off to attend to business i told alioune that i liked his haircut and asked if he would tell me where he had gotten it alioune regarded me speculatively the african barbershop is not very modern he said after a moment perhaps you would prefer a european barbershop not particularly i replied with some surprise i thought i would like a haircut similar to yours he nodded neutrally the barbershop is near the gare de voitures behind the hotel monkarin i said i had not the slightest idea where that was and he nodded again if you are free now i will show you we called out goodbye to the frenchman and maneuvered through the sweatscented mob to the door alioune led the way up the dusty street making no effort to converse answering my questions with elaborate economy of words near the boulevard du niger he pointed to a shop sandwiched between a jewelers and a bootmakers a sign reading coiffeur pour messieurs over the door perhaps you want this european shop msieur it is said that american black men do not prefer the society of africans you will be more comfortable here i would like to see your shop if you dont mind i persisted i refrained from asserting that i had traveled thousands of miles to seek the society of africans we continued past the hotel du niger across the tip of the aromatic market now almost deserted in the approaching dusk and down a wide street flanked on one side by the rear wall of the massive market building and on the other by a series of clothing shops these shops owned by middle easterners all seemed to be stocked with duplicate merchandise they featured during business hours small platoons of african men who sat out front at desks or behind machines sewing on the spot the garments sold inside their productstrousers shirts and blue and white moslem bouboushung from racks beneath the porticoes at the end of the street situated in a tiny plaza stood the threestory hotel monkarin a dusty ochrecolored building reminiscent of a chicago flophouse behind it was the gare du voitures an openair garage and service station attended by idle dandies and garrulous motorcar afficionados alioune said nothing until we crossed the street behind the hotel and stood on the edge of the premises of the gare de voitures it is here he said then indicating a structure directly in front of us he had turned so that he was looking squarely in my face measuring my reaction my attempt at suppressing my disappointment was hardly successful i had not expected an establishment that compared with the european barbershop but i was unprepared for what i saw the building could be charitably described as a leanto about half the size of a onecar garage through the open door most of the interior was visible a long shelf along the rear wall held several pieces of mirror and a variety of powders lotions combs and brushes the shelf as well as the floor was covered with dust of at least several days accumulation and hair layered the floor like a ragged carpet there were three chairs each presently occupied and three busy barbers and several men sat on benches in the corners awaiting their turns alioune gestured for me to enter and i stepped inside momentarily forgetting my own six feet plus and striking my head against the low ceiling as a consequence alioune spoke to the center barber apparently the manager and he stopped work to greet us this is an american gentleman alioune presented me he would like a haircut all faces turned to regard me i straightened slightly from my stooped stance trying to appear less ridiculous than i felt the barber saluted me politely told me he would personally cut my hair and asked that i take a seat on the bench and wait a few moments i told him that i had not the time for a haircut as it was growing late and that i would return the following day it was a lame excuse and i had a mental picture of aliounes nod of satisfaction behind my back very well msieur the barber said how much is a haircut i asked one hundred and fifty francs msieur i thanked the barber and stepped outside again there alioune and i shook hands exchanged formal pleasantries and went off in opposite directions the smug expression never left his face i did not meet alioune in the tavern again until two evenings later in the meantime i continued the practice of dropping in for a perrier morning and evening during the day the proprietor worked as building contractor in the surrounding area and madame ran the business with the help of a boy who sold ice from the shed adjoining the tavern many customers were women and children some of whom spoke little or virtually no french one of these was a morosefaced girl of eight or nine a bean pole of a child who regularly sauntered in bearing on her head a basket of roundedup bottles for which she insisted on being paid as she plumped them one at a time on the counter when as often happened madame refused to accept a bottle explaining that it had not come from her place the child flew into a tantrum flinging her thin arms and stamping her bare feet and screaming in soussou invariably the tantrum ran its futile course and she retired to a corner to nurse her unsalable bottles fondle her precious francs and sulk madame was as patient as a schoolmarm with difficult customers sometimes almost affectionately so there was a pair of winos who particularly drew her sympathy the men never seemed to work and yet they always had the price of some measure of a bottle of wine madame bantered amiably with them for as long as they were lucid and continued to indulge them when they no longer were the older man a moonfaced softeyed toma whoin his youth had traveled to serra leone and liberia spoke some english and offered to be my guide an offer he was in no condition to fulfill he never eats madame said of him rather like a fond but despairing mother he gets his only nourishment from wine the younger man a cocoacolored mulatto with wavy black hair and a face like a battered matinee idol affected imperious airs as a rule he spoke only to madame and when she was busy elsewhere talked to himself in a deeply modulated tone and in impeccable french toward evening the taverns limited space for customers swelled with workers having a quick beer on the way home or others already spruced up and out on the town it was a masculine assemblage but women occasionally infiltrated it a familiar female interloper was a tall silent soussou woman who appeared for a nightly beer with her baby laced to her back she never talked but stood apart at the wall and leisurely drank her beer there were however visits from less retiring ladies one of the least reticent was a middleaged north african woman a great partisan of wine who liked to regale prospective clients with tales of her sexual prowess her favorite fable involving no less a personage than the president of the republic he chose me she boasted brandishm ing her wine bottle at me and contorting her tattooed face in a yellowtoothed grimace intended to be seductive me the arab sekou toure came to my house i have proof i still have the thousandfranc note he gave me the proprietor usually arrived with the first surge of workers and leaving his helpers to unload the truck in front of the tavern joined madame behind the counter wet and soiled with sweat and grime he wore on these occasions a blue demin work shirt unbuttoned and khaki shorts over which his white belly hung and under which dropped gross legs unsightly with bluish lumps and varicose veins he scurried about between the counter and the refrigerator in the rear distributing cold beer collapsing winded on the counter during a lull in the rush of business he was in such an exhausted state gasping for breath but already launched in a denunciation of the moneygrasping americans when alioune came in relieved i welcomed the african with perhaps exaggerated warmth a warmth to which he was not receptive he seemed in fact more taciturn than before when his glance kept rising to my head i realized why you did not get a haircut msieur he said at length i have been very busy i said not altogether untruthfully alioune nodded knowingly when the frenchman went to fetch his beer he said why do you not go to the white mans barbershop you will like that better that is not necessarily true i said braking my annoyance at his smugness my hair is like yours and the african will know how to cut it however this reply did not get at the root of the tension i added you astonish me alioune what you have been told about american negroes is a lot of nonsense we do not prefer white people to africans we are anxious to know africans there simply has not been very much opportunity in the past alioune allowed himself a wry smile butfor the momentsaid nothing more when the frenchman returned with his beer he motioned toward the shelves above the untidy gray head the magazine he said the proprietor said ah as if anticipation of some imminent delight reached up andextracted a dogeared copy of a popular american weekly from a shelf he gave the magazine to alioune who placed it on the counter before me it had lain folded and he passed his hand over the creased slick paper so that it would lie flat the page to which the magazine was opened was soiled suggesting that it had been handed about print the text of a serial story covered most of the page and there was a column of advertisements on one side and a twocolumn cartoon at the bottom alioune pointed to the cartoon i looked down at the cartoon it showed a group of the thicklipped grassskirted spearwielding africans hovering hungrily about a large spot in which two pithhelmeted white man were being cooked my first impulse was to laugh for it was an amusing cartoon but the inclination toward levity was checked by my consciousness of aliounes seriousness and by the sudden awareness of the insidious influence at work on him when i looked up again aliounes eyes flared with accusation we are not savages msieur he said in a calm voice that only accentuated his smoldering fury my glance shifted along with my thoughts from alioune to the frenchman he was there leaning on the counter beaming over aliounes shoulder like some rolypoly mephisto after breakfast the following morning i hurried off to the barbershop while courage was fresh i had been invited by m debaste chief of the conakry base of fria the multimilliondollar international aluminum mining combine to dine in the firms eighthfloor penthouse that night several government ministers were to be on hand and i thought it appropriate to make my appearance as decent as possible a haircut would serve that purpose even if it made no contribution toward placating alioune on entering the shack i saw that the cloak of dust of two days before had not been disturbed and that fresh nap had been added to the hair rug on the floor the manager was busy and assuming there could not be so much difference i took the vacant chair on his left it was presided over by a thin ferretfaced young man as bafflingly neat and starched as the barbershop was disorderly and dusty the barber proceeded to chat as barbers will but i said very little preferring that he give all his attention to his work he snipped away rapidly enough perhaps a shade too rapidly and i several times cautioned him against taking off too much hair oui oui msieur je comprends he assured me each time and went on snipping with abandon when finally he presented me the fragmented mirror to view the finished job i was appalled my head looked as if a brood of angry hens had been scratching about in it is it as msieur wished the barber asked solicitously the scissors poised i quickly answered that it would have to do i thought it inadvisable to risk having him attempt to repair it for he might worsen it nature would fill in the gaps in the next few days the barber dusted by head and neck with talcum and i climbed out of the chair the manager regarded me with sympathy how much i asked merely as routine the barber hedged glanced undereyed at the manager and replied sotto voce cinq cents francs how much i demanded raising my voice it was incredible that he would ask five hundred francs for the mess he had made of my hair cinq cents francs he repeated in a more subdued voice than before i turned to the manager and asked very loudly what did you tell me the other day was the price of a haircut one hundred and fifty francs msieur he said apologetically i gave the scissor manipulator the correct fee and hurried off to the hotel to wash my head reflecting en route on the tenuousness of the bonds of brotherhood it was several days later when i next encountered alioune the dinner at fria and an interview with president toure already behind me the haircut had not failed to entertain m debaste and his guests and even the president i had rather looked forward to confronting alioune with the barbers attempt to swindle me thinking this might demonstrate that his own people were as capable of unfraternal attitudes as he imagined mine were but first i did a models whirl so that he could view the haircut fore and aft well i got my hair cut at your shop i said it is not very good alioune replied did the proprietor serve you no i said he was busy but the one who performed this job asked five hundred francs for it what do you think of that he showed no surprise did you pay it of course not then do not blame him you have more money than he does it is only logical that he ask what he thinks you will pay the frenchman who had been listening found the whole exchange hilarious he broke into uproarious laughter that was i suspected more affected than genuine ah you see you do not understand how they think we know the africans we live with them you are a white american in black skin aliounes cavernous eyes were fixed on my face he smiled slightly slyly as if in agreement with what the frenchman said 
the ghetto game
by dennis clark
ne of the most notable factors affecting the movement of negroes and other people of color in the urban centers has     been the persistence of residential belts and islands of vs e ethnic groups in the older neighborhoods these concentrated ethnic groups have greatly influenced opinion and expectations about minorities historically the immigrant foreignlanguage groups established the american form of the ghetto pattern in the large cities their segregation was partly forced but partly voluntary permitting exit for those who were amenable to assimilation with the general population these ethnic enclaves with their traditionally inferior living conditions were the matrix for later and larger negro segregation areas when the great negro migration to the cities began around world war i the ethnic groups were a very considerable portion of the urban population in  the foreignbom represented   of our population as late as  the central cities had very considerable percentages of foreignborn population the foreignborn in some of the major cities and the nonwhite populations with which they were in juxtaposition were foreign born  nonwhite new york   chicago   los angeles   philadelphia   detroit   boston   the proximity of nonwhites and the foreignborn when it did not yield an uneasy tolerance produced confused resentment and hostility the happy fourth of july picture of hearty cocitizenship among all groups is misleading while a practical tolerance usually functions the attitudes and opinions underlying it are crude and well laced with antagonism although many immigrants have relaxed racial feelings others have for years replenished the ranks of the raceconscious immigrants from the old world were no doubt tutored in the fine points of racial distinction by the native americans those with foreignborn ties were usually no less susceptible to prejudice and racial antagonism than the nativeborn citizens of long standing their concentration in ethnic pockets gave ample social expression to their willingness to reject intrusion and adhere to group loyalties these groups became key factors in shaping the course of negro movement through urban residential areas in many places they rebuffed nonwhite entry into their areas or deflected it to other neighborhoods at times they formed walls of resistance to nonwhite movement or became swift evaders of nonwhite infiltration by moving away in concerted and disciplined fashion the ethnic communities of the large cities have constituted an obstacle course through which the nonwhites have had to move now displacing now surrounding now outflanking the immigrant islands and foreignlanguage concentrations obstacle course the primary consideration of the relationship of foreignlanguage communities to nonwhite population is that the immigrant neighborhoods have usually been physically contiguous or in opposition to nonwhite concentrations the negro and the foreignlanguage immigrant shared the limitations of income that forced them both to accept the older housing in the areas close to the center of the city for the negro this condition was more enduring he remained confined often while a succession of foreignborn groups came and went through the old neighborhoods this physical proximity is important it meant that the two types of minority groups racial and lingual were often in competition for the same shabby tenements and backstreet houses the foreignborn groups were often accustomed from their european background to working within circumscribed physical conditions their diligence and ingenuity would be lavished upon tiny areas that however poor they seemed by general american standards still represented relative comfort and security for the immigrant as the foreignbom groups thinned out they tended to shrink their concentrations or yield territory to others growing negro population often filled the abandoned irish italian or slavic areas but in order for the negro to gain access to the general channels of urban movement he frequently had to overcome or somehow bypass a traditionrooted core of immigrant residence these immigrant communities served as barriers against negro mobility for the rest of the city population examples of such roadblocks to negro movements could be seen in st louis around  where germans jews poles and italians bordered the negro district west of the mississippi the polish principality of hamtramck in detroit has for years been impenetrable by negroes the ethnic ghettos along franklin street in north philadelphia have long prevented the eastward movement of negroes the physical confrontation of the negro and the white minority groups has been fraught with social factors that bedevilled the relationship the foreignborn were often not sure of themselves at all in their new urban environment many were unused to democracy and its concepts of social and racial equality upon achieving some status in this new country they felt they could not afford to have it undermined by mixing with the stigmatized nonwhite group although at times sensitive to discrimination themselves they were in too precarious a social position to let this permit a softening in their own attitude toward the nonwhites the foreignbom groups were beset with many internal conflicts and it was an easy response to direct hostility against the nonwhites the social conflicts and tensions accompanying the process of adjustment of the foreignbom to urban life tended to produce crime and delinquency which sometimes became a behavior pattern within the groups this turbulence became exceedingly dangerous when radical incidents took place to the tightly knit foreignbom groups the negro was often a strange and dreadful creature they would have less knowledge of him than even the native white american he would not be another european like the rest of the minorities he would not have the elaborate rituals and customs of the europeans but would seem to defy any cultural definition as a competitor for jobs space and facilities he was a threat it is evident then that among the group antagonisms in american cities the relationship between the negro and the foreignborn presented special difficulties but this is all in the past it was acted out in the early part of the century some would say this is too facile a judgment the foreignbom communities have been tenacious some have thrived for generations in addition to the foreignborn persons in these groups the second and thirdgeneration offspring are often strongly identified with ethnic ties    the information that follows should be in no way construed as indicative of any thoroughgoing social malady in the groups discussed these groups all have remarkable qualities and have made remarkable contributions to american life their difficulties with the racial question though more severe or more immediate because of their physical proximity to negrooccupied areas are part of the more general vexation of our society on this issue we will look then at some of the groups whose position in the urban demographic pattern exposes them to the test of tolerance on race relations the poles people with race relations experienced contend that polish neighborhoods are particularly resistant to racial change and are likely to react violently to incursions by nonwhites areas of polish immigrant or other slavic concentration have been the scenes of some of the most notable outbursts ot racial violence in northern cities violence in detroit is often ascribed to polish elements as were outbreaks in cicero illinois adjacent to chicago the poles are noted as a highly individualistic people a people caught in historic contradictions the history of the mother country may be very significant in explaining the polish attitude toward group relationships in this country polands shifting borders and political life have embraced a number of traditionally hostile ethnic and nationality groups within poland there have been in modern times a variety of populations coexisting in uneasy polity lithuanians estonians germanspeaking elements ukrainians white russians jews and various balkan strains have lived in polish territory intermittently the poles have had a difficult  time to look at it from their viewpoint with a long historical succession of fiery separatist unyielding foreignlanguage and ethnic minorities this accounts for some of the furious quality of polish nationalism with such a legacy of intergroup difficulty it is not surprising that poles did not come to the polyglot american city with a bland attitude toward minority neighbors in the new world in the great monument of research on the poles the polish peasant in europe and america thomas and znaniecki point out a distinctive feature of polish immigrant life they note that the poles formed their mutual aid societies and social and fraternal groups before they concentrated residentially this is important it means that there was an especially deliberate character to polish residential concentration it did not take place in such a random fashion as that of other groups while it was no doubt subject to the general exigencies of immigrant settlement there was more consultation direction and group influence in the choices that formed the polish communities thus the polish neighborhood is less of an accident and more of a group bastion than the neighborhoods of most other immigrants moreover polish families usually devote a great deal of energy and thrift to the care of dwellings the house is a family project and all share in its improvement in such areas as detroits hamtramck which has stood as an allwhite area adjacent to negro concentrations for years the steady improvement of the housing is a tribute to the hard work of immigrant families the reaction of such families to the encroachment of negroes whose residential history has been one of privation is strongly resentful the rough caliber of this resentment is described by one commentator on big city life the poles who for the most part live in neighborhoods that have not yet been entered by negro families are said to be determined to resist with violence if necessary any negro invasion of the areas they inhabit political committeemen in polish neighborhoods have vocally associated themselves with this attitude as a minority group the poles have not fared as well in the american immigrant sweepstakes as others bogue points that the secondgeneration poles in the united states have actually a lower socioeconomic status than the first generation poles have also remained in a position near the bottom of the social distance scale a device drawn up by social scientists to reflect prevalent ethnic preferences in terms of educational attainment the poles rank low among immigrant groups in this country the jews and irish do well in increasing the level of school years completed between first and second generation italians and others complete fewer years in school these factors would certainly have an influence upon the race relations of the group deprivation of social status would heighten the likelihood that poles would feel a need for a scapegoat the negro would be present and often in a position to compete with the pole for jobs and other opportunities the lower educational achievement of the pole would increase the possibility of unthinking and pugnacious responses to racial change because the percentage of polishborn persons in the population will decrease rapidly in coming years and because residential mobility will continue to erode the old polishoccupied neighborhoods the acuteness of the racial problem with respect to this group is likely to diminish since the poles are a predominantly roman catholic group the gradual but pervasive catholic moral concern for the elimination of racial inequities will have an affect as the educational level of people of polish background rises the italians of all immigrant groups the italians are most symbolic for the twentieth century of the great american experience of immigration of the major immigration groups they were the last great wave to arrive from europe in the tens of thousands their arrival was the denouement of the tremendous atlantic migration they seemed to enact the drama of building an urban ethnic world in american cities with a zestful enthusiasm numerically the italianborn are our largest foreignborn group their concentrations in the little italys in the various cities are still very much with us the italian neighborhoods are some of our most striking examples of ethnic aggregation today if we omit negro neighborhoods from consideration the italian neighborhoods with their accompanying churches fraternal lodges italian food shops and gregarious family life have not been confined to older largecity areas many smaller industrial towns in the east fruitgrowing areas on the west coast and foodprocessing centers have strong italian communities we are most concerned however with the italianoccupied areas adjoining negro districts these older neighborhoods usually derived their italian character from the first waves of immigration from southern italy beginning in the s and reaching its height in the early years of this century the tide ebbed after world war i the exhaustion of the sicilian sulphur mines the demise of feudal estates with political change the great disaster of the blight of the grapevines and the hope for a better life in america brought tens of thousands of italians to our urban areas at times the immigrants were recruited for american industry by agents in italy employment was found in railroad construction the garment trades the building trades and food industries  one striking feature of the italian residential blocks has been the housing improvements that have taken place under private initiative the extensive engagement of italians in building trades meant that the families usually had valuable skills available the men could cut stone lay brick and cement and do a great number of things by way of physical improvement of homes and shops and significantly they could do these things themselves well enough to be proud of the results owing to the association of negroes with shabby and deteriorated houses the financial and emotional investment of the italian householder was felt to be in jeopardy when negroes encroached also the italian neighborhood has been steadily replenished by secondand thirdgeneration offspring strong family ties induce a number of the younger families to stay within walking distance of parents and grand parents the beloved nona the winemaking grandfather the generous uncle or godparent are just too wellaccepted and compatible to desert large families in small houses mean that the young will seek the outdoors in cities this means the street comer or some familiar sandwich shop in the italian neighborhoods the pizza shops and the soda fountain hangouts are the scenes for second and thirdgeneration streetcorner society it is in the relations of juvenile groups that antagonism between negroes and white immigrant groups often flares up the case of italian youths will be cited here not because it is peculiar to them but because there are good examples of friction in italian neighborhoods in the case files of interracial and intergroup relations agencies a further complication to the racial issue may be a latin concept of personal honor which requires an injury to be avenged this would increase the possibility of hostile exchange in  and early  two cities provided examples of incidents involving italians and negroes the incidents were largely independent of one another but their combined impact on the respective italian and negro groups should be considered carefully because the outbreaks formed a clear sequence in popular opinion in philadelphia in may  a high school boy john campigla was killed by a wolf pack attack of negro youths the killing was utterly senseless and the victim utterly innocent public opinion in the italian community was inflamed a series of small fights and a retaliatory shotgun attack took place shortly afterward in the same section of the city fortunately the shotgun blast only slightly injured a negro girl on the steps of a baptist church in june  a young policeman named marinelli was called to a melee in a heavily negro area of north philadelphia he leaned from the door of his patrol wagon and fired his gun repeatedly at a fleeing man he killed not only the man but a woman near him both victims were negro both were innocent of any offense negro community opinion was outraged in february  while the trial of the killers of john campiglia was in progress the son of a civic leader in south philadelphia named ianelli was beaten by a teenage gang of negroes the boys father had been a worker for better race relations in march  a teenager named cerone was stabbed by negro boys after a basketball game the wound resulting in paralysis in the same month an emotionally disturbed italian warbride wife of a negro in an integrated community attracted public notice by placing antinegro signs around her home and engaging in other antinegro activity these incidents with the publicity attending them formed a pattern for the italian and negro groups their effect was to add fuel to smoldering hostility and to start a chainreaction of aggravating incidents which heightened the possibility of a general outbreak     these incidents are typical of the violence that plagues the relationship between ethnic groups the events are usually given sensationalized coverage in the general press as well as being reported in the italian and spanishlanguage papers and the negro press people conscious of ethnic identity take sides connecting the incidents with a special kind of rivalry the chance of retaliation is increased by the proximity of the groups such series of events are common in the large cities the hostility thus generated may come to a head at any time to provide the tinder form thus generated may come to a head at any time to provide the tinder for largescale racial violence fortunately for blessed but obscure reasons it seldom does the jews jewish people are wise in the ways of cities they have for centuries been an urban people time after time they have seen racial antagonism mount in city streets it is improbable however that they have ever encountered on such a large scale the kind of problem presented by the urbanization of the american negro the entire social life of the modern city is momentously different from that of the past in the past population movement was slow today there is swift movement resulting in an almost random mixture of people from various backgrounds in metropolitan centers in this setting the large jewish populations of the major northern cities are involved in a very distinctive way in the nations struggle to resolve the american dilemma of race relations one of the places in which negroes confront jews is the corner store in many of the great segregated districts the last outposts of white residence are the groceries small drygoods stores and pharmacies which are in many cases owned and operated as family businesses by modestly prosperous jewish people because of their economic stake in these small businesses the owners have frequently been reluctant to leave areas which have changed racially in segregated neighborhoods where the earning power and standard of living are often depressed these little stores fit intimately into neighborhood life they are flexible enough to meet the irregular needs of informal local and family living in overcrowded negro districts the streetcorner society which affords an outlet to the young centers around such small businesses  m in these circumstances the jewish storekeeper is often the only white man many negroes see on a regular basis he is a person who gives service but often he is also a family creditor to whom the grocery bill is owed the amount of antisemitism that may grow out of this latter relationship is surprising as the last white resident on the block in sections where existence is less than genteel it is understandable that small shopkeepers should at times feel the pressure of minoritygroup frustration and counterprejudice a second sphere of influence in which negroes and jews interact is in those heavily jewish neighborhoods that have begun to change racially the sequence of migrations of minority groups through our cities has often placed negroes next in line to jews in social status and homebuying ability neighborhoods once forbidden to jews have received substantial influxes of jewish home owners because of geographical convenience or economic accessibility these same neighborhoods are now attractive to nonwhite home buyers the aspiring negro sees in these areas the same virtues of middleclass respectability that jewish families fresh from the immigrant jewtowns saw in them a generation ago perhaps there is also some basis for supposing that the liberal opinion prominent in bigcity jewish circles and the traditionally nonviolent disposition of jews exert an attraction on negroes seeking a way out of segregated neighborhoods in neighborhoods where jews form a very substantial portion of the poulation there has been no marked deviation from the general pattern of response to negro newcomers essentially the white reaction remains the same the likelihood of violence is at a minimum but the development of panic and gradual white withdrawal is the usual course community leadership sympathetic toward racial integration does seem to be more frequent in such areas but this does not change the eventual outcome the promotion of interracial understanding still comes too little and too late to be of any practical significance there are other influences that seem to make neighborhoods with heavy jewish populations susceptible to racial turnover for many jewish families long in the urban tradition the processes of property exchange contain no mystery they enter without hesitation into real estate transactions when the question arises of leaving a changing neighborhood in addition in a group keenly preoccupied with education the coming of negroes to the public school seems in the light of racial stereotypes like a blow to the educational advantages and prospects of jewish children other factors permitting greater mobility are the small size of jewish families and the relatively high proportion of jews who live in apartments instead of owning houses in any event the middleclass status of the bulk of the jewish population usually assures some assets with which to negotiate a property sale the problem of a synagogue in a racially changing area should also be noted unlike many christian denominations the jews do not proselytize the synagogue congregation can not absorb incoming negro families the way a correctly oriented roman catholic or a congregational or methodist church can and reduction in the congregation due to the removal of a jewish family is likely to be permanent if a sufficient proportion of the congregation migrates it may be economically mandatory for the temple to follow this is one reason for the growth of the echo ghetto in the suburbs the old downtown congregation reforms in the new area the third sphere in which negroes and jews are particularly linked is not so much physical as it is one of social psychology the negro and jew are both members of a minority group that experienced a sour tolerance or actual illtreatment on the american scene this fact has brought forth a sort of kinship or practical affinity between jews and negroes based on their common concern for fair treatment and democratic rights hence jewish and negro organizations can usually be found working together for civil_rights fair employment intergroup understanding and racial integration many jewish groups devote more effort to bettering race relations than to any other object    the american jew shares actively in the economic abundance that has been the nations harvest for the last fifteen years he walks with nonjews as leader organization man and laborer in the economic activities of the day he inhabits suburbia and plays a vigorous role both as producer and consumer the negro by contrast is just beginning to emerge from an economic limbo his family income job status savings and property ownership are all below the national average for whites and nobody really knows how much of the recent progress of negroes in these areas has been achieved at the expense of such sacrifices as the employment of mothers and the postponement of medical and educational needs in social organization we perceive once again a great disparity between jew and negro jews have an enviable apparatus of fraternal charitable and civic organizations manned by articulate and effective leaders negroes are still suffering from the paucity of leadership that has been a traditional characteristic of depressed ethnic groups arriving on the urban scene men like martin_luther_king are exceptional in any group the ability of a group to train and consistently present skilled leadership is slowgrowing leadership in effective force does not rise out of a vacuum it must have preconditions of education organized tradition a degree of leisure and concourse with the elites of power and learning    an examination of the relationship between the negro and the jew in the light of the social factors mentioned above indicates that there is a considerable social gap between the two groups in spite of the bond of sympathy they share one of the practical effects of this situation is that jews are often placed under extreme pressures when they face up to racial issues often jewish people solidly supporting liberal race relations practices and programs feel genuinely repelled by the social differences persisting in the negro population when racial integration confronts them and they are brought face to face with the contrasts between the great bulk of the newly urbanized negro population and their own established middle class thus jews do seem to have a special problem with respect to racial change puerto ricans although puerto rican migration to the mainland has not brought about a great dispersion of spanishspeaking people generally through the eastern cities it has resulted in strong puertorican concentrations in the old neighborhoods of philadelphia chicago bridgeport and above all new york the influx has thus placed the puerto ricans in some of the major urban centers which are today vast laboratories of social tension and racial change placed beside american negroes or intermingled with them the puerto ricans have been very confused in their racial attitudes their hispanic background has endowed them with a rather casual attitude toward race this attitude is subtle in the mainland cities the keen consciousness of race among the general population forces puerto ricans to question their own tradition in racial matters and frequently to adopt a more decisive attitude towards racial differences in response to the mainland abberrations but this is done with much inner confusion racial distinctions in puerto rico are mild but they are there the spanish terms of el bianco white el indio dark skin with straight hair el grijo white coloring but with hair or features of a negroid cast el bien triguena a fairer negro and the use of the term el negro as a word of opprobrium reflect the differing values ascribed to racial visibility on the island within the puerto rican group however particularly in puerto rico color is inconsequential in social relations in families there will sometimes be a subtle feeling of status difference based on color between siblings but this is seldom serious on the mainland this attitude of casual acceptance can suddenly become starkly challenged and the emotional impact on family life and personal awareness can be tremendous the acute ingroup feeling and loyalty in the puerto rican communities induces the hispanos to reject the american negro on double grounds first as an outsider and second as a symbol of and a target for racial discrimination with which it would be unwise to be identified the spanishspeaking puerto rican of dark color is fraternally treated except perhaps on the mainland where there is question of intimate or permanent relationshipsbut the american negro is an interloper a threat a puzzle the fact that similar disabilities afflict both groups in many ways only heightens the puerto ricans resentment against the american negro thus puerto ricans may resent appeals against prejudice and discrimination which link american negroes and hispanos puerto ricans in new york and elsewhere have been harbingers of racial change in east harlem the bronx and brooklyn they have preceded negro entries having the puerto ricans in the role of precursors has not noticeably slowed the classic white response of withdrawal upon negro influx in the mainland cities the relations between american negroes and puerto ricans have commonly been strained with juvenile fights the most frequent expression of this antagonism the tension seems greatest with respect to newly arrived puerto ricans there is some moderation of hostility as the groups reside in the same area over a period of time small groups will become friends and establish ties casually in the second or third generation but the barrier to intimate association will usually remain there is the old area competition between the two groups for jobs and housing the negro resents the arrival of the puerto rican to work for lower pay puerto ricans who open small shops and stores accuse negroes of being stupid or lazy because they have in the main been slow to build such businesses any advances made by hispanos are subject to criticism by negroes because the puerto rican not born on the mainland and speaking a foreign language is successful at the expense of negroes while hispanos and negroes may resent one another their residential association is constantly enforced the puerto ricans are recently arrived in the cities and so are many southern negroes landlords are seldom capable of according the groups separate status although the language factor may make property rental more difficult for the hispanos the distinction and separation is made at the insistence of the puerto ricans who tend to choose dwellings removed from negro occupancy so far as this is possible in areas crowded by the adjacent groups perhaps the chief factor separating the two groups besides the consciousness of color is a difference in attitudes about sex and the family at the neighborhood level this is extremely important for the residential world is a domestic one the hispano family is extended proud and has a careful code of behavior and relationships prescribed by long tradition the negro family is nuclear weakened by many longterm influences and informal in its relationships in the puerto rican family the male has high status in the negro family the woman has so often been breadwinner that she is the main figure puerto ricans resent the easy approach to women that mainland negroes may exhibit for puerto ricans the woman is guarded by a protective supervision of attitudes and customs hence there is a subtle strategy of withdrawal among the spanishspeaking families which evades advances by american negroes even though life may be proceeding on a friendly basis the negro who may have encountered promiscuous contacts between puerto rican males and american negro women sees no reason why the compliment shouldnt be returned by puerto rican women especially since many may be just as dark as he is there are other divergences in churches and in recreation some commentators state that integration of the mainland negroes and puerto ricans is far away the two groups will continue to share the worst of the housing supply with the puerto rican frequently unable to escape identification with the negro although residential segregation of necessity will operate less precisely in the case of some spanishspeaking because they are not readily identifiable as colored the puerto rican will continue to be the alter ego of the mainland negro in residential matters the negro neighborhoods adjoining the white minority communities have an ambiguous set of attitudes toward their distant neighbors on the one hand the immigrants are subject to some discrimination as is the negro in some ways relationships may be casual and unprejudiced negroes may shop in the curbside italian markets or go to school with puerto ricans or realize that jewish organizations are prointegration on the other hand there will be a recognition that the immigrants do constitute a group by themselves with their own exclusive clubs and programs and the negro will know that acquiring a house in the immigrant area will mean trouble for the negro population the significance of the white immigrant as a member of a minority group tends to be obscured by the simple fact that the immigrant is white thereby sharing the negative characteristics of the stereotyped white person so common in the thinking of negroes it is frequently observed by native negroes with some bitterness that they are denied opportunities which the foreignborn can easily obtain the resettlement of hungarian refugees after the disorders in that country in  aroused resentment in negro circles as they saw it persons who had made no contribution to this country were fussed over by the government and resettled in good houses in good neighborhoods negroes couldnt occupy those same houses without bringing the scorching wrath of their fellow citizens down on their heads on succeeding some immigrant population in an area negroes often find that the housing is owned by a number of absentee landlords of the previous immigrant group the negro families may face rent gouging and other forms of exploitation and their attitude toward the group represented by the landlords may become hostile the activities of immigrant savings and loan societies which control property or immigrant fraternal groups who purchase property to keep it out of the hands of negroes produce the same kind of negative reaction the muslim and black nationalist groups which have been widely publicized in recent years are not averse to singling out jews and other groups for special indictment in race relations these negro extremist cults do not represent any large segment of negro opinion but their arguments in this matter will usually be listened to with care by a great number of negroes who may be familiar with the racial thinking of white ethnic groups as the inquirer proceeds to the more educated levels of negro life however he finds that the commitment of negroes to tolerance and interracial fellowship offsets bad experiences the informed and intelligent negro seldoms singles out particular white ethnic groups for criticism in racial matters but tends to argue in terms of the white population as a whole native whites although we have concentrated our attention upon foreignborn groups in this chapter it should not be inferred that cohesive nativeborn neighborhoods are not a frequent source of trouble the problems arising from neighborhoods with a high percentage of appalachian mountaineers have been of considerable concern in some cities cities with a high homeownership rate where neighborhoods are stable and the population relatively settled produce the phenomenon of entrenched burghers with practically no immigrant ties who yet vigorously oppose racial change such areas are not nearly so troublesome as immigrant locales but they indicate that it is not so much immigrant peculiarities as the fundamental sense of group cohesion which threatens social harmony in racial situations the population elements deriving from the old immigration of the early nineteenth century have of course been deeply enmeshed in the traditions of racial exclusion and restriction whatever our estimate of the reactions of new immigrant groups we must not forget that these groups have been entering into an american stream of social opinion in which racism was a strong current the upperclass and middleclass neighborhoods of the succesful old immigration elements were the models for the newer arrivals there are forces at work in nativeborn neighborhoods that on occasion can produce agitated waves of racial feeling although such areas seldom hold the same violence potential as immigrant communities the insecurity of the junior executive suburb is an example in a suburb of organization man families the corporations that control the jobs of the breadwinners may transfer a household head to another city on short notice hence the home owners are extremely sensitive to anything which would make the selling of their houses more difficult the presence of negroes in the area is such a factor this junior executive difficulty was thought to be one of the reasons why the suburban town of deerfield illinois reacted with hostility to a plan to erect a limited number of attractive homes for interracial occupancy nearby another reaction in nativeborn old immigration areas in recent years has been the product of a decline into minority status on the part of formerly predominant groups oldline white protestant communities in large cities where the populations are increasingly catholic and negro are beginning to display all marks of minority psychology they feel hemmed in discriminated against objects of the illwill of the growing negro and catholic elements security and selfpossessed assurance are beginning to wane under the impact of metropolitan population mobility and changes in the urban power structure even though many of the oldline neighborhoods and suburbs are not yet confronted with racial change they have had to admit jews italians and a variety of other formerly proscribed groups having been nudged this far the oldline residents have begun to fear that the next step racial change is inevitable this is a reaction that is not found among the hardier new immigrants who are often ready to contest each street in their area the shifting population of the urban centers will alter the residential makeup in the central city areas only vestiges of the immigrant communities will remain for some years yet however these communities will have a special significance for race relations in most of the larger cities the municipal intergroup relations agencies have representation from the different ethnic groups on their boards or in staffs this at least permits some communication with the groups so that when conflict situations or severe tensions arise there can be consultation and the exertion of accepted leadership to avoid outbreaks or the continuation of hostility formal representation of ethnic groups on those civic bodies committed to peace and fair play increases the possibility that mutual respect will be maintained the leadership of each group is loath to be stigmatized as irresponsible or incendiary in the eyes of the other group such a formula for civic peace in the diversified urban community can be effective if it is well administered and serviced with an adequate program of information conference and involvement of representative opinion leaders but if the formula is mere windowdressing a coalition of ethnic leaders for mutual admiration and egogratification or for the sake of political display then the city that permits such a fraud may find its peace broken and its minority group relations poisoned by antagonism the day of immigrant neighborhoods may be fading fast but these areas have had a strategic significance in the last two decades in their effect upon nonwhite urban movement they represent a notable interlude in intergroup relations the lessons we can learn from them should not be readily forgotten
