black muslims
by calvin c hernton
hen it comes to that w y zone of our lives where  black meets white the oa«« north has aiways imagined himself as some kind of eternal liberal primarily this has two causes first the fact that the union army won the civil war provides white northerners with a readymade feeling of historical benevolence on the racial front second there is always the south at which northerners can point a castigating finger and swell their chests with pride that race relations in the north are much better than in the south care packages are sent southward to negroes who are being starved and maimed there are freedom rides sympathetic demonstrations fund raising campaigns and nonviolent antisegregation walks these things have inspired white liberals in the north with the illusion that negroes especially those above the masondixon ought to love themor at least appreciate them this is so true that white people all over the north are alarmed and disturbed about the increasing numbers of negroes who are turning their backs on white liberals and casting their lots with such groups as the black muslims the black nationalists and others of similar orientation there is fear in the air no negro can make a speech anywhere now without some white person asking are you a black muslimor what do you think about black muslims for the last several months this is all i have heard from every white person who conceived ot himself as a liberal and like most negroes i have lied or half lied i have given the kind of replies i know white liberals prererred to hear but now i have made up my mind to speak the truth as i see it or to use an ethnic expression i am going to tell it like it isnot only for whites but for negroes as well first of all racial conditions in the north are far from what white liberals have deluded themselves into thinking they are tnere is no need to dwell on the vast amount of public and private jim crow dis crimination and bigotry still being practiced against the northern negro nor can we speak appreciatively of the rate at which race relations are progressingafter all we have had three hundred years now again with the possible i say possible exception of manhattan and one or two other northern communities the negro must consult a map to make certain he is up north in the overwhelming majority of caseshousing education employment civil_rightsbeing a negro in the north has been little better than being a nigger in the south what is more in the north much of the inhumanity toward the negro or unfair treatment is less tangible than in the south it is legally invisible and almost impossible to prove for instance i was recently interviewed for a job by the director of a multimillion dollar social agency in new york city the director found nothing wrong with my qualifications yet as i sat there something seemed to be troubling him finally and quite calmly he informed me that if i were hired i would be the first negro to occupy a semiadministrative position in his agency i would be as he put it the jackie robinson of his agency he wondered if i could command the respect of those white who would be under me he especially emphasized the fact that  would have to represent his agency to other institutions and business firms he was a nice man i sat there quietly smiling at him as i had seen sidney poitier do in a movie i did not get the position someone better qualified got it he happened to be white the purpose of the agency incidentally is to rehabilitate negro and puerto rican teenagers in an area where eightyfive per cent of the population consists of these two groups i have found that not only are there no negroes or puerto ricans in administrative positions in that agency but that the entire board of directors and trustees are all white too often the white northern liberal views the inhumanity toward the american negro as a socialwork problem a problem for individual dogooders and not one which requires the reorganization of the total american social structure when i say reorganization i mean redistribution of economic political and military power in such a fashion that the negro himself will be in a position to make sure that no one public or private can get away with treating him less than a man the fact is the northern white man liberal though he prides himself is not very different from his southern kinsmen the difference lies in the degree of selfdeceit unlike his southern brother the negro in the north no longer believes in the white liberal he no longer trusts him in the south where conditions are so terribly oppressive a white man can be a liberal by merely saying he is for voter registration or school integration on a token level but in the north where the more brutal and obvious forms of inhumanity toward the negro are passing away the wouldbe white liberal finds it increasingly difficult to be a liberal for that means doing something about the final remnants of jim crow doing something about the more subtle psychological and difficulttoprove modes of prejudice all of which the northern white man seems unwilling or unable to eradicate it is because of this that more and more northern negroes are being driven i say driven to abandon the white liberal for it is clear the liberal in the north is no longer a liberal but a hyprocrite at best he is a victim of seemingly an insurmountable selfdeceit to say the least this is what i felt as i listened to the director of that agency who was a jew and i am certain thought of himself as a white liberal a friend of negroes upon innumerable occasions and incidents this is what most negroes feel indeed every american black man at least once in his life has been seized by a passion of intense animosity for the white man if there were any such thing as justifiable hatred the negros hatred for the caucasian race could very well fit this category the rise of the black muslims and other such groups has grown out of the negros impatience with  the white liberal and the not too invalid opinion that white men in general never intend to treator are actually incapable of treating the negro as an equal and the liberals are right as long as they maintain their present position on race their fear of northern negroes is not without grounds for like all modern negroes the black muslims mean business on the other hand white liberals are wrong about many other things for instance the black muslims and here i mean the muslim organization proper is not a movement founded solely on racial hatred and violence there is instead much hatred and malice toward the white man and plain insanity smoldering in the minds of northern negroes and i am coming to this but for now let us try to see the saner side or at least let us be fair something we have found impossible to be in the past when a negro asserts that by and large the white man is an untrustworthy hypocritical devil he is stating more of a fact than a lie he can prove his assertions by statistics history his own objective experiences and by what is going on this very minute not only in the south but all over the united states negroes who say they are superior to white people are not all saying so on the basis of a reverse racism but often because they feel they are more willing to be humane loving and democratic than the white man has proved himself  to be contrary to what many whites think few muslims hate white people as a passion of the ego racism any style is based on lies myths stereotypes fear and guilt the black muslim movement is one expression of an historical necessity for the salvation of the black man in america just as zionism was a movement designed to deliver the jews out of bondage and alienation the white liberal should understand this if under prolonged trial and tribulation the jews could set themselves up as gods chosen nation is it so incomprehensible that god or allah has now after nearly four centuries of oppression selected the negroes as his chosen people what we should further understand is that the whole racial situation in america is itself absurd and insane the negro problem is a product of this situation let loose among the mighty impersonal forces of urban life yet regimented into fetid ghettoes like harlem and south side chicago the northern negro especially is prey to all kinds of doctrines and movements this is why the anger of the negroes has its riotlike momentum in the most advanced northern cities while the southern negro must fight like hell for the bare minimum of freedom the northern negro constitutes what might be called the liberated oppressed had the white man in the north been aware of what these negroes were feeling all along he could have predicted a movement such as the black muslims therefore had they been willing they could have prevented or at least mitigated it but it is too late for that now the american white man has always ignored the negros feelings until it was too late the point now is that the muslim movement is a mass movement in all mass movements there are ingredients that appeal to or produce psychopathic individuals if a movement cult religion or what have you is to be more than a hate group or a gang to perpetrate violence then other ingredients must be incorporated that will counterbalance or neutralize those that induce or appeal to psychopathy to some extent it is the discipline and the religious and intellectual training studying islam and arabic for instance which welds the black muslims into a primary collective energizes the individual muslim with a missionary zeal and gives him a sense of dignity and purpose on the other hand there are many negroes who have latched onto only the raw emotional aspects of the muslim doctrine and now we arrive at the point where it becomes hazardous for me to be honest but i shall try increasing numbers of negroes are being drawn from the ranks of the young avant garde generation who are not actually members of the black muslims but who are nevertheless adopting a psuedomuslim orientation toward the white man they are pseudomuslims because for one thing they have not truly abandoned the white mans values their hatred for whites is really a mixture of selfhatred and envy of the white man their claim to racial superiorty is an inverse expression of their feeling of racial and personal deficiency such negroes are afflicted with what i call the syndrome of blacknessthey are in turmoil with themselves they actually feel inferior because of their color alone and want to become a part of integrated or assimilated into the white world thereby losing their inferiority the attempt to assimilate however is constantly frustrated by the white mans bigotry insincerity and his deep psychological block against negroes the negro is thrown back upon himself his selfesteem is bankrupted racial rage corrodes his psyche the white man mirrors his alter image but the white man denies him the negro therefore hates not only himself but the white man as well he talks and behaves like a schizophrenic preaching black supremacy and hatred of whites on the one hand on the other hand haunting integrated circles bars coffee houses and parties smiling into white faces and incessantly trying to woo the white woman this is the negro you should fear most he is dangerous he wants to eat his color and have it too he has come to an impasse with himself he is the worst kind of racist hating both races he wants to be white and black at once one kind of racism is equally as insane as another i do not wish to exchange one lie one myth for another no matter how functional it may be if the mind of the white southern racist is a sick mind it is inescapable that the mind of the black northern racist is equally dis  eased the psuedomuslim oriented negroes in the north are too often selfstyled hipsters hangerson with little talent or any real qualities by which they can trust themselves to rise in the world they need a bandwagon on which to ride their color becomes that bandwagon at the core of their problem is the psychology of the tough criminal with a chip on his shoulder they do not owe the world anything they think the world owes them everything like the white southern racists they are forever on guard to exploit and intimidate the white man especially the most honest sincere liberal types beware particularly is this true when it comes to the white woman i have witnessed time after time the deliberate unprovoked intimidation of many of my friends by such negroes simply and only because they were white it is a form of racial blackmail practiced on the liberal especially the neophyte liberal there is a strange kind of sadism involved for not only is it masochistic it is selfintimidation also i sat in a bar known for its mixed clientele several negroes were at my table and two white persons the negroes dominated the con versation everything they said for at least an hour smacked at how immoral bigoted and inhumane every white man in america is  r they hated the naacp it was run by white people they hated core also run by whites they hated kennedy and stevenson and mrs roosevelt they found ways of putting white people down they had never heard of or seen meanwhile all africans were great and no white jazz musician was as good as a black jazz musician all the time their eyes were deliberately fixed upon the two whites who very uncomfortably remained at the table i sat quietly and watched them a sickness rose up in me almost everything they said was inaccurate even though one had a college degree and all of them had studied something they were actually illiterate many northern negroes are racial hypochondriacs they are obsessed with racial suffering both real and fantasied they deliberately provoke situations where they can be hurt their aggression is false they are raceniks gaudy hitchhikers trying to steal a ride to a place they do not want to go of course it is not altogether their fault but this is not the question the fact is these negroes are sick people and it is time they faced up to their illness and made a positive attempt at doing something about it on the other hand and this must come hard the fear that northern liberals feel because of the rise of black muslims is valid but only half valid white liberals are guilty themselves their anxiety represents their guilt moreover the other half the valid half of their fear is misplaced consider few negroes can ever become black muslims or black anythings for most of them are hooked so to speak on american values white values their identity can never be anything other than american whatever that may be no amount of energy spent on embezzling an identity such as wearing the hair au natural and calling oneself afroamerican can actually make the negro african definitely american standards of beauty and esthetics will undergo changes under the impact of african influences but changing ones style of dress or switching labels will not erase the facts of the negros life experiences in this country upon which the mystique of his identity hangs it can only hide such facts most negroes look the way they look speak walk and think they way they do because of what has happened to them in america and for no other reason and what does all of this mean for white liberals it means they should not fear the swelling ranks of muslims and muslimlike movements but fear the cause of these movements which is nothing more than the white mans bad faith ignorance and selfdeceit in all matters dealing with race relations in the north because of the white liberals somnolence and recalcitrance in the face of the mood of the negro race relations in the north are going to get worse before they become better what happened in harlem and elsewhere on the various nights of the birmingham rallies is omen for our times the negros anger at the milkwarm nonviolent shadowboxing of northern liberals will flare up boldly with increasing frequency and intensity all over the north it will spread west but by doing everything possible even at the risk of painful selfupheaval to immediately bring about equality and respect for the negro as a human being and a citizen the white liberal can avoid much psychological agony and violence

as white children or as smart or as pretty or as kind i knew that you did not like black children i knew that you did not want black children i did not know why this was so but i knew it was so when i went to school i walked eight blocks past the school for white children which was two blocks from my home in school i used the books that the white children had discarded every morning the teacher read the bible and the class pledged allegiance to the flag i pledged allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible

things the white children did there we went to sing for a recording that was the only place it could be done my teacher told us we must be very neat and clean that day she inspected each one as we arrived at school one girl could not go because her dress was old and torn the teacher told us we must walk slowlv in twos and we must m be very quiet we must not chew gum or laugh or touch anything the white people would not like it if we did any of the things she told us not to do and would not let us come back again we sang four songs on the recording one of the songs was go down moses go down

radicals are not
by james r phillips
s a writer whose work  ja y has been accepted by  £ several of americas outspoken ultraconservative magazines i feel i have as much right as the ksi sii next man to speak for the radical right and i believe the time has long since come when the radical right if it is to gain the respect it deserves as a legitimate movement in modern america must disown all the segregationists segregation as a concept is totally alien to the philosophy which stands at the root and heart of todays ultraconservative movement if any man be a segregationist he cannot be a true radical rightwinger and conversely no  man who is truly a radical rightwinger can be a segregationist this fact is or by rights ought to be selfevident recent events make it clear that the fact is not selfevident and so i propose to right here and now set forth the principles of rightwing radicalism and invite all those who cannot live up to these principles to get themselves out of the modern ultraconservative movement    and to go as far away from us as they can i would like to suggest south africa as a place they might enjoy for the philosophic basis of modern ultraconservatism is the natural law and the natural law as most people know holds that all men are created free and equal no one who believes that can possibly be a believer in white supremacy    for the very idea of natural freedom and natural equality stands as an eternal contradiction to the claims of any race to be supreme yet still we are confronted by statements such as this ill never give up either to integration or communism they are one and the same as far as i am concerned  i dont think any of you want a nigger mayor  or a nigger police chief    but i tell you thats whatll happen if we play dead on this park integration those words were spoken quite recently by art hanes ousted ex mayor of birmingham alabama    the only major city in the united states still segregated exmayor hanes words are an affront to reason because they are so obviously untrue and even immoral many men of good will have chosen not to answer these words they are afraid that if they become involved in a duel of words with this rabid segregationist they will themselves be tainted they are fearful of the old political adage that you cant roll in the mud with a pig without getting dirty because most men of good will do not refute his words he stands unchallenged as a leading spokesman for what most people assume to be ultraconservatism i hereby challenge exmayor hanes right to speak for ultraconservatism in fact i challenge his right to even call himself an ultraconservative he is to be plain and simple in the choice of words a demagogue and nothing could be more alien to the concept of ultraconservatism than racist demagoguery mr hanes said that he doesnt think anyone wants to see a negro police chief well as an ultraconservative i voted for a negro for the position of attorney general of massachusetts last fall this man edward w brooke a brilliant lawyer was elected as chief law enforcement officer of the commonwealth of massachusetts he has done a darned good job so far he is moving to restore the atmosphere of integrity that was once the hallmark of massachusetts politics so many people are pleased with the job this man is doing that there is now talk in republican circles in this state of offering him the nomination for u s senate if he chooses to run and his opponent would be none other than teddy kennedy himself he would have at least a fair chance of victory he was the only republican to survive a democratic landslide in massachusetts last fall the prospect of my state sending a negro to represent us in the u s senate doesnt bother me at all personally id consider it to be a big improvement over the obnoxious little brother of the president now representing us in the senate if it would bother the ousted exmayor of birmingham alabama then one of us must be a traitor to the radical rightwing movement i feel the fact that my articles have been accepted by several national publications proves that my views are in accord with national ultraconservative thinking that means he must be the one who does not belong in the rightwing movement so i hereby invite him to get out of this movement    and to take with him everyone who thinks like he does i dont think it will be any great loss to the ultraconservative movement and i know it certainly wont be any great loss to the nation  the radical rightwing movement of today rests foursquare on the principles that motivated abraham lincoln and if any man seriously believes that lincoln would agree with mayor hanes then that man has not read history carefully abraham lincoln was a contemporary of karl marx and the record shows that lincoln forcefully and convincingly refuted the ideas of marx more than  years ago yet lincoln did not feel that because he was an anticommunist he also had to oppose freedom and dignity for negroes many southerners to this day like to claim that the civil war was fought by the north to preserve the union to some extent this is true but it is only a halftruth it was no accident that the civil warwhich hung as a threat over america for a generation    broke loose in all its bloody terror at precisely the time that lincoln was elected president lincoln had often expressed in public his personal wish that all men everywhere should be free in  he won a plurality in a fourway race for the presidency southern states began seceding at once from the union by the time lincoln took the oath of office civil war had become inevitable to many in the north it was a holy crusade to free the negroes note the words in the battle hymn of the republic wherein does that battle song proclaim the preservation of the union as the number one goal of the north it did not rather it spoke of a wish to make men free the last time i checked a history book it said that the north had won the civil war since the north did win that war the principles which motivated that war should be by rights part of the american tradition the principle of freedom was the paramount cause of the war and it should be by now the basis of american tradition apparently men like mr hanes still do not believe that the south lost that war they are trying to preserve a prebellum southern philosophy as individuals they have a right to do sobut not in the movement which seeks to stand fast on the principles of abraham lincoln thus as an ultraconservative myself i must charge again that hanes cannot speak for us nor indeed can anyone who thinks like mr hanes speak for us not only are they out of step with the thinking that lies behind the rightwing movement of today but they also are out of step with the best of their own southern traditions lincoln himself stated that he had drawn his political principles directly from the thinking of a southernerthomas jefferson can mr hanes or any other man say that jefferson author of the declaration of independence and founder of the party he called republican which now calls itself democratic would agree in the slightest with the philosophy of to days white citizen councils how could anyone make such a statement and how could anyone claim that gen robert e lee another great southerner would have any sympathy with modern white supremacist views gen lee despised slavery and sought justice among men his heart was torn in two when he had to make the decision to return to virginia and lead the southern armies his conscience led him to defend the states rights views of jefferson who let it be remembered was so hostile to the strong central government under gen washington that he created a second party to stand for states rights he called that party republican simply because he wanted to remind people that we were a republic now many rightwingers have been criticized today for a slogan that says this is a republic not a democracy the criticism is i believe caused more by the hypocrisy of some southern white supremacists than it is by the slogan itself the slogan is historically valid it comes from a statement made by benjamin franklin as he was leaving the constitutional convention of  a woman asked him if we had an aristocracy or a democracy he replied neither madame  you have a republic if you can keep it now i do feel that it was a mistake for the rightwing movement of today to omit the word aristocracy we dont have one from its slogan this tends to make some people think that the rightwing movement is an aristocratic movement i can say from personal experience that this is decisively not so it is basically a middleclass movement why do i think it is important to stressas jefferson did when he began his new party in that this is a republic let me answer this with an example ancient greece was a democracy and in this democracy the majority could vote to grant or deny rights to individuals the individual had no rights in greece except those granted to him bv the majority through their political formthe state because of this greece had slavery a foul and odious evil when brave men such as socrates questioned such evil facets of the greek society they were liquidated socrates was orderedby a majorityto drink from the cup of poison hemlock here in my home state of massachusetts we had a democracy in the very early days the pilgrims and their fellowpuritans did not adopt the plantation system of rich planters so popular in southern colonies here from the day of the mayflower compact every basic decision was made by a majority voteand gradually the franchise was extended to include all men this democracy produced some unfortunate excesses for example  the quakers were denied religious freedom  and some were hanged on boston common as in greece the individual here had no absolute rights of course the democratic and collective spirit of the puritans in their early davs did produce some noted advantages boston for examole had set uo a free public school  years before karl marx offered the idea to europe as a bold new innovation in his communist manifesto as a deep believer in our pilgrim tradition i naturallv take offense at those pennvpinching southerners who oppose spending on public schools especially for negroes on the grounds that such schools are communistic they are no such things they are as american as the mayflowerfor the pilgrims actually came to america to set up schools for their children who were learning the dutch language and foreign customs during their exile in holland from  to  boston and the massachusetts bay colony also had some of the worlds most advanced social welfare legislation we were as we are to this day a commonwealth    and this word derives from the words common and wealth the idea of sharing took deep root here very early as a result we had few rich and almost no real poor we were basically a middleclass society with free public schools the best possible ground in which to plant the seed called democracy yet even here it fell short of its potential gradually the puritans began to go beyond the collective democratic traditions of our commonwealth we began to evolve the theory of individualism this theory was later to be promoted vigorously by such bay staters as ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau but earlier than that it was imbedded in our state constitution by such patriotscholars as john adams the supreme court of massachusetts declared slavery illegal in this state in  four years before the american constitution was written because our constitution contained the phrase all men are born equal the court ruled that the constitution did not say just white men    but rather all men the philosophy of a southerner thomas jefferson had won its first great battleright here in massachusetts unfortunately it did not win the battle for mens minds in the south it has not apparently won the battle to this day if i understand correctly the political philosophy of gov ross barnett of mississippi he feels that a majority in any one state has the right to deny individual rights to citizens of that state now that is not a new philosophy it was advanced by stephen douglas during his  debates with abraham lincoln of course lincoln rejected such a notion out of hand he would as a jeffersonian he stated boldly that all men are by right free no democratic majority has a right to deny one man or  men or  men that freedom that is because fortunately we are a republic that is to say we have a bill of rights this bill of rights sets forth certain rights that individuals have rights that the federal government cannot take away from individuals even if  per cent  per cent  per cent or  per cent of the ople vote in a moment of temporary madness to take away such rights of course the people have a right to change the constitution through amendments but jefferson had stated himself in the declaration of independence that governments should not be radically changed except for good reason and the founding fathers made the process of amendment a long one to give people time to cool off before they rushed through amendments they might reject later the th amendment extended the protection of the bill of rights so that individuals were protected against state laws which tried to take away their individual rights thus the constitution prevents a majority of citizens in any one state such as mississippifrom inflicting a tyranny of the majority upon helpless individuals in a minority in that state here you have the essence of the rightwing slogan that this is a republic not a democracy put this way it really doesnt sound so  bad in fact i think it sounds quite good thats why i get perturbed by southern racists who claim to be rightwing ultraconservatives and who nevertheless demand the right to have a democratic majority nullify the rights of individuals they are frauds hypocrites and liars that doesnt bother me what bothers me is that everyone who hears them thinks that all of us rightwing ultraconservatives are frauds hypocrites and liars for example i recently sold an article entitled negroes are winning equality in boston the boston story june  to negro digest the editor of that publication a sensitive journalist seemed surprised that a rightwing radical like me could be so enthusiastically in favor of negro rights i wrote him a letter tying to explain that the difference between southern racists and myself is that when i say i believe in the bill of rights i mean it and they dont i hope he believed me but i rather doubt that he did he has no doubt been burned too many times by hypocrites to trust anyone any longer and thats what really bothers me about white supremacists russia has turned down a road that seems to lead towards racism they have been segregating and persecuting negro students from africa and they have begun shooting people predominantly jews reopening memories of zsarist pogroms from oldendays for economic crimes i believe that minority groups would turn again to the american system of free enterprise and constitutional safeguards of individual freedoms as their best and only hopeif the white supremacists were not discrediting those solid old american ideals let me give you two contrasting examples of the good and the bad in the rightwing movement to make my point anger at hypocrites clearer first lets take arizona this state most people agree is the hotbed of rightwing thinking in america today if rightwingers were really all racists this state would be more racist than alabama or mississippi yet look at what really happened the rightwingers in arizona repealed an old state law that prevented mixed marriages miscegenation the rightwingers believers in individual freedom held that it was solely  a matter for the indivdual to decide and not one the state had a right to intrude upon can any negro take offense at the states action in leaving up to individuals whether they wished to marry in their own race or out of it i dont see how a negro could be anything but pleased by such an action i think it speaks clearly of the philosophy behind the current rightwing movement but then look at california by contrast i understand that rightwingers are quite strong out there too i also understand that two of their favorite bogey men today are milton eisenhower and supreme court chief justice earl warren i wont go into the reasons for such hostility on the part of rightwingers except to say that it is no secret warren has been a target for racist criticism ever since his opinion in the school desegregation case again what bothers me here is the hypocrisy early in world war ii earl warren was attorneygeneral of california he got the federal government to set up concentration camps for japaneseamericans from californiaincluding americanborn american citizens milton eisenhower was commandant of that nowinfamous concentration camp i wish i thought that today s critics of warren and milton eisenhower were all warreneisenhower critics  years agobut i have my suspicions that many of todays critics were then among warrens and milton eisenhower s greatest fans the antijapanese hysteria in california then was obviously raciallymotivated after all hawaii did no intern its japaneseamericans wisconsin did not intern the germanamericans who had been attracted to midwest bund meetings during the s here in massachusetts where the yankees had shown what they thought of the flood of italian immigrants during the saccovanzetti trial in the mids no one proposed a concentration camp for italianamericans ven though many such people had not taken out citizenship papers and were still sending money home to italy when war actually broke out i personally have my doubts about earl warren and milton eisenhowerand my doubts grow out of their leadership in that concentration camp matter they proved then that they are alltoohuman and thus fallible they have made serious mistakes in judgments in the past and i now feel i have a right to maintain reasonable doubts about their wisdom and their infallibility but my doubts rest on their action against a racial minority not out of more recent acts in favor of such minorities thus i feel i am consistent in my rightwing views but that the racists are not i want to preserve all that is best in our tradition they seem determined to perpetuate all that is worst i have no hope of convincing honest and reasonable men of my sincerity and of the value of my idealsso long as white supremacists cloud peoples minds with their hypocritical babblings thus i hereby attack these phoniesand invite them to get out of the rightwing movement i want to see it made pure and decent 
what christianity did for africa 
by laurian cardinal rugambwa
hristianit y most that precious is the thing africa has received from the west at an early date in christian history africa saw the church take roots in its soil st mark disciple of st peter founded the church at alexandria and flourishing christian communities soon existed all along the southern shore of the mediterranean the names of st augustine bishop of hippo st cyril bishop of alexandria st cyprian the martyrbishop of carthage head the lists of the christian saints and martyrs of north africa however this christian influence never penetrated south of the sahara and by the seventh century islam had replaced christianity in north africa the history of the church is made up of swings of the pendulum bright hopes followed by unexpected declines a step forward somewhere with a step backward elsewhere several heroic but rather unsuccessful attempts to christianize tropical africa were made during the th th and th centuries at one time great hopes sprang up in the th century at the conversion of the king of the congo whose son became a bishop of this christian kingdom nothing remained a century later however at the end of the th century and the beginning of the th century the christian faith began to be permanently implanted along the coastline of africa the slave trade had kept the center of the continent closed to christian influence it was only after the middle of the th century that christian missionaries began to move inland missionary work on a large scale in central africa did not get under way until the th century the progress of christianity in africa has been fantastic lacking reliable statistics for total christian  population i shall use my own church as an example in  there were only  catholics in africa and by  the number had only increased to  and by  only to  then began the amazing period of growth  in    in  and today the  mark has been passed although future increases are not expected to be so spectacular one can never tell when dealing with a continent as vast as africa christianity has brought many benefits to the africans the greatest of these has been a strong faith in god africa has always accepted the existence of a one true god creator of heaven and earth but this belief was clouded by superstitious preoccupation with a world of lesser spirits christianity has liberated africa from the centuryold servitude of superstitious fear and practice in the sphere of human relations the christian faith has communicated to africa a knowledge of and respect for the basic human rights of the individual christianity has also given to africa a concern for the whole man not merely his spiritual and moral welfare but his physical economic and social welfare as well this has come by doctrine preaching and by the inspiring example of generations of selfsacrificing missionaries time was when the word missionary conjured up a vision of a father with a long beard sun helmet and high boots or a sister robed in white habit and veil but nowadays a missionary may just as easily resemble the ordinary young man and woman you pass any day on the streets of america or europe lay people are now coming out to africa in increasing numbers convinced that they have a special part to play here in the establishment of christianity they do not regard themselves as a stopgap because the number of priests and religious is too few for the work to be accomplished nor do they merely have the idea of placing their professional knowledge and skill at the service of the church they see their task as the christianization of the new milieu in which they find themselves their main objective is to give a practical demonstration of what it means to be a christian at home at work at leisure and in all the ordinary circumstances of life concern for the sick and diseased for orphans and the aged has always been a part of the christian tradition you are all familiar with the fine work of dr albert schweitzer cf lambarene in gabon but you must realize that there are thousands more devoted medical missionaries who have labored unheralded for years in littleknown corners of the african continent but it is in the field of education that the missions have brought perhaps the greatest contribution to the elevation of the african peoples in the not toodistant past the only schools in tropical africa were those built and run by missionaries colonial governments have recognized encouraged and supported this missionary endeavor in the field of education todays african leadersin every field government the professions and the churchowe much to the men and women who devoted themselves to the long painstaking process of leading an entire people along the arduous path of education i myself can testify to what has been accomplished in this field in tanganyika the catholic church has over  young men and women under instruction this is just about half of the entire school population of the country the overall influence of christianity in africa is far greater than bare statistics might indicate although africa is only  per cent christian the spirit of christianity has exerted a large influence on the development of the continent the fact that the majority of the educated class have received a good christian education has been one of the principal causes for this influence the church is beginning to take root in native structures it is not yet a hundred years since the first africans of modern timesthe martyrs of ugandashed their blood for christ today the christian seeds have sprung up and keep springing up from this soil made fertile by their blood and by the many sacrifices of the missionary generosity of the christian west the catholic church has chosen over  africans for its hierarchy from among the  african priests now in her service however the establishment of christianity does not mean only the conversion of individuals but rather the christianizing of a culture and this takes time bringing the christian mentality to african society is a process that grows slowly africans in general and african leaders in particular must realize this basic truth there is nothing in authentic christianity which is incompatible with the true values of our tradition and culture the gospel message will never require the elimination and destruction of what is good in our life and there is much that is good in the tribal structure and tradition christianity elevates and purifies where necessary but it does not destroy basic human values from an address before the national press club during cardinal rugambwas first visit to the united states

henr christophe
by walter monfried
urmoil and trouble t £ have often prevailed in  haiti as at present vs but never has the little island realm had such exciting and saguinary drama as in the reign of its good king henri a century and a half ago henri christophe was a fullblooded negro of giant stature and strength uneducated and totally illiterate all his life he became a good general and an economic administrator of genius in his  years as chief of the haitian state he gave it a wealth and prosperity unequaled before or since little is known of his early years he was born of slave parents in  probably on kitts island in the caribbean the boy by turns was a mason sailor stable hand bartender waiter and billiard marker in an inn at cap haitien in his early twenties he had saved enough to buy his freedom haiti was then a french colony st domingue populated by   whites and  negroes the french revolution which broke out in  created shattering emotions in haiti fear among the whites exultant hope among the slaves colored men who demanded the liberty equality fraternity promised by the revolution were publicly tortured and slain pierre toussaint toussaint loverture a yearold coachman and jean jacques dessalines a negros slave realized that haiti was ripe for revolt and determined to lead it they organized secret meetings of insurgents and collected arms in august of  rioting mobs burned hundreds of plantations and sugar refineries and slaughtered thousands of white people the napoleonic wars which allied spain and england against france confused the haitian situation further toussaint joined the spanish forces on hispaniola the island made of haiti and the present dominican republic by  he was chief of haiti and christophe was second only to him as an army general governor of cap francois province and a wealthy owner of a mansion how he attained such heights in a few years has not been revealed toussaint showed such unmistakable talents in repelling french spanish and british forces that he was called louverture the opener in france napoleon refused to acknowledge haitian independence and he sent an expedition of  warships and  soldiers to subdue the island he placed his brotherinlaw capt gen charles le clerc  in command le clerc upon reaching haiti demanded submission which was refused the french force landed and found the earth scorched christophe himself put the torch to his own home and the rest of the city of cap francois then he and his followers took to the hills the french won battle after battle but their morale and health declined in the face of the elusive foe when le clerc announced that slavery would be restored thousands of haitians joined christophe realizing his error le clerc retracted declared slavery abolished and offered haiti independence under french supervision toussaint and christophe accepted the compromise christophe and dessalines were commissioned french generals in charge of haiti and toussaint retired to his plantation but sincerity was no part of the french scheme toussaint was kidnaped and sent to a paris dungeon where he died a year later from cold and neglect realizing that he had been hoodwinked christophe quietly resumed plans for rebellion yellow fever he noticed would defeat the french more decisively than his army could le clerc himself was one of the many frenchmen who died in the months of occupation and his remaining force withered and was driven to the sea in  haitian independence was affirmed again dessalines ugly in appearance and temper headed the state he antagonized his subjects with his many mistresses his minuets and the harshness of his dictatorship after he was killed by a mob the leaders of haiti adopted a republican constitution and appointed christophe president chief governor and commander in chief of land and sea forces the haitian economy was in distress there was not even a national monetary system so christophe asked for and received more than  gourdes on which he placed a value of a franc  each with these he purchased the coffee crop sold it to foreign nations for gold and thus established a stable currency haitis basic coin is still called the gourde and is still valued at  dessalines death was followed by a civil war alexandre petion part french and part negro a onetime general of toussaint led the rebellion which resulted in southern haitis becoming a separate state or republic christophe remained supreme in the north and assumed the title of king in  emulating frederick the great of prussia he called his royal palace san souci without care for a man who couldnt read he had picked up a lot of general information with patience two of his educated officials taught him to write henri i that is all he ever could write an atheist himself henri established catholicism as the state religion and was crowned by a french priest who became the court chaplain he likewise set up a system of nobilityprinces dukes counts barons and knights among these noblemen were the count de lemonade and the duke de marmalade an elaborate court etiquette was decreed and if any of the peers came to court in slovenly attire or displayed uncouth manners he was likely to join the convict gang that for years labored upon christophes formidable citadel the monarch enforced a drastic labor code too all ablebodied men had to work from sunrise to sunset with an hour off for breakfast and two hours off at midday there were frequent mutters of slavery among the toilers but the land was cultivated effectively and haiti became wealthy not only in agriculture but in shipping and cotton manufacture from time to time the king of france or napoleonwhich ever was in powersought an alliance with haiti but henri replied in an insolent negative unlettered as he was henri realized the value of education established schools and imported teachers he also built a royal hospital and a rudimentary school of medicine directed by a scot dr duncan stewart who remained faithful to the end henri well realized that his monarchy would last only as long as his own strength and vigor although he had his son declared heir to the throne he shipped   in gold coins to the bank of england where it was deposited in his wifes name in his last years he became increasingly harsh and eccentric he beat an officer whose uniform was wrinkled he noticed a farmer snoozing in the field and fired a cannon at him he who had been a billiard marker became a billiard addict his sole other recreation was an outgrowth of his boyhood masonry far into the night he toiled alone upon the citadels walls one day in  he astounded his servants by saying that he was going to a nearby village to attend mass he entered the empty church knelt and collapsed dr stewart diagnosed it as a stroke which would prevent his ever walking again nonsense king henri replied im reviewing the army tomorrow the next day with the army at attention henri was carried to his steed he took a few steps and trying to mount collapsed to the muddy earth the army marched away shouting long live the king and when it was out of earshot shouted down with the king he knew the game was over he was taken back to his palace and fired a silver bullet into his head the rebels killed the crown prince but permitted henris widow and daughters to go to europe and enjoy their fortune haiti itself soon relapsed into its prechristophe languor and poverty the silver bullet has been a fascinating legend in the west indies ever since eugene oneill the american playwright learned of it in his travels and used it in one of his early plays the emperor jones in the play jones a onetime pullman porter becomes emperor of a tiny caribbean island and boasts that only a silver bullet can bring him down so the rebellious natives mold a silver bullet to end the emperors career

the sounds one v hears from the direc tion of hollywood and the mai or tv net  works can be believed negro actors are on the threshold of a breakthrough into realistic roles that is negroes will be presented in parts more in keeping with reality which is to say of course that they will be portrayed like other people this could lead to the establishment of negro actors as international matinee idols and the present success of at least three of these actors augurs well for this prospect harry belafonte for instance is already a romantic figure despite hollywoods nervous approach to his roles in films only in movies with allnegro casts have the movie moguls dared to exploit belafontes ample and obvious sex appeal the big expensive island in the sunwhich pussyfooted around the romance between belafonte and joan fontaine was a grand example of hollywoods timidity no virile handsome west indian male is likely to talk his way through a courtship with a beautiful woman whatever her color and the inference that one might was libel on that robust race of men the possibilities of belafonte as a lover are limitless and if the box office balks in dixie well there is all of europe and africa and asia to make up for it in recent years however belafonte has withdrawn from the movie scene leaving it pretty much to sidney poitier like belafonte poitier most often has appeared in romantic parts only in allnegro films or in strictly restricted situations in other films even in the highlyregarded lilies of the field his role is heroic without being romantic poitier however recently broke out of that bag by hiring himself out to moviemakers in europe in the long ships which was filmed in yugoslavia poitier portrays a dashing moorish sheik whose paramour is a lovely viking lady the history of the mediterranean world is rich in stories of the adventures of africans and europeans are not afraid to tell the stories following the precedent of belafonte who took a fling at producing his own movies odds against tomorrow sidney poitier has indicated that he has written a play which he may present on broadway in the near future the key role of course was tailored to his own individual talent europe which claimed actor gordon heath more than a decade ago and to which poitier temporarily escapes has been good to actor william marshall as well the indianaborn exile who found reasonably steady work in hollywood portraying various and sundry slaves has achieved enormous success on the continent particularly in shakespeares plays last summer he journeyed to spain and then on to africa to recreate the role of a missionary in the spanish film piedra de toque marshall had to share his shakespearean chores and laurels this year with another expatriate american actor earle hyman unlike marshall however hyman first found a niche among the shake earle henry hyman scott spearean actors at home during one season at stratfordonthehousatonic he had no less a leading lady than the great katherine hepburn hyman departed these shores early in  for a tour of the european continent that began in norway echoes reverberating back across the atlantic indicated that his othello would have made the bard of avon proud hyman first gained recognition on broadway for the role which catapulted still another handsome young thespian into the hollywood spotlight that of the innocent young hero in anna lucasta henry scott graduated from such theater roles as brett in deep are the roots to the lead in the film version of anna lucasta and then finding no new roles dropped out of sight brock peters has been luckier during  he appeared in two topbracket films to kill a mocking bird and the lshaped room and he also enjoyed a brief theatrical fling in the role of othello a singer of note as well as an excellent actor peters needs not worry too much about the dearth of feature roles for young negro actors concert and night club bookings are always available to him still it is as an actor that he would prefer to earn his spurs and as a romantic leading man he hasas his handling of the role of crown in porgy and bess proved all the qualifications as ripe material for romantic leading roles ossie davis emerged at just that moment when his star as playwright also was ascending davis like his gifted wife ruby dee had been around broadway for close to  years making the best of whatever parts came his way not until he stepped into the a raisin in the sun role made famous by sidney poitier however did the public realize his romantic potential a few months later he was riding the crest of broadway stardom in purlie victorious his own satiric vehicle and even in purlies ramshackle environment and rustic language the actors glamor shone through perhaps now if the optimists are right the young actors now making a name for themselves in television and the theater will stand a genuine chance of making the grade as romantic leads there is a fine brace of candidateslonnie sattin ivan dixon and billy dee williams among them all three of these young men have scored heavily in the theatre sattin in body beautiful and the abortive kicks and company dixon in a raisin in the sun and williams in a taste of honey it remains to see whether theyand others like them will be able to slip through the breakthrough in the wall of racial prejudice 
coffee for the road

hey were past the  maizelands and driving through the wide low semidesert country that sprawled away on all sides in reddishbrown flats hey  and depressions the land going south was scattered with scrub and thorn bushes like a vast unswept carpet far to the right the metal vanes of a windmill turned wearily in the faint morning breeze as if it had been wakened to set reluctantly about its duty of sucking water from the miserly earth the car hurtled along the asphalt road its tyres roaring along the black surface i please want another sandwich  zaida said she sat hud  died in a blanketed space among some suitcases in the back she was six years old and weaa y from the long speeding journey and her initial interest in the landscape had evaporated so that now she sagged tiredly in the padded space ignoring the parched gullies and stunted trees that whisked past theres some in the tin you can help yourself cant you the woman at the wheel said without taking her eyes off the road do you want to eat some more too ray not hungry any more the boy beside her replied he was gazing out at the barbedwire fence that streamed back outside the turnedup window how fars it to cape town mummy zaida asked munching a sandwich well be there tomorrow afternoon the woman said will papa be waiting of course theres some sheep the boy ray said a scattering of farm buildings went by drab dusty dominoshaped structures along a brown slope the mother had been driving all night and she was feeling fatigued her red eyes with the feeling of sand under the lids irritating the eyeballs they had stopped for a short while along the road the night before parked in a gap off the road outside a small town there had been nowhere to put up for the night the hotels were for  whites only in fact only whites lived in these towns and everybody else except for the servants lived in the tumbledown mud houses in the locations beyond besides they did not know anybody in this part of the country dawn had brought depression gloom illtemper which she tried to control in the presence of the children after having parked on that stretch of road until after midnight she had started out again and driven the children asleep through the rest of the night now she had a bad headache too and when zaida said can i have a meatball mummy she snapped irritably oh dash it all its there eat it cant you the landscape ripped by like a film being run backwards redbrown yellowred pinkred all studded with sparse bushes and broken boulders to the east a huge outcrop of rock strata rose abruptly from the arid earth like a titanic wedge of purpleandlavender layered cake topped with chocolatecoloured boulders the car passed over a stretch of gravel road and the red dust boiled behind it like a flameshot smokescreen a bird its long ribbonlike tail streaming behind it skimmed the brush beyond the edge of the road flitting along as fast as the car look at that funny bird mummy the boy ray cried and pressed his face to the dustfilmed glass the mother ignored him trying to relax behind the wheel her feet moving unconsciously but skillfully on the pedals in the floor she thought that it would have been better to have taken a train but billy had written that hed need the car because he had a lot of contacts to visit she hoped the business would be better in the cape her head ached and she drove automatically she was determined to finish the journey as quickly as possible ray said i want some coffee and he reached for the thermos flask on the rack under the dashboard ray could take care of himself he did not need to have little things done for him give me some too zaida called from the back among the suitcases and grips dont be so greedy ray said to her eating eating eating im not greedy i want a drink of coffee you had coffee this morning i want some more greedy greedy children the mother said wearily children stop that arguing he started first zaida said stop it stop it her mother told her ray was unscrewing the cap of the thermos when it was off he drew the cork and looked in man there isnt any he said there isnt any more coffee well thats just too bad the mother said i want a drink zaida cried im thirsty i want some coffee the mother said wearily oh all right but youve got to wait well get some somewhere up the road but wait will you the sun was a coppery smear in the flat blue sky and the countryside scorched yellow and brown like an immense slice of toast quivered and danced in the haze the woman drove on tiredly her whole mind rattling like a stale nut behind the sunglasses her eyes were redrimmed and there was a stretched look about the dark handsome indian face her whole system felt taut and stretched like the wires of a harp but too tight so that a touch might snap any one of them the miles purred and growled and hummed past flat country and dustcoloured buttes the bakedclay gulches and low ridges of hills a shepherds hut lonely as a lost soul crouched against the shalecovered side of a flat hill now and then a car passed theirs headed in the opposite direction going north crashing by in a shrill wine of slipstream the glare of the sun quivered and quaked as if the air was boiling i want some coffee zaida repeated petulantly we didnt have no coffee well buy some coffee the mother told her well buy some for the road as soon as we get to a cafe stop it now eat another sandwich dont want sandwich want coffee a group of crumbling huts like scattered broken cubes passed them in a hollow near the road and a band of naked dusty brown children broke from the cover of a sheeppen dashing to the side of the road cheering and waving at the car ray waved back laughing and then they were out of sight the windscoured metal pylon of a waterpump drew up and then disappeared too three black men trudged in single file along the roadside looking ahead into some unknown future wrapped in tattered dusty blankets oblivious of the heat their heads shaded by the ruins of felt hats they did not waver as the car spun past them but walked with fixed purpose the car slowed for a steelslung bridge and they rumbled over the dry rockstrewn bed of a stream a few sheep their fleeces black with dust sniffed among the boulders watched over by a man like a scarecrow at a distance they passed the coloured location and then the african location hovels of clay and clapboard strewn like discoloured dice along a brown slope with tiny people and antlike dogs moving among them on another slope the name of the town was spelled out in whitewashed boulders the car passed the sheds of a  railway siding with sheep milling in corrals then lurched over the crossing and bounced back onto the roadway a coloured man went by on a bicycle and they drove slowly past the nondescript brown front of the railway hotel a line of stores and beyond a burnt hedge a group of white men with red sunskinned windhoned faces sat drinking at tables in front of another hotel with an imitation dutchcolonial fagade there was other traffic parked along the dusty gravel street of the little town powdered cars and battered pickup trucks a wagon in front of a feed store an old coloured man swept the pavement in front of a shop his reed broom making a hissing sound like gas escaping in spurts two white youths pinkfaced and yellowhaired dressed in khaki shorts and shirts stared at the car their eyes suddenly hostile at the sight of a dark woman driving its shiny newness metal fittings factorysmooth under a film of road dust the car spun a little cloud behind it as it crept along the redgravel street whats the name of this place mummy the boy ray asked  i dont know the mother replied tired but glad to be able to slow down just some place in the karroo whats that man doing zaida asked peering out through her window where ray asked looking about what man hes gone now the little girl said you didnt look quickly then will we get coffee now i think so the mother said you two behave yourselves and therell be coffee dont you want a cool drink no the boy said you just get thirsty again afterwards i want a lot of coffee with lots of sugar zaida said all right the mother said now stop talking such a lot up ahead at the end of a vacant lot stood a cafe tubular steel chairs and tables stood on the pavement outside in front of its shaded windows its front was decorated with old coca cola signs and painted menus a striped awning shaded the tables in the wall facing the vacant space was a footsquare hole where nonwhites were served and a group of ragged coloured and african people stood in the dust and tried to peer into it their heads together waiting with forced patience the mother drove the car up and brought it to a stop in front of the cafe inside a radio was playing and the slats of the venetian blinds in the windows were clean and dustless give me the flask the mother said and took the thermos bottle from the boy she unlatched the door now you children just sit quiet i wont be long she opened the door and slid out and standing for a moment on the pavement felt the exquisite relief of loosened muscles she stretched herself enjoying the almost sensual pleasure of her straightened body but her head still ached badly and that spoiled the momentary delight which she felt with the feeling gone her brain was tired again and the body once more a tightwound spring she straightened the creases out of the smart tan suit she was wearing but left the jacket unbuttoned ¦ then carrying the thermos flask she crossed the pavement walking between the plastic and steel furniture into the cafe inside the cafe was cool and lined with glass cases displaying cans and packages like specimens in some futuristic museum from somewhere at the back of the place came the sound and smell of potatoes being fried an electric fan buzzed on a shelf and two gleaming urns one of tea and the other for coffee steamed against the back wall the only other customer was a small white boy with towcoloured hair a face like a nearripe apple and a running nose he wore a washedout print shirt and khaki shorts and his dusty bare feet were yellowwhite and horny with cracked callous his pink sticky mouth explored the surface of a lollipop while he scanned the covers of a row of outdated magazines in a wire rack behind the glass counter and a trio of soda fountains a broad heavy woman in a green smock thumbed through a little stack of accounts ignoring the group of dark faces pressing around the square hole in the side wall she had a roundshouldered thick body and reddishcomplexioned face that looked as if it had been sandblasted into its component parts hard plains of cheeks with knobbly cheekbones and a bony ridge of nose that separated twin lakes of dull grc and the mouth a bitter gash cold and malevolent as a lizards a dry chapped and serrated pink crack she looked up and started to say something and then saw the colour of the other woman and for a moment the grey lakes of the eyes threatened to spill over as they gaped the thin pink mouth writhed like a worm in a puddle of milk as she sought for words can you fill this flask with coffee for me please the mother asked the crack opened and a screech came from it harsh as the sound of metal rubbed against stone coffee my lord jesus christ the voice screeched a bedamned coolie girl in here the eyes stared in horror at the brown tired handsome indian face with its smart sunglasses and the city cut of the tan suit coolies kaffirs and hottentots outside dont you bloodywell know and you talk english too hey the mother stared at her startled and then somewhere inside her something went off  snapped like a tightwound spring suddenly loose jangling shrilly into action and she cried out with disgust as her arm came up and the thermos flask hurtled at the white woman bloody white trash she cried coolie yourself the flask spun through the air and before the woman behind the counter could ward it off it struck her forehead above an eyebrow bounced away tinkling as the thin glass inside the metal cover shattered and upset a stand of stale chewinggum the woman behind the counter screeched again and clapped a hand to the bleeding gash over her eye staggering back the little boy dropped his lollipop with a yelp and dashed out the dark faces at the hatch gaped the dark woman turned and stalked from the cafe in a rage she crossed the sidewalk her brown face taut with anger and opened the door of the car furiously the group of nonwhites from the hole in the wall around the side of the building came to the edge of the vacant lot and stared at her as she slammed the door of the car and started the motor she drove savagely away from the place her hands gripping the wheel tightly so that the knuckles showed yellow through the brown skin then she recovered herself and relaxed wearily slowing down feeling tired again through the anger she took her time out of town while the children gazed  sensing that something was wrong then the boy ray asked isnt there any coffee mummy and wheres the flask no there isnt any cofile the mother replied well have to do without coffee im afraid i wanted coffee the little girl zaida complained you be good the mother said mummys tired and please stop chattering did you lose the flask ray asked keep quiet keep quiet the woman told him and they lapsed into silence they drove past the edge of the town past a dusty servicestation with its red pumps standing like sentinels before it two africans in overalls played draughts behind them past a man carrying a huge bundle of firewood on his head and past the last buildings of the little town a huddle of whitewashed cabins with chickenc scrabbling in the dooryard a sagging shearingshed with a pile of dirty tables of wool inside and a man hanging over a fence watching them go by the road speared once more into the redyellowbrown countryside and the last green trees dwindled away the sunlight danced and jiggled like a midday ghost across the expressionless earth and the tyres of the car rumbled faintly on the black asphalt there was some traffic ahead of them but the  woman did not bother to try to overtake the boy broke the silence in the car by saying will papa take us for drives he will i know zaida said i like this car better than uncle ikes well he gave us lots of rides ray replied there goes one of those funny birds again mummy will we get some coffee later on zaida asked maybe dear well see the mother said the dry and dusty landscape continued to escape past the window on either side of the car up ahead the sparse traffic on the road was slowing down and the mother eased her foot on the accelerator look at that hill the boy ray cried it looks like a face is it a real face zaida asked peering out dont be silly ray answered how can it be a real face it just looks like one the car slowed down and the mother thrusting her head through her window peered forward past the car in front and saw the roadblock beyond it a small riotvan a landrover its windows and spotlight screened with thick wiremesh had been pulled up halfway across the road and a dusty automobile parked opposite it forming a barrier with just a carwide space between them a policeman in khaki shirt and trousers and flat cap leaned against the front fender of the automobile and held a stengun across his thighs another man in khaki sat at the wheel of the car and a third policeman stood by the gap directing the traffic through after examining the drivers the car ahead slowed down as it came up to the gap the driver signalling with his hand through his window he pulled up and the policeman looked at him stepped back and waved him on the car went through revved and rolled away the policeman turned towards the next car holding up a hand and the mother driving it felt the sudden pounding of her heart she braked and waited watching the khakiclad figure strolling the short distance towards her he had a young face with the usual redburned complexion of the land under the shiny leather bill of the cap he was smiling thinly but the smile did not reach his eyes which bore the hard qaulity of chips of granite he wore a holstered pistol at his waist and coming up he turned towards the others and called this looks like the one the man with the stengun straightened but did not come forward his companion inside the car looked across at the woman the policeman in the road said still smiling slightly ah we have been waiting for you you didnt think theyd phone ahead hey the children in the car sat dead  still staring their eyes troubled the mother said looking out whats it all about never mind whats its all about the policeman said to her you know whats it all about he looked her over and nodded ja darkie girl with brown suit and sunglasses youre under arrest whats it all about the woman asked again her voice was not anxious but she was worried about the children never mind youll find out the policeman told her coldly one of those agitators making trouble here awright listen he peered at her with flinthard eyes you turn the car around and dont try any funny tricks hey our car will be in front and the van behind so watch out his voice was cold and threatening where are you taking us ive got to get my children to cape town i dont care about that he said you make trouble then you got to pay for it he looked back at the police car and waved a hand the driver of the police car started it up and backed and then turned into the road you follow that motorcar the policeman said were going back that way the woman said nothing but started her own car maneuvering it until they were behind the police car now you dont try any funny tricks the policeman said again she stared at him and her eyes were also cold now he went to the riottruck and climbed in the car in front of her put on speed and she swung behind it with the riottruck following where are we going mummy asked zaida are we going with those policemen ray asked you be quiet and behave yourselves the mother said driving after the police car the countryside redbrown and dusty moved past them the landscape they had passed earlier now slipping the other way the flat blue sky danced and wavered and the parched scrubstrewn scenery stretched away around them in the yellow glare of the sun i wish we had some coffee the little girl zaida said

arrived home from the city to be told by £ our cook as i entered the kitchen door that simon our houseboy had left home at noon and had not returned thic mean only one thing he had been arrested by the police i immediately got back into my car and drove down to alexandra township a special area set aside for nonwhites to live in which lay four miles from our home on the main pretoria road which lead to the city of johannesburg i had often been into the township on missions similar to the one i was now engaged upon so i knew what lay ahead it was  pm and the sun was just about ready to set which meant that within the half hour it would be dark a thought that did not make me very happy for the township at any time of the day was something to be avoided let alone in the evening when thousands of workers from the city were pouring into it fortunately the police station for which i was heading was not too far from the main road however the streets were unpaved slop water and heavy rains had eroded the surface and sides leaving deep ditches of three and four feet in place of gutters and huge ruts in the roadway this left very little room to drive a large american car i knew the chance i was taking if i inadvertently brushed one of the crowd or perhaps ran over a chicken a dangerous situation could arise and a possibility of even losing my lifeso great is the tension which exists today in south africa i drove carefully down the streets with bated breath trying to avoid the great big holes in the road the scrawny chickens emaciated dogs unkempt hungry children and the returning workers i had my revolver on the seat next to me in case of an emergency when brandishing it might have helped while the doors of the car were locked and the windows were closed i aroused considerable interest for not many whites driving alone entered the township especially women and at that time of the day some smiled with friendly eyes others were reluctant to give way as the car lurched drunkenly on the uneven road i arrived safe but slightly tense outside the police station where hundreds of africansmen women and childrenwere milling around outside on the street inside the grounds and in front of the charge office from the large crowd i knew that the police had had one of their intensive days of arrests as i said this was not a new experience i was continually on the hunt for some african male either from the factory where i worked or my own servants who had infringed one of the many laws which govern their lives but every time i entered a police station my heart twisted with pity as i gazed into the abject faces of those who had been taken prisoners and for those outside who had come to try and aid them since i was white they automatically made room for me some with sullen looks on their faces others with mere curiosity this was the time i felt ashamed of being white for without my white skin i would have had to take my turn which would have meant waiting for hours and then a hundredtoone chances are the waiting would in the end be in vain i entered the charge office through the entrance for whites and was not surprisedfor i had seen it oftento find a mass of humanity closely packed sitting on their haunches with hands clasped over their knees all over the floor a sea of black faces white eyeballs and tattered clothes there were about  prisoners all male in a space where fifty would be crowded three african policemen stood at the counter and a white sergeant sat at a desk laughing as he held the phone to his ear i quickly glanced at the prisoners to see if simon was among them he was a big grin on his face for he had seen me as i entered the office his teeth shone white his black face glistened with perspiration my mtdem he said sotto voice those who heard him smiled and shared his happiness for a brief moment for a white person meant attention the paying of the fine and freedomuntil the next brush with the law the sergeant replaced the telephone onto the receiver yes madam he said in afrikaans i answered him in the same language saying i wanted to know why my servant had been arrested he could hear that i was not afrikaansspeaking so he asked me in english to point out the prisoner which i did he beckoned simon and shouted to him in afrikaans to come forward which was rather difficult owing to the very confined space in which simon had been sitting poor simon bewildered by trying to work out how he was going to get from where he was standing to the desk became more harrassed when the sergeant rasped in afrikaans for him to hurry having no alternative but to step on those in front of him he made  his way to the desk they accepted being walked upon in silence for they knew the methods of the police by this time i was biting my tongue trying to avoid an argument for arguing with the police with regard to human feelings i had already found out was futile and usually made matters worse for me and the person i was trying to get released i could not however refrain from telling the sergeant that since the boy was from nyasaland he knew very little english and hardly any afrikaans for this info rmation i received a glare simon eventually stood in front of the sergeant the appropriate look of submission and humility on his round sweating facea look all africans have learned to use when dealing with the police if they fail to adopt this mien they are considered insolent and many times a swift working over by the guardians of the law will achieve this look which the police so much desire to see upon a blacks face meanwhile the sergeant was shuffling through masses of papers trying to find simons he located it looked at simon then looked at the charge sheet this boy is a foreign native he said yes i replied why was he arrested his papers are all in order well it seems madam he was picked up in the township why should he be arrested for that i asked mystified foreign natives are not allowed in the township it is against the law good grief i exploded surely there is not a law against that yes madam no foreign natives are allowed in the township and what is more he cannot sign an admission of guilt and pay a fine he must appear in front of the magistrate can i bail him out i queried oh yes but it is five pounds  and he must appear in court tomorrow morning at ten oclock i took the five pounds from my purse and laid it upon the counter fuming at the thought of how much this represented to an african the majority of africans working on the land and in the homes were lucky if they received this amount as a monthly wage simon was fortunate for i had the money and would pay it for him but what of the hundreds who did not they were sent to prison usually to a farm jail where they would serve a grim threemonths sentence working for the white farm owner and on their release if they were originally sentenced because their pass book was not in order they were immediately picked up by the police and the whole cycle was repeated the sergeant asked an african policeman for the bail book in which to record the five pounds but was told that a certain policeman had locked itin the safe taken the keys with him and had gone off duty receiving this information with a bland look he turned to me and said he was sorry but he could not take the bail for he did not have the necessary release book i was dumfounded and asked if this meant that my servant had to spend the night in jail yes he answered quite unconcerned i am afraid there is nothing i can do the sergeant concerned lives eight miles away and i even think he has gone out for the evening he shrugged his shoulders he cook the keys by mistake there is nothing i can do keeping my voice level and trying to remain composed i asked what would happen  others had the necessary fines or bail money nothing would happen theyll all have to spend the night in jail the book is locked up until eight oclock tomorrow morning he was not the slightest bit upset if my boy is allowed out on bail and i have the money i demand his release i shouted waving the five pound note under his nose just then a plainclothes detective entered the office and noticing i was upset he asked me what the trouble was i told him the story and ended up by saying with a great deal of feeling is there no justice at all in this country he was evidently senior to the sergeant for he told the sergeant that since i had offered the money for bail i was entitled to get the boys release furthermore since the african was employed by me they could in any case release him without bail on my responsibility providing i apeared the following morning in court at last i had simon on my side of the counter with nothing but the necessary promise to return the following morning the sergeant told one of the african constables to get simons bicycle which was recorded on the charge sheet and which he had been riding when arrested i then knowing the law asked what would happen to him if he rode the bicycle home it was already pitch dark and since he left the house at noon he had no light on the bicycle would he be arrested oh yes he answered it is against the law to ride without a light this meant a fourmile walk for simon pushing his bicycle i knew this would not interest the sergeant in the least so i refrained from making a remark now for the sixtyfour thousand dollar question i said with sarcasm since the police station is in the township and simon is a foreign african who is not allowed in is it possible that he can again be arrested on the same charge on his way out oh yes madam foreign na tives are not allowed in the township it is against the law then be so kind as to tell me how am i going to get him out i asked fit to burst i have no idea madam you must just hope that there are no police around he said very calmly by this time simons bicycle had been brought in and all i wanted to do now was to get out of the place for misery for those who had no help engulfed me looking at the bicycle i saw both tires had been deflated i asked why well we do this in case the boy tries to run away the detective said impatiently i looked at him in amazement all my life i had witnessed the arrest of africans but had never seen one run away who had actually been stopped perhaps if they saw the police in time and they were a good distance away they might make a dash for it but the south african police are wonderful marksmen and unless a man were really desperate most of them would never attempt to escape for fear of being shot i was disgusted and close to tears from utter frustration i asked for a pump so they could be reinflated sorry madam we do not have a pump was the sergeants reply as he turned to his desk a note of finality in his voice i had now spent one hour and fifteen minutes trying to obtain my servants release miserable and full of hate for those who allowed this to go on i told simon that we would try and get the bicycle into the car the trunk of the car was filled with suitcases and we managed eventually by leaving the one door open a few inches to squeeze the bicycle into the back it was necessary for simon to kneel on the front seat and hold the back door to keep it from flying open for we had no rope with which to tie it thus we traveled the four miles home on the way i asked simon why he went into the township no medem he replied me not in township when they catch me me going into township to by musick record but me not get there yet where did they arrest you then i asked outside medem on pretoria road they come ask for pass then tells me i must go police station did you ask them why i asked knowing full well that an african never asks a policeman why oh no medem the policie big skelms when you ask why i know my medem would come the next morning full of indignation for i had had the whole evening to brood on what had taken place simon and i set out for the alexandra police station arriving at the building that served as court which was close to the police station we joined the throng of milling people i made inquiries as to seeing the magistrate prior to his going into court and was told which office to enter we found a niche and stood watching the crowd there were at least three hundred africans standing around apart from the police and the officials i was the only white person young and old male and female stood in groups or singly all intent on trying to help or hear the worst the prisoners were hustled out from a wire cage which surrounded a small corrugated iron building large enough to hold perhaps thirty people with comfort i counted one hundred and twenty persons coming through the gates the bystanders as they recognized their friend or relative shouted in their own language causing quite a din the magistrate entered the office i told simon to remain where he was knocked at the door and was told to enter he was sitting at a desk reading a document which he duly completed before looking up to see who had entered i told him what had occurred the previous evening at the police station what he thought i do not know for he made no comments i then told him that my servant had intended going into the township but had not reached it when arrested thats his word against the police the magistrate stated in a terse voice i realize that does not count very much i said i am however inclined to believe my servants account of what had actually taken place to that of the police thats your prerogative i must go along with the police he stated flatly i then asked him how foreign africans were to know that it was forbidden them to enter the township were there notices put up in their language telling them of the law no he replied nothing is put up to inform them they usually find out the hard way i asked him if he thought this was justno warning given fining them more than a months wages for committing a crime they were not aware of that is not for me to say i am here to enforce the law and that is all i am concerned with trying to find out what else was against the law so that i could at least warn my servants i asked what was the ruling concerning the bus depot for this fell in the boundary of the township and all the buses terminated and ror menced their routes from there it is out of bounds for all foreign natives he replied in an irritated voice not to be discouraged i asked if my servant catches a bus at our home to go into johannesburg what must he do to be within the law to be able to complete his journey all the buses turned into  the township without stopping the last official stop being half a mile up the road well he replied i would say he can jump off the bus as it turns into the township and walk up to the next stop wait for it to come out and then continue is it not against the law to jump off a moving vehicle i asked in a sweet voice oh yes but that is the chance he must take was the enlightening answer or else walk a mile in other words i said whatever they do they are wrong including riding on a road outside of the township and being arrested for being inside of the township and being arrested for being inside of it and is that justice madam that is your boys story but to give him the benefit of the doubt let this serve as a warning to him and i will not prosecute in this instance he may go i thanked him and left the office stepping into the hot sun my vision blurred with tears at the thought of all those as innocent as simon who had no white person to help them some were real offenders but most were mainly infringers of the cursed pass laws the fines that were levied against them were way out of proportion to the pittance they earned as wages in many instances they were unable to pay and were then sentenced to three months imprisonment most of them ending up on the farm prisons this is an official means of forced labour to help the farmers who because of the low wages and other unattractive working conditions which they offer are unable to get help the last government statistics available for africans arrested for infringing the pass laws has just been published for the year  over three hundred and seventyfive thousand africans were arrested that year for contravention of the pass laws over a thousand per day these are not criminals merely unfortunate human beings with black skins who have wittingly or unwittingly not complied with the south african laws governing the black people

negro soldiers of ¦ i £ the unions th j j  massachusetts stared across charleston harbor at the church spires painted against a sunstreaked dusk federal bombardment had begun early that morning and clouds of smoke still hung overhead the air smelled of gunpowder and death foretold of violence and mans inhumanity to man the soldiers watched the parapets of fort wagner less than a mile away from where they lay hidden the union command considered charleston one of the prized targets of the confederacy and having massed  troops were determined to seize the city which was a provoking symbol to the north the citys southern aristocracy was inordinately proud of setting off the rebellion and firing the first shots of the civil war but this was not the only reason the city had to be stormed it had further strategic assets as a major port through which confederate armies were supplied from abroad fort sumter the federal bastion captured by south carolina troops at the start of the great and bloody conflict was the key to the harbor but maj gen quincy gillmore the union commander urgently needed fort wagner before he could blast sumter into submission the men of the th joked and laughed trying hard not to think of what lay ahead still there were little knots of fear in each man tension is normal with even experienced battlehardened troops but these men had never seen battle before not to any great extent having engaged in only one skirmish on nearby james island a few days before and here they werewould soon be called to take at bayonet point the strongest single earthwork ever constructed the men knew they were marked on james the confederates had swarmed upon them screaming with hate black flag no quarter no quarter the fanatic southerners had taken no prisoners from the regiment then nor would they willingly do so tonight for the th massachusetts was then the most controversial regiment on the face of the earth while its officers had been handpicked from prominent new england families its noncommissioned officers and men were negroes the first free negroes authorized by the war department each soldier lost in his own thoughts knew he would have to face more than confederate bullets he would also have to face deep and unreasonable resentment he was already facing that the southern papers were calling them apethings jeering that they will run like frightened black sheep at the first sight of their former masters nor was it much different in the north where many a negro had been senselessly attacked after leaving the recruiting station in fact the prejudice against the negro troops was so strong in many parts of the north that they had to be smuggled to the train one at a time to forestall future attacks little wonder that angels laugh at man    nevertheless out of the jeers and insults out of the brutality and laughter had come an intense pride in the regiment and in the grim challenge they faced sgtmaj lewis douglas son of the frederick douglass who hac escaped from slavery to became the most prominent negro abolitionist and publisher remembered the words his father had printed men of color to arms who would be free must themselves strike the blow and their own colonel the decorated robert gould shaw called the th as good a regiment as any that has marched    now colonel shaw walked among his men on the beach his trim figure outlined against the sand dunes he seemed young almost boyish despite the lines in his face and his stiff blond mustache his troops snapped to rigid attention as he approached but puffing on a cigar he motioned them to rest for two days they had had little sleep had eaten and drunk less and every moment of rest was precious the men had an intense devotion for shaw and many followed him with calls of good luck sir only  years old and a few years out of harvard shaw was already a battlehardened officer he had been severely wounded at antietam and had barely escaped death at winchester when a bullet struck his watch brig gen george c strong the ths brigade commander suddenly galloped up to the men it was he who had personally led the landings on morris island the week before he stood there now resplendent in full uniform the men rose to attention their sharp bayonets glistening in the last rays of the evening sun shaw and strong exchanged salutes strong spoke first you may lead the column if you want your men are worn out i know but you can do as you choose shaw could have refused with honor his men were exhausted and there would have been no taint had he declined the offer and placed the th in a supporting position for the attack his men crowded around shaw as he answered quietly i and my men will lead the advance sir and well carry the flag with us a thunderous cheer rang out from his men all along the line the men would fight how well would they fight that was a question still to be answered only two months before on may   boston had prepared a thunderous welcome for the th with crowds swarming around the common filling every sidewalk balcony and window along the route of march it seemed that half of massachusetts had packed itself into the heart of the city about  in the morning the watchers at the flagdraped corner of park square and boylston street heard the first rousing strains of the john brown song a few moments later the long blue column of soldiers with shaw at its head swung down the street boots beating against the pavement in perfect cadence  new enfield muskets at rigid rightshoulder symmetry william lloyd garrison the nations most outspoken abolitionist for  years watched the parade with tears rolling down his cheeks at the state house gov john a andrew and officials from all new england proudly greeted the regiment senator henry wilson said in his speech i do not know when in all human history to any given men in arms has been committed so proud a work so precious so full of hope and glory as the work committed to you fate must have smiled at these strong words for no one could laugh away or deny the dangers facing these colored soldiers the confederate government had already announced that any captured white officers of the th would be shot on the spot as for a negro soldier  if he somehow escaped being instantly butchered he would be sold into the living death of slavery further complicating the matter were political obstacles equally as severe as southern ruthlessness and brutality even president lincoln feared for a formation of a negro regiment would stir violent resentment among the border states while many war department officials considered the negro troops worthless the peace democrats of the north would have none of it declared the boston pilot in bold type they are as fit to be soldiers of this country as their abettors are to be its statesmen maintained many union officers why one southern regiment of white men could whip  regiments of niggers in an hour only after lincoln had issued the emancipation proclamation on jan   would he approve the formation of the th needless to say the eyes of the entire nationif not the worldwere on these men and for good reason there was a severe shortage of soldiermaterial of manpower in the north but there still remained the northern negroes the very last untapped source if the th could prove itself under the bloody baptism of southern fire the president would then recruit at least  new colored regiments the formation of the new regiment began governor john andrew who had championed the cause for the negro regiment chose shaw for one good reason the shaw family hated the southern system fervent abolitionists the shaws were almost the first people of wealth to make known their views against slavery shaw went at once to boston to launch a recruiting drive while frederick douglass led the movement in new york city his two sons lewis and charles were the first recruits come may th and the quota of the th was filled not only that but there were enough volunteers to form the nucleus of a second negro regiment the th this was not because of low recruiting standards quite the contrary shaws standards were high of  negroes from new bedford for instance only two could not read or write a record few white northern regiments could equal proudly shaw wrote his bridetobe the mustering officer tells me that he has never seen so fine a set of men though about  have passed through his hands since september an intense training period began secretary of war edwin stanton ordered the th to join general gillmores forces in the southern command but there was trouble ahead and shaw could see the signs antinegro copperhead factions demanding immediate peace with the south thundered that well kill ever damned nigger we gets our hands on and that includes the white trash that leads them shaw had planned to send the th to new york by train but later had his men moved south by ship after being warned by new yorks police commissioner that he could not be responsible for the regiments safety even riots threatened in boston in spite of that citys jubilant reception of may  shaw wisely ordered his rear guard to march through the city with fixed bayonets two hundred reserve policemen were held in readiness around the common but the vindictive antinegro factions made known their resentment in a more subtle manner residents pulled down their shades to hide the sight of colored troops the exclusive somerset club locked its doors and blacked out its windows on june rd the troops of the th landed at hilton head south carolina part of the complex  chain of coastal islands already held by union troops at once shaw had them parade through the dusty streets of hilton head their bayonets set their boots and leather highly polished other troopswhite troopsrushed to the streets in disbelief their mouths open in awe as the long blue column with drums beating and banners flying marched and wheeled in perfect precision soon the streets were lined with cheering spectators shaw was proud of his troops and they were proud of themselves and of him general gillmore planned a twopronged attack on charleston while brig gen a h terry made a diversionary strike at nearby james island gillmore landed  pieces of artillery parrott guns and siege mortars at one end of morris at the southern rim of the harbor by july  gillmore had gotten his artillery within  yards of fort wagner before the confederate counterattack stalled his plans two days before shaw had been ordered to take his men by boat to join general terry on james so on july   men of the th stood picket duty with the th connecticut regiment confederate general p g t beauregard who commanded the charleston area decided to do something about it reinforcements were rushed from other forts and the southerners struck that morning with five regiments supported by cavalry and artillery the th connecticut was quickly thrown back by the savage confederate attack not so with the th supporting it for over three hours the negro troops stood fast refusing to retreat as much as one inch one soldier later wrote to his mother the bullets were so thick that i could actually feel the wind of them it was a miracle that i wasnt killed the ths stiff stand and resistance gave the th connecticut time to pull back and reorganize wrote a war correspondent had the th given way had they fallen back the retreat of the th would have been cut off and they would have been completely annihilated later representatives of the th visited the ths bivouac to thank them and general terry sent shaw his personal commendation there was no time for celebrating however gillmore ordered terrys force from james to morris island for the major assault on fort wagner shaw had to march his men all night through a blinding rainstorm to cover the length of the island thunder rolled and jagged lightning knifed down from the angr heavens marching along a narrow path through swamps and underbrush the men had to march single file each man often holding the belt of the man in front branches clawed their faces and mud weighed their boots it took the regiment seven hours to cover the four miles to the embarkation point they fell to the ground exhausted that morning the th was carried by boat to morris island there was little doubt that soon in a matter of hours the negro soldiers would face their real baptism of fire shaw led his men on the final sixmile march up the sandy island to the front reaching their positions just before  pm other regiments having heard about the ths stand on james cheered wildly as the colored troops passed  am it was hot and the sky was cloudless general gillmore ordered the union guns to open fire on fort wagner it was one of the epic bombardments of the war as the fort was blasted with over  pieces for six hours brig gen william b taliaferro later estimated that almost  shells had been fired against his positions wagner was a strong fort built of palmettolog revetments with bombproofs holding  a deep moat protected its doublebastioned face there was only one approacha sandy spit narrowing just before the fort to only a few hundred feet huge naval guns and howitzers covered this approach  pound cannon and howitzers provided the flanking fire from two salients further firepower could be provided from confederate batteries on sumter james and sullivan islands even if the union troops reached the fort through the blistering fire they would still have to fight their way up a foot slope against a select corps of infantry and artillerymen for hours union shells tore great furrows in wagners embankment now and then confederate guns returned the fire by four oclock they no longer answered and general gillmore half convinced himself that the confederate artillery had been knocked out of action confederate general taliaferro was no fool actually he had sandbagged most of his guns from the very start of the union bombardment with the result that not one of his weapons had been as much as scratched his men tuckea in the bombproofs had suffered few casualties this was just one of the many union miscalculations now the wily  aliaferro brought his cannon back into position gillmore delayed his assault until dusk giving beauregard a few hours to rush reinforcements from the mainlandanother union mistake gillmore had planned the attack carefully having organized his force of  men into three brigades at  pm the th took its position at the head of the column with regiments from connecticut new york maine and new hampshire behind it shaw rode down the line and in a ringing voice told his troops the future of the negro soldier will be decided this night with gods help well plant the flag on wagners ramparts the attack was ready to be  launched but the union command had fumbled badly no plan of the fort or terrain was ever shown the regimental commanders it is doubtful if the high command ever knew about the sandy spit they would have to cross would be virtually cut in half by the tide one officer col h s putnum suspicious of the whole business was to remark we are going to be slaughtered like innocent sheep  pm darkness was very close the western sun burned but very faintly and a heavy fog was drifting in from the silent sea distant thunder rolled across the horizon  pm shaw ordered the th to attention he then reminded them that the confederate government had threatened to kill all captured negro troops men he said simply you will either have to take the fort or die there he drew his sword and his officers shook hands then shaws sword flashed downward the negro troops of the th massachusetts swarmed across the sand the march into hell had begun a march that would make negro history the men moved at quicktime at first then shaw shouted for doublequick not wanting to take any chances there was not sound no shot from the fort the men reached a point about  yards from the fort where the water cut the sandy spit in half confusion  now became the order of the day men were forced into the sea to their knees officers struggled to maintain formation but platoons and companies were hopelessly mingled together they struggled on toward the fort they were only  yards from the fort when wagners guns cut loose cutting the front lines to bloody pieces the regiment wavered for a small moment seemed to stop shaw plunged forward shouting onward onward the lines came to life and followed him the men of the proud th moved forward running now stumbling into holes made by cannon balls falling over tangled masses of their own dead hail after hail of grape and cannister shot poured into their lines and musket fire chopped down the attacking figures few troops had ever stood against such concentrated artillery fire in such a confined space death grinned fiendishly and black men were blown into eternity still they kept coming as shaw screamed charge but the confederates had more in store for the brave men of the th reb batteries on sumter sullivan and james islands now opened up with a terrible crossfire ripping the rear of the regiment to shreds and pinning down the regiments behind so that the colored soldiers were virtually isolated yet they continued to move toward death forty yards from the fort they ran into the moat in which water was four feet deep many of the men were caught and dropped by rifle fire from the ramparts others drowned the advance wave started up the dangerous slope of the parapet and from the top the st north carolina regiment fired down on them the charlestown battalion blasted them from the right salient the men of the th began going up the hellslope howitzers blew them into nothingness grenades knocked them back into the moat they did not retreat on and on they came determined not to retreat shaw and thirty of his men reached the top in a few minutes they fought in a circle with knives and bayonets as maddened southern infantry met them with musketbutts handspikes and gunrammers but the ths regimental flag had been planted on the slope the man carrying the national flag reached the top and was killed but sgt william carney caught the flag before it fell he managed to hold the flag aloft for  minutes before he was riddled with minnie balls four union officers crawled into an embrasure of the right salient killing the gun crew with their revolvers three other officers two of whom were killed a few seconds later even reached the left bastion of the inner fort the men at the fort could still hear shaw crying attack attack through the fire and smoke they could still see his sword slashing at the grayclad confederates surrounding him then he fell riddled with shot as his troops fought like demons around his body only to fall later around his lifeless form what was left of the th clung desperately to the slope sweeping the crest with their muskets victory was still possible at this point but the supporting regiments failed to follow through several regiments close behind the th could have taken the fort but instead only small units from the connecticut and new york reached the parapet and fought only briefly in one salient the rest of the brigade lay pinned down in front of the moat the momentum had been lost and only havoc and confusion remained on that thin strip of sand the dead and the wounded lay as one piled together in a ditch sometimes  in a heap strewn all over the place for threequarters of a mile of  members of the th in the attack almost half were killed wounded or missing the total union losses exceeded  men of eleven regimental commanders eight had been killed or wounded colonel shaws body was stripped of its uniform and his personal belongings stolen by southern soldiers general gillmore requested that the body be returned for a military funeral and was told by a confederate officer we buried him with his niggers confed erate gen johnson hagood told a captured union officer i would have given him an honorable burial had he been in command of white troops but since he wanted to lead nigger troops i had him buried with them in the common trench he led animals and i buried him with animals this scornful message was widely circulated in the north and newspapers screamed for revenge against southern sadism the plight of captured negro troops immediately became a very explosive issue south carolina demanded that five captured members of the th be turned over to the state by the military for trial under local slavery laws the men would either be shot or sold into slavery the north demanded action and action it got when president lincoln announced that a confederate soldier would be shot in retaliation for every u s soldier executed in violation of the war code lincolns stem announcement stopped the south and captured negroes as well as their white officers were consequently transferred to military stockades fort wagner became a national symbol said president lincoln it is a grave which will be sacred for all time to come proclaimed the new york tribune fort wagner has done for the colored race what bunker hill has for  years done for white yankees the battle for fort wagner had done more it proved to even the most dogmatic and bigoted of critics that negro troops could more than hold their own against the cream of the confederacy wagner was not finally captured until sept th but the brilliant record of the th persuaded the administration to speed up negro recruitment in the next  months more than  negroes were enlisted in the army of this amount  would eventually be killed wounded or missing almost  enlisted in the navy which had never had discrimination    the negroes of our own times can be proud of the th massachusetts regiment    yet there is a terrible sadness and a deep shame about all this which cannot be denied or ignored a sadness that perhaps still clings to the silent ghosts of those negroes who died at fort wagner fighting for freedom to those dark men who died in the spanish american war in world war i and world war ii a sadness and bitterness because while they fought and fought well and died wellthey still must see their living brothers held down as secondclass citizens under the very flag which is the world symbol for freedom the flag under which these silent ghosts once lived the very flag for which they died the deep shame should be felt by all men who would deny freedom and equality to others to those descendants of the men of the th massachusetts who so many many years ago fought and died and wrote negro history with their very blood
