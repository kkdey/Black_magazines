why television is a wasteland for negroes 
by dr william stuart nelson
he subject upon which t i have been asked to speak is in my judgment appropriate and timely it cannot be said i believe that higher institutions of learning are playing their full and proper role in affecting the trend of world affairs and if this impression is correct it should be changed it is especially to be regretted if such a criticism can rightly be brought against the colleges here represented it is my thesis that our colleges must break any remaining bonds of insularity and launch into the mainstream of thought pronouncement and action in relation to world trends this view is based upon the conception that college years are years when our young men and women are being ushered out of adolescence into adulthood are seeking a whole view of human affairs and are preparing themselves to participate in the complete life let us concede that during college years much remains to be done  in the shoring up process history and even life today have been unkind to many of our students and there remains the urgency of overcoming weaknesses in fundamentalsin reading writing and arithmetica task which the colleges will neglect at their peril this task the student must perform out of time and energy which youth not so shackled can employ in response to their personal tastes this obligation of remedying defects of earlier training must never be confused however with the true purpose of the college institutions of higher learning have among others two basic roles first to prepare their graduates for vocational and professional responsibilities and second to prepare them for their places as members of the larger society as responsible citizens of their country and of the world it is with this second obligation that i shall begin that is the obligation to educate for responsible citizenship we have not always been alert to this role the greeks placed a proper value on this responsibility indeed in greek cities where democracy prevailed those who did not participate in the life of the community were called idiots the kind of college we need today in relation to world trends is one that helps the student grasp the crucial facts about the modern world including the central importance to our lives of the nonwestern world it is disappointing to see the distinguished educator  dr oliver c carmichael commend an arts curriculum which includes only the basic concepts of the graecoroman world together with the judeachristian history literature and philosophy the fact is that we are all at this moment tied irrevocably to the asian and african communities whose cultures are also ancient and rich no man can call himself educated or prepared to stand in judgment upon modem world trends unless he brings to that judgment some solid acquaintance for example with the ancient cultures of china of india of africa including their contributions to philosophy religion art science and government until a few years ago we were left to learn about this area of our world by sheer happenstance and then not in the schools our colleges which do not repair swiftly their weaknesses in this respect will fail their students perilously a second fact which the college student must grasp today is that he lives in a revolutionary world perhaps the most farreaching and significent period of social revolution in all history men speak of the eastwest struggle the confrontation of the communist and the free worldby subtle implication the slave and the free world what faces us however is a world revolution begun in russia against a czarist and ecclesiastical regime and continuing more recently in the form of an ineluctable nationalism sweeping across the horizons of south asia and africa especially striking is the fact that for centuries western european countries held in colonial bondage the people of a large part of the worlds surface the sun never set on the british empire during the past fifteen years this picture has changed one experience of my life  shall never forget it is that of midnight on august   when i witnessed in india the ceremony marking the passing of the ruling power from the hands of the british to those of three hundred and fifty million indians everyone will remember his excitement on the day ghana in  became free and attest to his deep satisfaction as one after another of the african states moved from colonial to a selfgoverning status today wherever there is suppression there is also the spirit of revolt it may now be in the smouldering stage if however suppression continues there is a question only of the day and the hour when the will to be free will burst into flames a third fact in relation to world trends is the search by wise and deeply concerned men for the discovery of a moral and spiritual force equal to the problems of a one world and a revolutionary world scientific advance in the field of armaments has accentuated this search so eminent an american as james reston washington correspondent of the new york times has expressed his concern as follows for perhaps the first time in history reflective men have to grapple with the pacifist question can national interests and human values really be served by waging a war with atomic and hydrogen weapons the washington post in a recent editorial discussed the tragic possibility of the destruction by modern weaponry of the irreplaceable genetic material in the human race and declared that our thinking today must rise to a plane as far above that of the past as modem weapons are above the cave mans club that wise men are seeking a new solution to our world tensions and are turning their eyes in the direction of a moral and spiritual solution is encouraging the tragedy lies in the fact that a power equal to our unhappy state has long been available only to be praised and forthwith ignored i refer to the great principle of the universal ethic the meaning of which is that men are brothers children of one creator each possessing a likeness to his father god chief albert luthuli of south africa is a dramatic example of the cementing power of a spirit dedicated to the removal of human injustice by the activist though nonviolent pressures brought to bear courageously and persistently upon the consciences of the south african agents of a ruthless suppression sentenced to confinement in his native village chief luthuli was lifted into world eminence by his selection two years ago as the recipient of the nobel peace prize here is a happy illustration of the moral influence upon the world mind and conscience of a quality of thinking and acting which can lift us far above the present level of fear and conflict the picture of the college which i wish to see is one then which leads its students to comprehend these facts of life  that our world is not a western world and an eastern world is but one world each portion of which is capable of enriching the life of the other  that our world is in revolution and that no man can play his proper role without understanding this and acting in the light of that understanding and  that in answer to the question as to where we shall find the power to redress the balance between the haves and the have nots the weak and the powerful we can look to the possibilities of a force lifted up in recent years for the world to see by such spirits as mahatma gandhi martin_luther_king and chief albert luthuli to the responsibility of guiding students in the interpretation of the major facts of our modern world the college has the duty of developing the spirit of objectivity in their interpretation to contribute constructively to the solution of world problems even in a small way men must be guided by a spirit divorced from blind hemispheric national  and racial loyalties freed from servile political affiliation and committed to the employment of those forces available in man himself    we live and teach today necessarily under some restriction there is a difference however between living on the frontier of ones restrictions on the one hand and on the other of living and acting well within those frontiers where the risks are minimum living on the frontier of course requires conviction and courage i emphasize this point of courage in our colleges for we as a people live at a juncture in history where great decisions are required of us we are a people who have suffered at the hands of power vested in the greedy the mean the morally perverse and the politically timid we are an emerging people the kind of people we are destined to become rests to a large degree on the kind of graduates we send into the world i am arguing here therefore that the kind of image our colleges present to the world should not be one of qualifying students for a prosaic ab or bs what i have in mind is not on merely the mastering the facts about our world about which i have spoken i am deeply concerned with the developing college generations which will be seized with the thirst for truth and the courage to speak and act upon it    we as a people are on the threshold of political power which can prove determinative on a world basis let us hope that many of our college students of today will be the political leaders of tomorrow if for no reason other than that we have suffered so grievously at the hands of the political demagogue supporting his social and racial prejudices our colleges should be willing to pay the price it costs to develop a future generation of responsible honest free political leaders let us compare a mississippi in a james meredith situation under its present political leadership with that under the leadership of a future generation with the moral courage of the student editor at the university of mississippi who recently stood her ground and spoke the truth as she saw it in the presence of the harassments of her fellow students we have before us here two entirely different worlds i come now to the obligation of the college to prepare students for vocational and professional opportunities even obligations in relation to world affairs including those where the element of service is central fortunately the opportunities in this area are increasing several years ago the president of howard university and i were invited to discuss with officials of the department of state the means by which a greater number of qualified negro college graduates might be encouraged to take the foreign service examinations more recently i was visited by a department of state official on this same mission concern i know is being felt by our colleges and a careful search is being made for a solution to this problem with some regularity now we read or hear of significant appointments to positions in the foreign service which have included three on the ambassadorial level the peace corps presses for more applications from our colleges with the expressed possibility that peace corps experience may serve as a stepping stone to appointments in the foreign service attractive opportunities are also increasing in other than government service technical competence is being sought at an accelerated pace by private companies engaged in expanding developmental operations overseas such competence is now being sought in our own institutions unhappily the positions available in the educational institutions of newly independent countries are greater in number than can presently be filled by competently trained personnel among us as we all know there has been the dedicated achievement of education for negroes in assisting newly emerging freedmen to acquire those skills enabling them to use their freedom responsibly equally meritorious has been the effort of our colleges to equip their graduates with those professional skills with which to meet the demands of a highly restricted community it can be said that this education ad ministered and received under conditions with which we all are acquainted has been of such quality as to mark an heroic epoch in the higher education of negroes but the walls of restriction are being slowly broken down no longer is the professional and technical skill of the negro in demand alone within the confines of a restricted community his talents are being eagerly sought on a world scale this fact calls for a basic reexamination of our college curricula and a questioning of the continuing exclusive emphasis upon traditionalism we shall continue to train doctors lawyers ministers teachers with a thoroughness that will make them second to none at the same time we must be alert to the vastly increasing categories of skills and vocational opportunities which will be available to the graduates of the s little dreamed of a few years ago this means that for years to come given the realities within which we live there will be a large although decreasing need for our education to minister to special deficiencies in our students preparation it is to be hoped however that this special obligation will with impressive speed give way so that our curricula may be conceived on a basis sufficiently broad to meet the demands of a world where competence not color will be the overriding criterion in this new preparation for our  students we must bear in mind the obligation to help them identify themselves intimately with the people they may be destined to serve and with their  needs    thus the wider opportunity beckons our problem is to answer it in quality and in quantity we here know the problems our college students face the sacrifices attendant upon getting to college and finishing the urgent need for proceeding upon professional preparation for getting to work parents are exhausted and need support marriage beckons or having already been entered upon cries for steady employment all this and more the hard fact of life however is that while the world may recognize our problems it cannot by any miracle solve them our past and the liabilities it has laid upon us are a part of the present with which we must deal nor do we wish that society lower its standards to suit our situation in short the burden is upon both to press for wider opportunities and to qualify for those presently at our door the call is for still more sacrifice to add to that of our already one hundred years of freedom for harder work than the average less play than the rule for sterner self discipline in brief the call is for the heroic and the colleges in my view are the places supremely to instill this ideal and to summon our youth to embrace it 
the boston ? story
by james r phillips
ate on the night of f t l december   young negro folk singja er jack washington ii  i was walking along a boston street minding his own business when suddenly two boston police officers stopped him and insisted that he submit to a search of his person the reason given they suspected he might be carrying tools to pry open parking meters they admitted that they had no reason to suspect him and so negro digest june  washington a student at emerson college refused to submit to such an invasion of privacy according to a charge sworn out later by washington under oath the policemen brutally assaulted him he was badly banged up and the physical appearance of the two policemen substantiated their counter complaints that he had rendered quite a good account of himself before being subdued up until now it might sound like this is quite a setback for the cause of civil liberties for negroes    but wait there is more almost immediately bostons highly influential republican news paperthe prestigious boston heraldblasted the boston police with a powerful lead editorial that proclaimed there is here the question of whether the police officers by their own unwitting admission violated washingtons constitutional right to be free from unreasonable search of his person the officers told the court that they needed to search washington to determine if he had meterbreaking tools in his pocket he did not but the abroadinthenight statute under which they stopped him for questioning does not authorize any such search for evidence nor could it constitutionally all searches are unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional unless they are made with a search warrant or incident to a lawful arrest the police had no warrant to search washington and he was not arrested until after he was searched and then for an offense other than that for which the search was conducted    the assault charge was substituted later it is necessary    that lawabiding citizens be able to go abroad at night without being subject to arbitrary search and even assault and battery let the trial board hearings on the policemens conduct proceed here is the kind of prompt community demand for the equal protection of negro civil_rights that is now becoming commonplace in boston and it is typical of the exciting new gains being registered by negroes in boston in recent weeks three other developments of major importance to negroes have unfolded in boston here they are item negro lawyer edward w brooke former chairman of the boston finance commission was elected to the powerful post of attorneygeneral of massachusetts the only republican to survive a democratic sweep led by the presidents brother the nowsenator teddy kennedy item negro rt rev john m burgess was consecrated suffragan bishop of the protestant episcopal diocese of massachusetts the first time a negro has been elevated to such an important position in a predominantly white protestant episcopal community he has vowed to work for greater social justice in racial matters item such negro leaders as mrs muriel snowden director of the famed freedom house were credited with having played a major planning role as the city revealed plans for a sweeping public and private renewal program in the heavily negropopulated roxbury district of boston these three rapidfire developments are actually quite consistent with bostons early traditions boston itself was created in  by a large and wellfinanced expedition of nonconforming protestant dissenters from england the leaders of this group included some of englands richest and best educated men they founded harvard college almost immediately to make sure that the infant settlement would be guaranteed a steady supply of leaders to carry on their traditions the major concerns of these early settlers were housing religion and lawsironically the same three areas in which major breakthroughs have just come for negroes in boston the breakthroughs themselves merely reflect a rebirth of the progressive ideals brought to the new world by those early setlers bostons biggest export in its early days was its moral conscience but for many years yankee bostons old nonconformist and revolutionary traditions seemed to be buried under the customs of newcomers now a definite rebirth of the traditional boston spirit has occurred circumstantial evidence hints at the possibility that the negroes arriving from the south mostly as were the original settlers  protestants seeking individual liberty and equal opportunity have contributed importantly to this renaissance in boston but whatever the cause it is a fact that the old spirit of liberty has been rekindled in what had become stuffy and conservative bostonso much so that boston newspapers radio stations and tv stations have begun using the phrase the new boston to describe the exciting new spirit now sweeping through the city it may be expected that this boston spiritwhich aims at lifting negroes up to full equality will spread and have national effects the most obvious place to look for national effects of the new boston spirit is in the federal government president kennedy who is himself a bostonian has already issued an executive order banning discrimination in certain federally aided housing it may be expected that he will seek more civil_rights legislation and it is likely that he will be far more successful in this now with bostons own congressman john mccormick as powerful speaker of the house than he might have been with speaker sam rayburn from segregationist texas but the boston spirit is hardly confined to government activity indeed the tradition of boston from the first nonconforming setlers through the revolution was sharply antibig government far more important is the subtle but decisive influence the citys spirit has on anyone who comes into contact with it private individuals moving into positions of leadership in nongovernment activities can  do far more good through moral leadership than mere laws can do by themselves take for example rev martin_luther_king coming from georgia he studied at the divinity school of big private and protestantbacked boston university when he won his graduate degree a few years ago he went back down south he had been greatly influenced by his experiences in the new boston his work since then in organizing the first really successful negroled drive for equal rights in the south is widely known but less widely known is the role that bostons spiritual traditions played in shaping this man there will undoubtedly be many more cases of indirect influence by boston on todays accelerating drive towards equal rights for negroes in the nation as a whole as proof of this likelihood you need only consider these past examples of how major social and moral movements bom in traditionally nonconformist boston quickly spread to embrace the nation  the old north christ episcopal church was established in boston this church later to be famous because two lanterns were hung in its tower to signal paul revere buried negroes together with whites in its underground vaults it was a bold move for its time showing as it did a belief in multiracial social equality  defense attorney james otis jr stunned his feuow  boston citizens as he proclaimed during a key testcase trial before the british admiralty court that all men are born with natural rights of libertyand that no king or parliament can legally take away these equal rights the implications of the speech were immediately apparent to all concerned carried to their logical conclusion such views would render illegal not only imperial restrictions on shipping but also slavery as well  a free negro sailor named crispus attucks was shot down in cold blood by british troops in the boston massacre he was the first american to die in what history later showed was really the opening skirmish of our revolutionary war  the massachusetts supreme court outlawed slavery because of the words in the states bill of rights which stated all men are born free and equal  a new century dawned and the fever of reform suddenly swept boston again veterans of battles at lexington concord and bunker hill began agitating for the abolition of slavery their slogan became we fought for freedom of all men black as well as white  crusading editor william lloyd garrison established a newspaper in boston devoted to prompting abolition mounting interest in this cause led to the formation of the first abolition society in boston in  a year later spreading interest led to the formation of other societies and then a national abolition society flaming speeches against slavery began drawing large crowds to boston auditoriums  a young whig lawyer from illinois abe lincoln by name visited boston and heard an evening of abolitionist speeches lincoln up till then a fencesitting moderate noted for his logic found his lifes emotional cause he was to be totally won over to the abolitionist movement later he joined the new republican party and his extreme views won him the label of black republican upon his election to the presidency southern states immediately began seceding from the union his civil war victory fulfilled bostons abolitionist cause following the civil war boston underwent a transformation after  years of leadership in the cause of liberty it sank into a conservatism that at times bordered on being reactionary the onceprogressive yankees fighting to hold their power against rising tides of irish jewish and italian immigrants seemed to forget their proud heritage as guardians of americas most exciting traditionsnonconformity dissent revolution and abolition but then more recently a seeming miracle occurred an unspoken truce was declared in the battles between old yankee and new immigrant stock perhaps it was the pleas for social justice from the small but growing negro community but at any rate something pricked bostons conscience catholics protestants and jews began burying their antagonisms yankees irish italians jews chinese and negroes began joining together in seeking to build a new boston the newness was visible to the naked eye in the form of new buildings but even more significant was the newness not visible to the eye this was a new spiritan electric feeling that one could only sense crackling through the air now this new spiritreally a very old spirit come back home to boston againis bringing very real gains to negroes late in  it was the election of attorneygeneral brooke the elevation of rt rev burgess and the announcement of coming major improvements in housing opportunities it may be expected that  will see further significant gains and it is possibleeven probablethat negroes in boston will make more progress towards full equality in the next ten years than in the last hundred years put together new leaders are arising leaders in the tradition of james otis jr crispus attucks and william lloyd garrison there is bound to be opposition from some stubborn individuals just as there was a minority opposition in boston to such earlier movements as the revolution and abolition but history showsespecially the history of movements bora in bostonthat once a new spirit of liberty and justice is loose in a community it can never again be contained and it will ultimately triumph if the history of earlier bostonborn movements is any guide the recent major gains for negroes in boston presage total equality of opportunity for negroesfirst in boston and then in the nation as a whole 
forgotten

h youre wearing two ties delightedly little fouryearold lillian toyed with the two ends of the visitors deep down inside the visitor felt a sharp twinge of pain strangely his eyes smarted for a moment it just wasnt possible to avoid the emotion that came with the realization that this lovely wideeyed youngster has yet to have the opportunity to enjoy such simple things as playing with her fathers necktie fingering his cufflinks listening to the tick of his watch across the hall a young nurse rushed into a room to pick up and cuddle chunky little  monthold alfred her practiced eye had spotted little a starting to rock himself back and forth in his crib the usual preliminary when lonesome infants deprived of the real love they need are about to start hitting their heads against the side of their crib a few feet away at a tiny table and chairs three bright delightful youngsters about two to three years of age were having lunch the table presided over by even cuter fouryearold norma norma had volunteered to help the nurses by helping the youngsters eat their lunch her reward a feeling of importance of being neededand a lollypop these are just a few of the forgotten  per cent these are just a few of the hundreds of infants in new york foundling hospital  third avenue new york city they are but a tiny representation of the more than  youngsters in homes and orphanges across the united statesyoungsters whose yesterdays todays and tomorrows hold little in the way of hope for them to achieve real contentment real happiness a real home life these in this nursery are some of the more than  negro youngsters whose futures are in serious doubt today for somehow beyond all understanding in these days of great concern for equality individual liberty social welfare  and human rights the plight of these children seems to have escaped the notice and concern of almost everyone except a compara tively small number of dedicated professional men and women and social workers true these untiring people try diligently desperatelyand succeed in a good measure to make institutional life substitute for the warmth and love that only a foster home can offer but equally true children even as the birds and animals of the woodsare given parents at birth parents to help them teach them develop them to love them until they are sufficiently strong to face the world around them this is simply a natural law how then can the staffs of the childrens institutions be expected to fulfill the parents roles why should these temporary guardians be left with the impossible problem of trying to be to these youngsters something they cannot never were intendedto be the real tragedy of these beautiful foundling infants and toddlers is the fact that specialists in the field of child care and placement have determined that unless these children are placed in private foster homes by the age of four they are almost certain to endure an institutional life until they reach legal age for the sad proven fact is that having lived an institutional life from birth a child older than four years of age has lived with institutional routines and constantly changing nursing shifts and social worker staffs for so long that he many times accepts the feeling that he doesnt belong to anyone that somehow he is different when this occurs he automatically defensively shuts out the world at large and placement in a foster home can produce an emotional shock which could have a profound effect upon the youngsters entire future life and thinking these facts may come as a surprise to some readers an even greater surprise may be this many people think the youngsters in institutions are there because no one wants to adopt them but the fact is of the institutional population of more than  children only two per cent are available for adoption ninetyeight per cent of the children are not subject to adoption for some legal reason they are wholly dependent upon the authorities who help to shelter them their destinies until adulthood are almost drab and hopeless unless prospective foster parents come forth and open their hearts and their homes to the children walk into the immaculately clean bright cheerful nurseries of new york foundling hospital or any other childrens home or hospital look at the cherubic lovable fouryearolds like norma how great the tragedy that at their ripe old age time is running out for them time and the golden opportunity for a carefree child hood full of family friends sunshine and the many other vital necessities of childhood realize for a moment that these are just a few more names in the roster of the forgotten  per cent lend a hand for a moment to help little threeyearold jack out of his snowsuit the nurse has just returned him after a minute walk in the world of roaring automobiles exciting street noises gaily dressed people romping neighborhood childrenthe world of young people with hopeful futures watch jack walk off as he tries to find a new interest which in the confines of the nursery can help him retain the excitement and pleasure of his short outing into the wonderful world outside everything that can be done is being done for these youngsters by skilled social workers nurses doctors psychologists and psychiatrists child welfare agencies and volunteers but nothing can be a substitute for the love the warmth the affection and understanding that children such as these can receive from foster mothers and foster fathers perhaps the most dramatic evidence of the great difference between the institution and the foster home comes as the sun sets and day turns to night stand at the end of the corridor in new york foundling hospital as the good sisters of charity and crisp warmhearted nurses tuck in for the night the  tiny tenants of nursery f now listen a plaintiff cry comes from tommy in one corner of the nursery a whimper from little jeanie in another corner a sob from little marian in another section of the nursery the head nurse knows that these few little cries in the dimly lighted nursery can upset the rest of the youngsters and cause a babble of heartrending cries and sobbing she moves silently swiftly from one end of the corridor to the other flicking switches on machines strategically placed at each end what are the machines they are sonotone securitones what do they do they reproduce and amplify throughout the nursery the recorded sound of the beat of a mothers heart this then must suffice to put the children at ease this must substitute for the loving caress of a foster mothers hand must pacify as would a softly crooned mothers lullaby can it be that many tens of thousands of lovable youngsters like these face a life confinement to institutions is it possible that so many capable couples across the nation fail to realize the wealth the treasure the happiness and fulfillment that these infants and toddlers can bring into their home is it not the greatest of ironies that child welfare agencies across the nation search desperately day and night to find foster homes for these infants who offer so much and yet the authorities are forced to admit that the results of their efforts are disheartening the irony these agencies are offering to prospective foster parents  to  and sometimes more in monetary allowance for each youngster taken in plus medical care and clothing yet sadly sufficient numbers of prospective foster parents fail to come forward for every ounce of common sense and human feeling would dictate that prospective foster parents would outnumber the children many times over qualifications for foster parents are simple in essence the couple need be only normal compassionate human beings they need not have a college education nor a higher income than their neighbors whether or not they have children of their own is unimportant nor is age an important factor for information regarding foster parents or volunteer work with foundling agencies address inquiries to home finding department new york foundling hospital  third ave new york  ny

possibly in order to appease certain groups agencies and individuals the television networks have recently caused a rash of negro performers to be seen on our screens mainly on major programs at prime viewing hours these guests have been a welcome sight and on one or two dramatic shows have given praiseworthy accounts of themselves this trend cannot last however because the persons chosen have all been famous and prominent personalities whose major careers lie well outside the regular scope of television lena horne dorothy dandridge sammy davis jr ray charles leontyne price mahalia jackson nor can this type of appearance satisfy those who long for more representation of the negro	in the areas of television that are less spectacular guest appearances on variety programs panel shows chitchat hoursfrequently at fantastic pricesmay be a good beginning but certainly not the final objective what is desired it seems to me is less representation at the showcase or entertainment level and more representation at what might be called for lack of a better term the functional levels of television its commercial and educational areas more regulars than itinerants is one way of stating the problem television has used to advantage lately albeit with some timidity the area in which itinerants can be of significant value that is the area of acting in the halfhour and hourlong dramatic series in these negro actors have appeared in roles of doctor nurse teacher social worker policeman soldier and sometimes merely as a decently dressed passerby the one drawback is the fact that almost without exception these bit parts are taken by outstanding negro actors and actresses whose previous achievements on stage and screen are head and shoulders above those of their tv colleagues what for instance is ossie davis doing in car  where are you i am not familiar with statistics on the availability in this country of negro actors and actresses but i am sure they number more than the half dozen or so players we see tossed  about from one network to another in the course of a year someone pointed out to me that we cannot have our cake and eat it too that either we must have walkon parts with dignity and silence or have major roles and be garrulous and obsequious a la beulah and amos and andy would that our indignation at remarks of this kind could be passed on to tv writers leaving this area which is solving its own problems with all deliberate speed i should like to suggest the use of the negro potential in the commercial and educational areas of television areas as yet untouched and unexplored perhaps because unsought by us here it must be made plain that i speak as an observer only with no inside knowledge of the complexities of television commercialism i am concerned with what i along with several million other people see or do not see daily on my television screen advertising the principle of separate but equal has long been a part of american advertising as the annals of several negro magazines can attest a partial list of the products which advertise in magazines supposedly reaching only the negro community yet which are major sponsors or advertisers on television follows beverages cocacola pepsicola pabst schlitz millers toothpastes crest ipana gleem cigarettes kent winston viceroy salem lucky strike chesterfield foods kraft pet milk nabisco sealtest campbells transportation greyhound goodyear firestone general motors ford beauty products helene curtis maybelline ponds the above list was compiled from one issue of a national negro magazine each product is a constant television advertiser it should be noted that only those products are mentioned whose television commercials are in decent if not in good taste which automatically excludes certain personal items which have lately run rampant on our screens and alcoholic beverages which of course are not allowed television advertising each of these products is promoted by a negro in the magazines the commercial is exactly the same as it appears on the screen except for the exclusion of whites and the inclusion of negroes i am sure that for an occasional commercial this principle could work as well on the inch screen as in magazines the negro market is increasing constantly at a rather rapid rate and the business world is quite aware of this a selective buying campaign directed against those commercials which are twofaced would bring tangible results quickly enough things need not come to that pass however since commercials lately pretend to be unrehearsed natural and as american as apple pie catching housewives at work ordinary laborers in moments of relaxation picnickers and other happy unsuspecting subjects negroes are as available for this sort of advertising as anybody else each company of any size and importance has several commercials which alternate certainly one or two of these could utilize a negro or negroes especially for such products as beverages cigarettes private cars telephones and the wide range of home products may they spare us from the general quality of detergent commercials however which has reached an alltime low speaking of detergent commercials there was once a product in which a negro promoted the qualities of her favorite laundry soap or starch or whatever she was discovered ironing as the commercial progressed however it became clear that she was ironing for miss somebody who never failed to congratulate her on how soft her sheets felt miss whoeveritwas could never get them that clean herself it goes without saying that this bit of objectionable advertising was soon withdrawn i advocate its reappearance with a new emphasis that the negro woman mrs   is in her own home ironing her own laundry for the benefit of her own family like millions of housewives do daily the world over with or without a dog named siegfried news two of the three major television networks have recently hired one negro reporter each bully for them newscasting and interviewing are major functions of television for regular reporting of the news of the day the minute segments between  and  pm the nation expects and currently has certain permanent newscasters there is reason to desire the employment of a negro eventually to read off the headlines during the midmorning and midafternoon abbreviated news segments negro reporters are desperately needed where and when national and local events have made interviews with negro citizens necessary this is especially true in crises real or anticipated resulting from problems of desegregation north and south no doubt many of us are almost driven to despair when the typical white interviewer approaches one of our brave standard bearers and asks after momentary embarrassing hesitation were you put up to this by the naacp or in the case of students who have been attending colleges and universities with token integration who have been your best friends male or female students or the most mistaken and yet most insidious of all just what did you hope to gain by all this this is not responsible reporting and certainly does not get that rapport between interviewer and  interviewee which is desirable there are in this country excellent negro researchers reporters photographers capable of handling with all ease and effectiveness documentaries of many types particularly those which deal with our own segment of the population we should press strongly for their employment and use by the major television networks there are other areas in this medium where the employment of negroes would be a national asset educational television is one it is strange that national educational television which does not have even that patched and constantly ravelling skirt of southern opposition which as they grow up the commercial networks seek to hide behind less and less utilizes the negro to such a small extent i have yet to see a negro instruct a class for credit via educational tv and yet what are we if not teachers national educational television the one medium in the nation best equipped to dispel the notion that the negro is not under the spell of the bad fairy and is condemned to sing and dance himself into oblivion is tacitly promoting that fiction in short then this vast wastelandincluding both its commercial and educational networks could use some of its neglected human potential to create oases designed for the mutual comfort and uplifting of us all 
toward a goal of full racial justice
by the most rev lawrence j shehan dd catholic archbishop of baltimore md
christ in the month of november  the bishop of this country at their annual meeting issued a statement entitled discrimination and the christian conscience after noting the rather remarkable progress made by our negro fellow citizens particularly during and after the second world war toward such goals as political equality fair edcational and economic opportunities good housing without exploitation and a full chance for social advancement the bishops went on to say that in more recent years the issues have become confused and the march toward justice and equality has been slowed if not halted in some areas the transcendent moral issues have become obscured and possibly forgotten the heart of the race question they declared is moral and religious it concerns the rights of man and our attitude toward our fellow man if our attitude is governed by the great christian law of love of neighbor and respect for his rights then we can work out harmoniously the techniques for making legal educational economic and social adjustments but if our hearts are poisoned by hatred or even by indifference toward the welfare and rights of our fellow man then our nation faces a grave internal crisis    within this household of the faith this temple holy to the lord this dwelling place of god in the spirit this mystical body of christ there can be no room for racial discrimination and the bitterness and rancor that inevitably grow out of it in this year when the minds and hearts of men are turning longingly and hopefully toward the goal of christian unity it is particularly important that justice and charity without any discrimination or prejudice or antipathy should shine brightly within the church of christ there is we knowand there can beonly one center of christian unity christ and his mystical body but how can that body be recognized for what it is unless there is within it unity without division or dissension and unless within and between its members there shine the   justice and charity of christ within the time and space available to me in this letter it is impossible to set forth in detail the extent and the nobility of the duty of f justice and charity incumbent upon us as members of christs mystical body under the circumstances m of today however it may be useful if i attempt to state briefly the minimum that is required of us as members of christs church in this archdiocese there is i hope no need to say that in our churches and in our parochial life generally there must be not only no racial segregation but also no distinction of rank or place i or treatment based upon racial difi ference    because we are  members one of another    do   not grieve the holy spirit of god  in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption ephesians   for now the justice of god has been made manifest    through faith in jesus christ upon all who believe for there is no distinction as all have sinned and need the glory of god romans  in our schools both elementary and secondary the same general policy holds as catholic schools they are meant primarily although not exclusively for catholic studentsfor all catholic students insofar as facilities can be made availablewithout racial or any other discrimination this means that in the registration of students a common policy approved by our catholic school board must be followed in the case of all catholic children living within the boundaries of every parish fortunate enough to have its own school the same policy must govern all transfers from one school to another within the school identical academic standards must apply to all students and all must be treated with equal justice and charity in our diocesan organizations and institutions of charity a sincere effort has been made over a period of years to eliminate discrimination and to effect true integration longstanding social and cultural patterns have at times made this process difficult with the opening of the new st vincents home we believe that the last traces of discrimination in this field will have disappeared it is some months now since all our catholic hospitals gave formal approval and acceptance to the policies of nondiscrimination i specifically proposed this means that they have agreed to admit and treat applicants for medical and surgical service without distinction in their outpatient departments to follow the same procedure in admitting patients into the hospital and in assigning beds to them that there shall be no discrimination practiced in handling applications for membership on medical surgical and nursing staffs that advancement within each staff will be  governed only by ability training experience and character that a policy of integration and nondiscrimination is to be effective for all employees of the hospital in older and outmoded hospital plants it has sometimes been difficult to eliminate some customs based on ageold prejudices and social patterns but now that the last of our hospitals is acquiring a modern building we are confident that the final traces of segregation and discrimination will disappear some of these policies have been in effect in each of these fields for a long time we do not claim that any of them go beyond mere justice i have spelled them out in some detail because of questions which have been raised from time to time the duty of justice and charity applies not only to our churches our schools our charitable organizations and institutions and our hospitals but also to all of us as individuals it must guide us in our personal relationshipswithin our block our neighborhood our community in our social and fraternal organizations in the business we may conduct in the labor unions to which we may belong at work and at play in all the circumstances of everyday life particularly lamentable is the unreasonable and automatic panic too often fanned by unscrupulous and disreputable real estate brokers and speculators which accompanies the arrival of a negro family in an area previously occupied by white families only the flight that occurs not only unfairly prejudges the new neighbors but it also works an economic hardship on departing property owners destroys the community undermines church life and hits hard at substantial investments made in schools rectories convents and recreational facilities as well as in the actual places of worship    nor can we afford to overlook the crippling effect that division and dissension within our community have on our efforts to meet what is perhaps the most alarming problem of this and every other large city of the country crime this is not the place to go into the sources or causes of crime within our midst suffice it to say that no part or group of our people has a monopoly on those sources or causes what should concern us is that the problem is so great as to call for the best minds and the combined intense and persistent efforts of the ablest leaders of all elements within the community in saying this we reflect in no way on the police force of either city or state on the contrary we have complete confidence in the integrity and ability of both the heads and the ranks of our police departments but this problem is one that requires the continuing scrutiny and efforts of the community as a whole it will not be met adequately if there is dissension division suspicion between the two chief racial groups of our citizens even to enumerate our present duties and policies brings vividly to our minds our past defects those defects we frankly admit with humility and regret we catholics must acknowledge that we have been all too slow in the correction of our shortcomings although in the light of the experience of many of our forefathers we should have been particularly sensitive to the unjust inequalities suffered by other groups for this reason we have a special obligation to place ourselves in the forefront of movements to remove the injustices and discriminations which still remain we are all aware of the present grave social problems which have had their origin in racial prejudices and tensions and which are fed by longstanding racial antipathies these problems cannot be suddenly solved or wiped out by wishful thinking or good intentions they are community problems they therefore cannot be successfully met by any one part of the community nor any one group however highminded and earnest they call for the combined thought and planning and cooperation of all of us they require patience and understanding and good will and persistent effort on the part of everyone they call for a sense of justice above all in that part of the community in which the evil had its origin and a spirit of charity on both sides in their  statement the bishops of this country while calling for concrete plans for the elimination of discrimination and the establishment of equal justice and opportunities urged that such plans be based upon prudence the virtue which inclines us to view problems in their proper perspective the problems we inherit today they noted are rooted in decades even centuries of custom and cultural patterns when we are confronted with complex and farreaching evils it is not a sign or weakness or timidity to weigh carefully the proposed remedies and reforms some changes are more necessary than others some may be easy to achieve others may seem impossible at a given time it is the mark of wisdom rather than of weakness to study problems fully and to form plans carefully prudence will indeed guard against the rashness which may endanger solid accomplishmentbut prudence must never serve as an excuse for inaction or unnecessary gradualism or as a reason for not holding a straight steady course toward our goal of full justice    
uncle tom abroad
by julian mayfield
difficult to recognize in africa than he is at home i refer here to the north american genus of the specieshomo tomo americanus this type of tom is u often a technician of some sort in africa on a two or three year contract on the payroll of the u s government or a private firm frequently he is a scholar or a writer who is merely passing through on a lecture or a study tour sponsored by the state department or one of the many wealthy foundations at home you can easily identify the average tom by the way he relates to the white world whether a day laborer college president clerk or scientist he has been convinced by the enormity and seeming indomitability of white power that he and his kind are indeed inferior beings prudence and common sense dictate to him that he should do everything he can to remain on good terms with the master race toms philosophy is dont rock the boat but to isolate the genus here in africa requires keen perception when he alights at the airport tom becomes first and foremost an american abroad with all that that implies he carries himself with a confidence unknown to him at home and he is always on important business he wishes to see the president or the prime minister immediately if he has traveled much he is on a first name basis with all the african leaders i told kwame that i thought he should   jomo met me at the airport and we had a drink together   julius asked me for my advice about   how can one help but be impressed another thing that makes it difficult to identify homo tomo americanus in africa is that here he is always a radical back home you could probably not get his signature for a petition defending the right of women to have babies but  once on african soil he becomes a vociferous advocate of socialism not even lowering his voice or looking over his shoulder one also detects in tom a vein of militancy he never displayed at home to listen to him talk at a party or over dinner one imagines that tom would if he had his way singlehandedly set to rout all the white settlers and drench the continent in their blood if someone is unkind enough to point out to tom that this is strange talk coming from someone who works for the u s embassy which means they must be certain that he is safe or that his tour is being financed by white foundation money tom laughs without the least hint of embarrassment he looks at you with pity and amusement in his eyes as if you are out of touch with what is going on back home among the really hep negroes of his group yes he says it is true that he is on their payroll but he is not with them he knows what those white soandsos are trying to do in africa and that they are trying to use him tom because of his black skin butand here tom usually winks at youhe is smarter than all of them the state department the u s intelligence services the foundations the african study groups etc tom actually believes or at least he wants you to believethat he is taking their money while at the same time he is helping to promote the african revolution but there is one certain way of identifying homo tomo americanus in africa he never does or says anything that might annoy the local u s embassy thus however militant he may sound in private he can never publicly give a straight answer to a simple question about american racialism at one of toms lectures for example if he is asked to comment on the spectacle of mr merediths rather noisy enrollment at ole miss tom replies yes it was shameful but the important thing is that meredith got in thats progress but he is asked why didnt president kennedy use the occasion to teach the morality of human equality to the nation instead of merely pleading with the white students to obey the law well you see says ambassador tom who values his passport highly who likes the idea of being an international traveler and who knows that there is always in the audience an agent from the local embassy recording everything he says mr kennedy has many problems and let me say right now that i think this administration is doing everything it can to eliminate discrimination    poor tom for all of his apparent sophistication he lacks sensitivity he returns home now an expert on africa to write his articles and give lectures unaware that he has been the object of derision and contempt for most informed africans have no illusions about american racial problems even more regrettable is the fact that while traveling through this continent of revolt where millions of people are crawling stumbling and pushing forward toward a better life tom did not draw the obvious conclusion the conclusion that thousands of young black americans are reaching every day that the only way to make progress in a situation of oppression is to rock the boat and to rock it with such violence that either it sinks or it becomes a decent place in which to live  
and his world of
a painter walter sanford has evolved through a periods marked by the unique energy and enthusiasm that the man brings to his work and to his life currently he is involved in  what he terms a return to realism and the canvases being turned out in his chicago studio have the boldness and vigor associated with the great mexican painters david siqueiros and diego rivera the influence is at least partly a reflection of sanfords mexican period a time of his life he regards as having been both especially happy and productive most people who know sanford think of him as being quite a character and even the artist labels himself something of a clown but then he goes on to explain you can escape a lot of hardship by clowninglike bessie smith used to sing i laugh to keep from crying  in any event sanford possesses an outlook and attitude as bold as his painting style and as winning it is instructive to talk to him and exciting to watch him work my art is as rough as funky jazz he says it reflects the tempo the beat of the times currently sanford is working on a series of portraits of real and imaginary figures with such titles as the politician the philosopher and the policeman they are notas one glance will indicate merely portraits but portraitsindepth baring the subjects souls in a whimsical moment sanford lured casey jones chicagos famed chicken man who prowls the city with a rooster that does everything but talk into the studio to pose casey claims to be  among other things and capturing this innerman on canvas would challenge a michelangelo a native of chicago sanford grew up on the south side a far more romantic place then than it is today in grade school he came under the influence of a miss ryan who had him paint a landscape when he was nine the carter school teacher became his first booster sanford whose wife susan is a teacher says that teachers the philosopher is one of a series of sociological paintings on which sanford is working currently have always strongly influenced his life sanfords formal education ended with high school and his rather scanty formal art education included a year of three evenings a week at chicagos art institute and later a year under famed john carroll at detroits arts and crafts until  the artists style was generally expressionistic then caught under the spell of picassos cubism he switched to abstractexpressionism he worked in this style primarily for some  years during his sojourn in detroit las vegas mexico and france the return to realism was a step taken early in  a year after he had established a new studio in the heart of chicagos near south side across the street from the prairie shoreslake meadows urban housing complex sanford crosses town from his home to his studio daily like any man with a job of work to do disdaining artistic affections he receives friends and customers all day entertains them while he works does all the visiting affect his mood and concentrationi am no beatnik artist sanford laughs i am a painter painting is my life and i can do it anywhere at  if i have breath  will be painting and there is no reason to doubt that he will sjn sjvnraisai by aral he is known as sanford when he was  he sold his first painting this lucky event formed his future right then and there he made up his mind to become an artist and to be known as sanford his wife and close friends find even sanford too long and call him san the first halfcentury of his life proves that his early decision was correct today he who has no first name he who uses no middle name has indeed succeeded as sanford the artist sanford the american considers himself a world citizen he has lived and worked in many spots on the globeeurope mexico and all over the united states now after a   «  year absence he has settled in his native chicago  sanfords work proves that he grew with the age undoubtedly his creative talents and masterful techniques have directed him toward the expression of a unique style that is why it is not possible to press him into any specific school or pattern or ism to call sanford an expressionist or an unrealist or a surrealist is both right and wrong he is a mixture of all the established isms like his favorite painter picasso sanford can be judged only by his different periodseach of which reveals the influence of the physical and psychological landscape in which he lived and created take the las vegas nevada period for instance see how the sun the sand the cacti and the coloring of the mountains but certainly the bizarre shapes of deadwood have been transposed thanks to the artists genius blend into the color rhythm of his paintings this period seems to have been the most formative in the development of the artists style sanford must feel this way himself for only a single picture from this period is in his studio all the others are in his home and have never been offered for sale does this mean then that the true sanford is the one of the nevada desert periodit cannot be because there also is his taxco mexico period who ever has set foot on this hidden jewel of mexican beauty will never forget sanfords color symphony from the taxco period this is mexico old mexico and her people abstracted to the essentialsseen with the eyes of a great artist expressed in graphic forms keen composition and bright colors the question arises is this artist a painter specializing in oilsso rash a conclusion could not be more wrong sanfords creativeness is not limited to oils or to landscapes stilllifes or portraits there is sanford the master with the pencil who with a few lines records daily life there is sanford the satyr who with sharp mind and even sharper pen and india ink nails down some hypocritical conceit there is even the master of the linoleumcut and of the woodcut an almost forgotten art only recently did sanford carve his own image into tough oak there is even sanford the sculptor this artist is at ease and at home in so many fields of artistic expression artistic media and techniques that it is impossible to put the finger on the one true sanford    yet having been privileged to watch the gradual development of one of his latest works from the conception in red into a finished masterpiece in blue let me talk for a moment about an oil study for which the artist selected the  name the philosopher this painting reveals the maturity of a man who reaches beyond the stage of being a graphic artist painted without a model sanfordhimself a member of a minority group has created the head of a member of another minority group the image of a jewish dreamer who speaks with his divine master sanford has created a face that smiles as only those continued on page  
the wasted reservoir
by hobart taylor jr
t was one hundred years ago that abraham lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation this move essentially a wartime necessity represented one of the most unusual and daring steps taken in history people who had been regarded as chattelcommodities to be bought or sold on the open market like cotton molasses or rum were suddenly granted their freedom without preparation without adequate advance planning and without the agreement of that section of our country in which the most slaves were owned it was a revolutionary stroke which shook the foundations of our society it created problems both north and south it undoubtedly aided the union forces both in the united states and in americas relations with other nationswhich in the period when the british government had some disposition to intervene in the conflict was a crucial point furthermore it was a move that was morally right and it is a sad commentary that it took a war to place into effect an overriding moral principle the historical accounts differ as to how the slaves themselves greeted the emancipation proclamation the observers then on the scene were so caught up in the frenzied emotions of the bitterest war in our history that few of the contemporary accounts are reliable the romantic concept that the slaves by and large were happy people wellfed and pampered and did not want to leave old massa are obviously arrant nonsense the concept that the newfound freedom went to their heads and they became drunk with power is widespread but has been disputed by eminent historians no doubt the first reaction was one of great joy and an exultant mood of deliverance but the joy and the mood of deliverance must have faded quickly when the realization sank in that what the slaves had been granted was not freedomexcept in a legal sensebut the opportunity to march on the road to freedom if americans have learned anything in the last hundred years it is that the emancipation proclamation did not make men free what it really did was to remove some of the barriers that prevented men from striving to be free this point became apparent quickly when the negro tried to fit himself into the economic life of our country under a structure in which the base of all southern societyslaveryhad been removed he had no idea of what he was supposed to do or how he was supposed to do it he had no concept of wages or of the labormanagement relationship a few exceptional negroes had somehow managedeven before emancipationto establish themselves as successful businessmen but these  ¦ were definitely exceptions and managerial skill was virtually missing from the negro community in some parts of the south slaves had been highly trained as skilled mechanics and semitechnicians but the great bulk were field handsmen and women who had nothing to offer but their ability to pick cotton and tobacco and harvest rice all the former slaves knew was that they were free and that there was a vague idea circulating that each family was entitled to  acres and a mule the  acres and a mule concept has frequently been cited as one of the most ridiculous proposals in our history we forget that at least it represented a programabout the only program that anyone had and if some effort had been made to put it into effect at least the former slaves would have had an economic base which would have permitted participation in our society lacking such a base there was little they could do other than to go on working for old massathis time on the basis of a wage relationship which they did not understand and without old massa being put to the inconvenience of investing capital in them the history of the pursuit of freedom over the last hundred years is in my view largely the narrative of efforts to find the necessary base as a general rule the question of freedom is discussed in dramatic terms such as the right to vote the right to equal justice under the law the right to education the right to free speech and the right to worship as we choose i agree that these are essentials of freedom but i do not think that any of these essentials can be maintained and preserved unless men and women have not only legal guarantees of their rights but the knowledge to take advantage of them and the independent economic position from which they can be exercised without those two essentials rights will exist only on paper we have not really done anything for people if we tell them that they have the right to compete for a  a year job when they are precluded from receiving the training that qualifies them for that job we are not doing anything for people when we tell them that they have the right of free speech if their livelihood is entirely dependent upon one employer or a small group of employers we do not do anything for people when we tell them that they have equal rights before the law when they are ignorant of the pro cesses of the law or even of the measures by which a professional advocate can be secured these are the conditions under which negroes have labored for the hundred years since the emancipation proclamation to the extent to which these problems have been mastered freedom has become more of a reality and only a demagog will deny that even though we are far from attaining the goal of complete freedom enormous strides have been made in the century that has passed today i believe that we are on the threshold of one of the most enormous leaps forward that has been made in freedom for the negro in our history this possibility has been opened up by two factors which seem upon superficial examination to be entirely unrelated to the issue of freedom for minority groups those factors are the atomic age and the space age our nation is one which has never before known the true meaning of labor shortage there have been times and there have been places where productive workers could not be obtained when they were desperately needed but these situations were only temporary and affected only a small number of people in the past our manpower problems have been a question of a surplusnot a shortage we are still plagued by surpluses among workers on the lower level of skills the man whose knowledge extends to no instrument more sophisticated than a pick or the woman whose knowledge extends to an instrument no more sophisticated than a mop but in the higher levels of skills the shoe is already pinching and unless drastic steps are taken within the next few years the shortages could have a serious effect on our economic posture the great new industries that have sprung up around atomic energy electronics and the exploration of outer space gobble up trained minds like locusts attacking a wheat field in the huge space installations of the west coast thoughtful and sober men are already discussing the possibility of a time in the foreseeable future when the u s will have to ration brainpower and establish priorities to determine which scientists go to which projects there simply are not enough physicists chemists metallurgists mathematicians engineers and biologists to go around government administrators complain bitterly that young scientists upon whom they lean heavily are snatched up by private industry on the basis of salaries that the government can never match obviously we must find new sources to teachnew people who can be trained in the complex and highly sophisticated techniques that are required to maintain modern industry we can of course squeeze more scientists out of our present student populationbut not many more to find trained minds in the quantities that we need we are going to have to go to a reservoir which now is scarcely touchedthe  million americans who are of negro descent i do not want to present this in any oversimplified form we do not have before us a quick and easy path to the millenium we are not going to have overnight the spectacle of laboratories suddenly being staffed with negro scientists we must be frank about it and admit to ourselves candidly that the negro scientists do not exist in such quantities the doors of opportunity are wide open but the negroes who would walk through these doors simply are not prepared to take advantage of this opportunity it will be necessary for us to break a pattern that has been building up for a century and which has become so rigid it can be shattered only by a major effort from negro leaders themselves traditionally the educated negro is a teacher a preacher or a dentist some become lawyers and a few become doctors and of course a number become undertakers or insurance executives it is not surprising that this is the pattern in these professions a negro can make a living out of his fellow negroes without ever touching white society at all he need not fear failure solely because of the color of his skin or his ancestry if he has the ability his success is assured but venturing outside of those professions leads him into a risky world where he must take his chances on attaining success on the basis of the whole societywhite and black for most of the hundred years that have gone by the sciences which now offer such golden opportunities have presented the negro with nothing but the prospect of failure why should a man or woman study physics or chemistry or mathematics when the only conceivable outcome will be a job in a mental capacity so our problem is a double one first we must convince our young people that the old patterns no longer prevail and that an education effort will yield rewards second we must work to see that that education is available and that the colleges which are attended by most negroes do have the necessary facilities that will train them in the skills and the professions of the present and the future my job as executive vice chairman of the equal employment opportunity committee has been enormously complicated by the lack of realistic training for negroes it is difficult enough to combat discrimination that is based upon bigotry or upon outmoded patterns of employment it is much more difficult to attack employment discrimination at its source not denial of the right to a job but denial of the right to train for a job when an industry does not em ploy negroes or other minority groups in certain skills the minority groups quickly lose interest in training therefore when the doors of opportunity are opened nobody is available to walk through them time after time i am told by leaders of large corporations that they are perfectly willing to employ negroesif they can find them in some instances this may well be a mere alibi but i believe that most of them are telling the truth industry needs brains and does not care about the color of those brains industry needs skills and does not care about the ancestry of the people possessing those skills but this process is not going to happen automatically it is going to take thought and care and planning and hard work on the part of negroes themselves i would hope that the organizations in the u s that represent negroes would devote themselves to this problem i would like to see our educators our leaders our businessmen come together to plan and to work to change the patterns of negro education and of the negro economy we are past the point where the negro economy can or should live apart from the white economy we are past the point where the only road to success for a negro is by making a living out of his fellow negroes    
the negro writer in america
introductory remarks
one of the things about being an artist is that you are produced by a people because they need you but the people who produce you do not want you this is not a complaint this is simply a statement of fact i suppose that the reason for this has to be something really bad and very mysterious that is that in the same way a human being  a single human being    wants to know who he is and wants to become himself or herself wants to live and read his or her proper name one day as it is    and at the same time wishes to be safe and therefore accepts and adopts all kinds of disguises and begins to believe all kinds of lies in order to be safe  in this safety this mystical or unreal safety he begins to perish this war is in everybody americans want to believe a great many things about themselves which are not true negroes want to believe a great many things about themselves which are not true too part of the dilemma i think of being an american negro is that the negro has been forced for a long long time in many many waysnot only physicallyto mantle himself on a society which always has been essentially incoherent that is to say one is mantling himself on someone who does not know who he is this means then that the imitatorand for the sake of argument you may say that all negroes in this country are imitatorsfinds himself in a very strange confusion and if the writer me jimmy baldwin in this particular case is trying to find out where the truth iswhere i begin and where society stopsto try to tell the truth about my mother or my brother or the porter or the negro bank president and try to find out how this relates to the american myth how it relates to the situation of young people in this countryblack and whitewho are lost in despair and bewildered looking for standards which dont seem to be present in the republic    then you have a fantastic kind of confusion and the role of a writer in this country now i think is to begin to excavate almost for the first time the real history of this country    not the history that one would like to believe about the founding fathers or the nobility of an abraham lincoln but to try to find out what really happened here    what really got us where we are davis i am for better or worst a writer i became an actor not by accident but because i was advised by my professor in philosophy dr alain locke to become a writer when he found that i wanted to write plays and i had come from a little town in georgia called waycross and had never seen a theater he was interested to know how i was going to do it i hadnt given any thought to that part of it so his suggestion was to go become a part of the theater build sets sell tickets learn to act learn everything you can about the theater and eventually you will know what it is you are writing about and for whom you are writing in the terms of actors etc and because of his advice i find myself today from time to time having my long stretches of unemployment interrupted by a job my attitudes toward life have been formed in many places and over long stretches of time and im happy to say that some of the most constructive and generative of those formative people and ideas came from howard university from sterling brown from dr eugene holmes from many others my attitude toward life and toward art and toward writing and toward acting and toward my three children and all the other children in the world is primarily the same i can illustrate it briefly by quoting you a short poem of langston hughes which goes as follows my old mule got a grin on his face he been a mule so long he forgot about his race now im like that old mule black and dont give a damn you got to take me like i am you might think that this is a flippant approach to life and yet its not i have occasion to visit many of the public schools in new york city and in my own community because they are bemused by the idea that im a personage of some importance because i work on the stage    and im too modest to disabuse them so when they send for me i go and i regret to inform you at this late date that i have yet to go into a public school in new york city where there was a negro principal i do not mean that the faculties of these schools are themselves vicious people i do not mean that they are themselves antinegro as a matter of fact they send for me and for my wife and for any other performer to prove to the negro child that there is somebody who in spite of his blackness represents a plus factor on the world scene but i submit that the morale of a small child is too delicate and too important an instrument to have this treatment administered adventitiously it has to be done deliberately i think that all public schools should be staffed by teachers of all races of all faiths of all creeds of all persuasions all kind of people so that a child not only sees himself reflected in the echelons of power but he also sees the world as it really is i think that the time has come when we in this country particularly the black man must hang his harp on the willow and refuse to play it unless he can give the truth about himself his people and the society in which we live killens i as a negro writer negro artist negro teacher negro worker ask america to listen to me i am your conscience get right with me and you will truly be beautiful before the world you will be the land you should have been but never have been yet a famous british writer once said many years ago that the important thing about a writer about an artist is out of how deep a life he speaks generally and specifically speaking what is my frame of reference simply stated i am a member of the human race male sex american more specifically i am john killens im a black man who was a black boy once who grew up in a georgia town who lived and cried and hated and fought and sang and laughed at being negro  a boy who could not grow into manhood with the fullest implication of the word manhood being a dangerous pursuit in georgia or in mississippi as every freedom rider knows and every sitin student knows one of the problems i am faced with is that publishers want me to write about everything else but the negro publishers and producers from hollywood to madison avenue have said to me why do you always want to write about negroes why dont you just write about people negroes are the only people i know who are set apart because of who they are and at the same time told to forget it no one has demanded that tolstoy or certain other writers be so unspecific in their writings why this pressure on this writer to deny his roots to write about anything else but i think it is because the essence of the negro writers material is critical from the essence of his own being which is a criticism of society but i think that if america is going to get healthy it must listen to this criticism we may be the doctor america needs i write about the negro because this is my frame of reference my lifes experience but i also think that the most dynamic personality the most dramatic image in america today is the negro he is the protagonist personified by james meredith struggling with all his might his brain his great soul and his muscles to bring america out of the backwardness of white supremacy into the epoch of the colored people we live in an epoch where the disinherited for the first time in hundreds of years are in the fore england used to boast that the sun never set on the united kingdom look at the map the way it was  years ago and youll see where the sun is setting now this poem by langston hughes sums up why i must write what i write youve taken my blues and gone you sing them on broadway you sing them in the hollywood bowl 
beautiful light and black our dreams
by woodie king jr
world is all aglow today and the day itself is beautiful the sun is shining across the street in the park young men and women are laughing and playing in the warm sun now and then pigeons flutter birds glide in and sing gay songs both birds and pigeons are drinking from the beautiful fountains here and there in the warm sun people are reading their free press today she as the sun will return after her long absence he is in the greek restaurant across from the park waiting and dreaming everyone is so full of dreams in the light and in the dark he is remembering her saying and he is thinking of her in light high above the city in a beautiful glass office smiling gleefully he is thinking that on that eleventh floor of that city building how full of dreams she really is aglow he is thinking this today he is sitting again at the same spot again waiting for her again this year he is fifteen minutes early he is remembering but whats your dream he wanted to ask her that last time when she sat across from him finishing her lunch but he did not not that moment but he wanted to he watched her face like poison exotic fruit dark grey eyes large and always on watch lips full and always in that positionthat position that caused him to know his heart could beat queenly the woman everyone wants the beauty parttime actress secretary six hours a day on the eleventh floor of the new city building only one of that beautiful color joanne watching her finish her lunch with a million dreams in that beautiful head beautiful joanne so serene one of the many women born negro yet are almost white inside and outside the kind of negro woman that has a million dreams of winning beauty contests in canada or being the first negro miss street  railway then being spotted by stanley kramer or somebody anybody the light kind with the features of the caucasian the kind that all men seem to love because they are yet they are not and yet he is man it is not those things that made him care for her  love her for him it goes farther to the time when he first saw her start at the beginning drift backwards travel in slow motion through other winters and summers through time that element that taught her you all the way back to the reason for her being across from you through other tears and laughter the beginning once there was a woman named joanne    go on   i saw her first on the floor of a little theatre reading her lines from a greek tragedy she and an irish fellow whom she loved oh how she loved him played there on that floor in that little white theatre so gay was her laughter so dry was his talking of their trip to palestine talking of blue grass in the beautiful highlands speaking like modjeska saying gee whiz eating pizza laughing getting excited playing wrestling i would watch her often i had to and i wondered why she never looked at me was it time they read their lines and i being dark and invisible to them chose to remain that way for in a world so white and light so strange i felt darkness was forbidden everything about the theatre was white she blended in i did not i could not often i would pass her sometimes she would look upnot at me but up then it changed we would be apart and our eyes would find each other her smiling ceased no words never    never words    never smiles    strange the irish did not look up he looked down always when he was with her he came with indifference and with indifference did i receive him i dreamed one night that she would tell me i did not belong the dream occurred in a snowstorm far away in a place where the snow never seemed to cease its steady fall and i was lost in that snow desert unable to find my way then i saw her    and the falling snow    and she was in a sort of transparent nightgown i asked her if she was cold i wanted to protect her from the cold snow wanted her warm her mouth moved i could hear her voice in an echo resounding away    away  go away   away then the dreamed changed i disappeared and a gigantic black man in chains sweat glistening on his back and face walked slowly towards her singing any day now and his presence made the snow melt made the sun shine made her smile and they danced to songs of leadbelly they danced until she became exhausted until belafonte sang until leadbelly cried i reappeared and the snow returned and the echo away    away    go away    away i went away a long interval of dream filled days and nights the middle once there was a store downtown    slowly    i went in out of the cold white snow a feeling hit me something wonderful more wonderful than life itself in that store something as wonderful as the sudden return of summer after a snowfilled winter my body became fervent i looked for the cause throughout the large store it had to be there it was there i felt it up from the basement all through it until i saw that black and white checked coat far away descending i saw her i looked at her across the store she looked at me no words a smile i found her that winter morning and she saved my summers then we knew we had to know i returned winters and summers of tears and laughter searching the end the end yes life stops sometimes and in those times pain is the only substitute for me there have been many i believe this day will bring another he cares for her and loves her because time caused it time    time that puts beginnings middles and endings to life and love still remembering she turned flashing glances through every face within the huge immaculate restaurant then out the large glass window facing circus park the church the institute of technology north and a city filled with pure white snow look at them she said see how they move they dont know where they are going none of them do they he smiled glad to be with her nodded his head agreeing look at that funny looking couple with the poodle he said finally they both laughed i know they are cold i just know it she said why do they pretend they are warm its freezing out there im hip he said but i cant really think of anything outside youre it today love you she said silence while they looked at each other he wanted to ask her have your dreams changed since the last ones he could notnot now they dont even know one of these days they are going to know who we are ay man he nodded and sipped the hot black coffee we are going to be famous man you and i she said but not as serious as it had been said in happier winters and summers and he thought he knew then yes we are going to be famous he said one of these days he looked at her long whats your dream now joanne labold my dream she said i want to get off the eleventh floor of that damned building i want to be somebody want things want so  much she turned the spoon in the black coffee sometimes i look from my glass and i want to fly down and kiss my fate but there will have to be revolutions before my dream comes true and i cant wait that long look at me my face where do i belong whats my dream whats your dream am i your dream she looked at him long then out the window north will my dream end here joanne he placed his dark hand on her light face gently gently  gently he moved her face opposite his and the black porters in white jackets and black ties gazed the white men in black suits glanced and all the white blonds all white white and starch sat rigid while the knives and forks and spoons tinkled and clashed but he could not hear them he in that moment of black agony heard only the soft white snow falling will my dream end again he repeated himself and the minute she took to answer seemed like an hour we have some time to talk she said he will meet me here in a short while she moved the dark hand away from her face slowly she held it tightly with both hands i wont be seeing you again honest but i love you i love you love you     wont be seeing you again  he knew then he felt it it was there all the turmoil before an erupting emotion all the rushing to the head of the inside of his soul leaving the boiling deep deep far away in the head then changing to hot tearstears that lingered within his hot burning eyes not coming out to be seen never coming out to be seen   tears    tears    and he fought them he noticed her mouthugly nowmoving trying to say something not hearing her not wanting to he looked out the glass into the white white snow north at the cathedral at the bell that would chime then the te deums that for him would never mean glory after them he would be alone again without joanne again viduity again    feeling like a single falling leaf late in the dawn again is this what he had feared her mouth moved i had to see you tell you the seconds of silence seemed like years what can i say hes very nice you will like him anyway you know him hes irish yes i know him he said his voice was a whisper i know she whispered she turned and looked out the glass and that day she remembered she is remembering saturday night sunday morning the end of summer we attended the play long days journey into night how beautiful oneill recreates the feeling of impending doom and i knew there would be a sense of doom in me that night for i had been searching in a strange black world and that world had refused me when i needed it most i wanted to destroy it by becoming a part of the white blending with the white the tragedy of nature he would call it had already told him i loved alexandras that he wanted to take me to paris and ireland and as i remember it was the first time we had ever really talked strange our first conversation had to be about someone white about what that someone wanted to do for me he was hurt because he did not want me to love alexandras did not want me to tell him what white could do for me he tried desperately not to show it i believe i convinced him that that love was a different love not like the feeling for him but i dont think i convinced him anyway he took me to see alexandras in the oneill play he took me to the afterparty he wanted me to be near alexandras it seemed we stayed at the party until four am i glanced at him often watched him moving through the white party dark and invisible to them he never looked at me i talked to alexandras all that time we exhausted ourselves talking about nothing and when we couldnt think of anything else to say we made a date for sunday night i did not tell him he knew we made the date at four am at four am he looked at me across the room through the white crowd sunday morning    mourning  far away  the te deums we talked we kissed for the first time that sunday morning be tween darkness and dawn so gentle gently    gently oh god how wonderful i felt i felt more love than dido must have felt and i fell in loves abyss for the first time everything around me was so strange the darkness and the dawn the sun and the night the coldness and the heat all together at the same time all my life i had been told and i felt that i should go beyond darkness and i could i could change with the seasons but everything about me changed when we caught the darkness and the dawn every little thing became a beautiful phallic symbol made me think of him dark and invisible melting the pretty pretty snow i know she said again you shouldnt have told him to meet you here he said we tried you know that tried he tried to say something else no words came even his lips felt heavy thick he prayed to be what she wanted but he knew he could never be lets talk about something else hows your family she looked at him long her eyes and pretty face expressionless everything about her serene as if she was at rest as if she was    was    inertia i wanted to tell you how it came about i wanted you to understand i understand he said but do you understand dont make me cry she said this had to be  do you understand he said louder bitter the black porters in white jackets and black ties turned the blond people all white and starch showed signs of life and he was slowly dying again all my life she said i have had to protect myself be on guard from what he shouted the pimps hustlers lesbians and others trying to misuse me she paused rubbed his hand continued without looking at him i look unusual go on what else he asked more than anything else it is the negro man i am negro man he said and i never attempted to misuse you how could i know that tell me how could i have known how could i be sure you were real i always guess at what you are feeling never knowing where you are never he looked at a white blond snow white crisp are you listening yes the seconds seemed like hours and man i have been misused she lit a cigarette some tell me of movie contracts and i say well miss labold this is it i spend weeks sometimes months making sure disillusioned some tell me they can make me a star in the ebony fashion fairs or put me on the cover or in the center of jet magazine always it seemed like the break my chance some seem truthful and god knows i try i try to find out but its always the same to them i am an illusion they want that day and night dreamme but they dont want the real me they dont want the me that breathes cries wakes up in the morning goes to the bathroom men dont want me they want an illusion joanne he tried to say something please listen please she continued it made me feel like half a woman not complete in the way i want to be complete long ago iarbas i think i discoveredand it may sound funny as hellmen are spiritually weak they believe in god and nature she smiled you too man you too joanne he said you are trying to get outside your world the irish one is not for you he will never be he cannot be nature and god forbid it dont you see dont you understand they could find nothing to say for a long time just as nature and god forbid snow to fall twelve months of the year summer must return you are my summers joanne and if you are leaving because of disillusions feeling i think you are an illusion you will return like summer so full of dreams she said love you in light and darkness i think maybe yes she said the seconds lingered dont leave me joanne he whispered dont take it away i can never be complete with you bridge people i cannot make your dream come true i am human dont you know you will return again dont you know you cannothe cannottake away what is mine by birth you are mine i know it he knows it you know it    mine    mine    mine    i love you i love you i love you i love you iarbas i love    dont joanne he remembered saying the bell in the church rang onetwothreefour    his heart must have skipped a beat he felt his chest once looked out the glass hearing the bell sounding in his ears feeling his heart hitting his chest feeling his mouth becoming dry still looking out the glass looking for that facelooking searching for that face that would blend with the snow and she flashing glances as if really frightened regaining her composure putting on her lipstick or looking at herself in her small mirror and he still looking out into the snow hearing the bell hoping it would cease then both looking out the glass both seeing alexandras approaching from the far end of the park approaching dressed in a black top coat and sitting there he could not hear chains dragging from afar and he could not hear him singing any day now but he could hear music from the psaltery and the music sounded so beautiful in that glen of blue grass in the highlands far away where he could never be but where she might go and leave him forever and she could dance her dance to the music of the psaltery she could play in the bue grass of the high places as she played on that floor in that little theatre long ago she could stop and listen to the bell the bell the bell onetwothree    the te deums    bongbongbongbongi love youbonglove youbonglovebongyoubong    bong    alexandros approaching with indifference she rose looked at him see you see you alexandros there she smiling up to him    and with indifference did i receive him both leaving he is alone both crossing the snow filled park her checked black and white coats collar turned up he holding her arm going north and she speaking something to alexandros he still sitting in the restaurant watching her ugly back watching the tracks of her black overshoes sink deeper and deeper into the pretty pretty snow watching and hoping hearing her voice see you    see you    wishing he could be what she wanted he turns and looks into the sun filled park at the couples laughing at the birds and pigeons that lounge and linger there at the beautiful water fountains that emit all colors of waterswaters that spring so misty and settle so clear at the cut green grass so green that it appears blue and the feeling he holds at this moment should be a bequeathal to the world it is everymans he sees her she is running towards him calling his name he stands he smiles she waves and watching her he is thinking that winters cannot last forever but he is also thinking that neither can the warm summers there are so many things that nature and god forbid 
the flowering of africas seeds
by e l lasebikan
s a result of the impora v tation of african j slaves into brazil  many years ago and their subsequent emancipation and absorption into brazilian society several seeds of the african way of life were sown into the field of brazilian culture of these seeds some sprang up immediately grew into lovely trees and are bearing fruit today especially in bahia where the majority of the population is of african descent to mention three examples only we have first the candomble the religious cult of african origin which commands a formidable following comprising brazilians and foreigners of all races and classes and which in its regalia and decorations has lent scope for a magnificent display of brazilian taste for art and beauty then we have as a direct offshoot of the candomble african religious songs drumrhythms and dancemovements which have been handed down from one generation to another by oral tradition and are kept alive by constant practice at the religious ceremonies espe daily in bahia and thirdly we have food items of african origin such as acaraje vatapa caruru and so on which are relished by many brazilians irrespective of their race of class there is no doubt that many of the seeds sown did perish without ever sprouting into life but it appears that a number of the seeds have remained latent through the years and are waiting to be helped to germinate the move recently made by the university of bahia in inaugurating a course in yoruba language and culture at its centre of afrooriental studies seems to have produced the immediate effect of quickly germinating some of these dormant seeds in addition it holds the promise of being the means by which many more of the dormant seeds will be brought to life and many more fresh seeds introduced among the seeds that have been helped to grow through the inauguration of the course in yoruba language and culture three may be mentioned namely the use of yoruba as a means of communication the wearing of yoruba dress at social functions and the introduction of ayo the formost of yoruba indoor games already most of the second year yoruba students at the centre take pride in greeting each other in yoruba and in holding conversations in the language to the extent of the vocabulary at their disposal a number of the students have also  secured pen friends in nigeria and carry on correspondence with them in yoruba though not entirely without occasional assistance and there is no doubt that as the students vocabulary increases and their technique improves they will be able to make more and more use of the language yoruba dress was worn in public by brazilians for the first time on the th of october  when the yoruba class staged the play oduduwa ati awon qmo re at the theatre school in the university of bahia on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence of nigeria on that occasion the men turned up in their agbada and fila labankada and the women in their gele and iborun but since then the agbada the gila the gele and the iborun have been worn by bahians several times at social functions on the th of january  the sociedade beneficente sao jorge do engenho velho threw a party at casa branca in honour of the fifteen students from different countries of africa who recently arrived in bahia on scholarships awarded by the government of brazil at that social gathering that sunday afternoon the agbada was conspicuously in evidence and it is significant to note that one of the newlyarrived students was wearing a nigeriansewn agbada and the president of the society sr antonio agnelo pereholes in their respective homes with the seeds they have won the player who succeeds in filling up is the winner and he or she wins by the number of seeds left over in the case of both players succeeding in filling up the game is a draw h the winner of one game plays first in the next after a drawn game either of the two opponents may play first i to know the decisive winner it is customary to play a set of three or even seven games the ayo game has only been introduced into the yoruba classes quite recently arrangements for the construction of the first ayo board was placed in the hands of sr antonio jacintho one of the second year students who got a carpenter to make the board from the dimensions supplied and the picture from the cover of alawiye book iii one of the yoruba books prescribed for the course as we are unable to obtain the real ayo seeds in bahia we are improvising with certain beads with a skyblue colour known as contas de louca they are a little smaller than ayo seeds but they are serving the purpose quite well the ayo game is becoming popular among the yoruba students already a number of opon ayo have been ordered by individual students for their homes jacintho later presented me with a copy of the late manoel querinos book entitled a raca africana and called my attention to the bit on page  of what the author called aiu and was probably the same as the newly introduced game ayo i discovered that it was the following is what manoel quertino wrote about the game nas horas de descanso entretinhamse a jogar o aiu que consistia num pedaco de tabua com doze partes concavas onde colocavam e retiravam os aius pequenos frutos cor de chumbo originarios da africa e de forte consistencia entretinhamse largo tempo nessa distracao and here is a free translation of it in leisure hours they amuse themselves by playing the aiu which consisted of a block of wood with twelve hollowed parts where they place and remove the aius small fruits of the colour of lead which originated from africa and are of hard structure they amuse themselves for a long time with this pastime later investigation revealed that the ayo game was indeed known in bahia many years ago but that it has now disappeared why a game so popular among the yorubas and by nature so captivating should have died out completely in bahia i still have not been able to find out the ayo game is perhaps one of the seeds of the african way of life which sprang up immediately but later perished without growing to maturity to try and discover why and how it perished might constitute a useful piece of investigation but the more important thing is that a fresh seed of the ayo the foremost of yoruba indoor games has now been sown at the centre of afrooriental studies in the university of bahia brazilian culture appears to me as a culture of cultures constantly being further enriched by the development of the various aspects of the original cultures of the ethnic groups that go to make the brazilian nation the systematic study of african languages and cultures has only just started and is bound to increase and develop as time goes on when therefore in the process of time more of the dormant seeds of the african way of life have been awakened and many more fresh seeds have been sown what an array of lovely trees will be added to the field of brazilian culture what a further enrichment will be made of a culture of cultures  
is the white southener really inferior
by gerald walker
ome of my best friends are white southerners and i regret f beyond words the necessity for raising questions which may sorely vex them yet the white southerner problem will never be solved if we continue to gloss over certain hard facts out of a shortsighted desire to spare a minority groups feelings theyas well as we white northernerswill be far better off if at last these troublesome matters are discussed openly personally i feel only the greatest affection and respect for the white southerner in his place the trouble is however that lately the white southerner has shown all too little awareness of what and where his proper place is i refer of course to his precipitous turning away from his traditional agrarian way of life and his rather pushy efforts in recent years to attract new industry below the masondixon line now generally speaking it is certainly commendable for a backward region to try to raise itself but i must add in all candor that the impatient not to say aggressive manner in which a handful of white southerner agitators has gone about this task has sown the seeds of suspicion and competition between our two regions where previously there had been only harmony and understanding indeed interregional relations have deteriorated badly moreover my concern goes far beyond the somewhat narrow consideration that a number of white northerners have already lost their jobs as a result of their factories closing and moving south rather it seems to me that the real point is that perhaps it is time for the rest of the country to ask is the white southerner really ready for progress is he trying to come too far too fast after all the white southerner is but one hundred years removed from practicing slavery and while admittedly he had made rapid strides and come a long way since losing the civil war to an adversary battleproved to be his superior has he yet earned the right of full participation in the industrialized mainstream of contemporary american life would it not be better for all concerned for the white northerner to continue his stewardship of the south until such a time as there was not a shred of a doubt of the white southerners capacity to fend for himself for the plain fact of the matter is that there are vast areas of difference between the white southerner and the white northerner these differencesin morality in criminality in temperament in mentality in ambition and generally in the ability to adapt to the ways of western civilizationfirst became apparent to me when i was a carpetbagging freshman at the university of georgia in  at that time though i was still naive and inexperienced enough unquestioningly to accept the prevailing theory that regional differences stemmed from socioeconomic conditions since then as a result of a number of return trips to the south while researching magazine articles i have gotten to know the white southerner well i have lived in close proximity to these people for extended periods visited their homes broken bread with them observed their customs and gone to their social functions making due allowance for the white southerners good qualitieshumor hospitality charm chattinessi soon came to realize that he was in fact a totally different and essentially inferior breed when measured against his neighbor the white northerner more than that it also became obvious that the socioeconomic conditions which i had at first mistaken for determining factors were merely symptoms of some deeprooted congenital flaw in the white southerners fundamental nature these firsthand observations on my part have lately been substantiated by the impartial findings of modern science as set forth most effectively by carleton putnam in his eyeopening work race and reason mr putnam whose extensive background as an airlines executive led him directly into becoming a noted amateur authority in the fields of anthropology biology psychology and anatomy is primarily concerned with demonstrating the innate hereditary factors which account for the observable inferiority of the average negro to the average white some indication of the brilliance with which he succeeded may be gathered from the wide circulationover  copies soldand enthusiastic reception that his book has enjoyed in southern states since its publication in  for example mississippi governor ross barnett proclaimed october   as race and reason day capped by a aplate dinner in putnams honor and the louisiana state legislature passed a resolution that same year ordering high schools throughout the state to assign the book for study to selected mature students needless to say valid scientific principles and procedures are applicable to more than one set of data and circumstances thus a yardstick may be used to measure the length of an eel as well as a snake and so it is only further proof of the ingeniousness and usefulness of the anthropological and cultural criteria developed by mr putnam and his school if i now employ them in a painstaking scientific comparison of the average white southerner and the average white northerner as  mr putnam and similarly objective researchers might say let the chips fall where they may it is only the truth that we are after this specialized field is still too new for there to have been much extensive research yet on the comparative skull sizes and brain weights of white southerners as opposed to white northerners however there has been some very good work done in connection with the well known innate defect in the white southerners jawbone and larynx by which he is prevented from speaking the english language properly according to professor w a emerson research director of the nonprofit curtis foundations center for higher learning and himself a white southerner the ws jawbone averages  centimeters more in length than that of the typical wn specimen other investigators  building upon this discovery have found that this additional length narrows the throat cavity signally constricting the larynx and causing the congenital speech abnormality popularly known as a southern  accent in addition particularly in the case of ws females and political figures it seems to produce the peculiar effect of preventing the speaker from cutting off the flow of words until at least the better part of an hour has passed i needless to say no individual ws can be held personally accountable for the current state of his particular set of genes which is the result of several centuries of inbreeding of regional stock that was poor to begin i with but let us lay aside any inference of blame the point is simply that genetic facts are genetic facts and they must be taken into consideration when discussing the ramifications of inherent regional differences along these lines it is of the highest significance that not one of americas first five astronauts was a ws shepard was bom in new hampshire grissom in indiana glenn in ohio camenter in colo    rado and schirra in new jersey in short when the national aeronautics and space administration was i given every resource to comb this country for the cream of american manhood the ws was deliberately bypassed in favor of the wn said  an air force general at the time project mercury began what were looking for is a group of ordinary supermen nasa either did not look in dixie or if it did none were found but the ws has never been much of a supermannot even an ordinary one as far back as  the hon j h lumpkin of georgia referred to our poor degraded halffed halfclothed and ignorant population without sabbath schools or any other kind of instruction mental or moral or without any just appreciation of character    frederick law olmstead the distinguished thcentury wn landscape architect traveled throughout the entire old south and in  in the cotton kingdom he reported on his interviews with  ws men in their own homes and across their own tables    the proportion of the free white men olmstead wrote who live as well in any respect as our working classes in the north on an average is small and the citizens of the cotton states as a whole are poor they work little and that little badly they earn little they sell little they buy little and they have littlevery littleof the common comforts and consolations of civilized life their destitution is not material only it is intellectual and it is moral i know not what virtues they have that rude men everywhere have not but those which are commonly attributed to them i am sure that they lack they are not generous or hospitable and to be plain i must say that their talk is not the talk of even courageous men elsewhere they boast and lack selfrestraint yet when not excited are habitually reserved and guarded in expressions of opinion very much like cowardly men elsewhere doubtless the ws will attempt to discount olmsteads careful observations as the biased judgment of a yankee but it is impossible to explain away a strikingly similar description penned by hinton rowan helper a ws born in north carolina in  in his book the impending crisis poverty ignorance and superstitionmind you this is helper talking about his fellowwssare the three leading characteristics of the nonslaveholding white of the south many of them grow up to the age of maturity and pass through life without ever owning as much as five dollars at any one time thousands of them die at an advanced age as ignorant of the common alphabet as if it had never been invented all are more or less impressed with a belief in witches ghosts and supernatural signs few are exempt from habits of sensuality and intemperance none have anything like adequate ideas of the duties which they owe either to their god to themselves or to their fellowmen pitiable indeed in the fullest sense of the term is their condition some might object that this is hardly a balanced portrait of ws society or representative ws types what about they might interject the southern aristocrat arent we distorting things by not including him since he embodies the finest flowering of dixies plantation civilization here then is what historian henry adams had to say in his autobiographical the education of henry adams about rooney lee son of robert e lee and the other young southern bourbons whom he knew at harvard from  to  tall largely built handsome genial noted adams with liberal virginia openness toward all he liked he roony lee had also the virginian habit of command    for a year at least    was the most popular and prominent man in his class but then seemed slowly to drop into the background the habit of command was not enough and the virginian had little else he was simple beyond analysis so simple that even the simple new england student could not realize him no one knew enough to know how ignorant he was how childlike how helpless    as an animal the southerner seemed to have every advantage but even as an animal he steadily lost ground    strictly the southerner had no mind he had temperament he was not a scholar he had no intellectual training he could not analyze an idea and he could not even conceive of admitting two    so much for the old south what of the newthe industrialized south prematurely announced in  by atlanta newspaper editor henry w grady industrialization never fully took but it went far enough for the incisive ws historian w j cash to include a memorable wordpicture in the mind of the south according to cash by  the cottonmill worker was a pretty distinct physical type in the south a type in some respects perhaps inferior to even that of the old poor white which in general had been his to begin with a deadwhite skin a sunken chest and stooping shoulders were the earmarks of the breed chinless faces microcephalic foreheads rabbit teeth goggling deadfish eyes rickety limbs and stunted bodies aboundedover and beyond the limit of their prevalence in the countryside the women were characteristically stringyhaired and limp of breast at twenty and shrunken hags at thirty or forty and the incidence of tuberculosis of insanity and epilepsy and above all of pellagra the curious vitamindeficiency disease which is nearly peculiar to the south was increasing this is not the snopeshaunted fiction of a faulkner pursued by a vision of rapacious termitelike subhumans taking over the south these are the words of a ws historian a man who deals in facts not horrific fables the same set of facts underlies erskine caldwells recollection of the countryside in his native georgia around  within a few miles from town he remembered families on tenant farms were huddled around fireplaces in drafty hovels most of them were despondent some were hungry as usual others were ill and without medical attention food and clothing were scarce and in some instances nonexistent jobs were rarely to be found  i could not become accustomed to the sight of childrens stomachs bloated from hunger and seeing the ill and aged too weak to walk to the fields to search for something to eat thomas wolfe another literary ws has testified to his fellows hostile and murderous intrenchment against all new life    their cheap mythology their legend of the charm of their manners the aristocratic culture of their lives the quaint sweetness of their drawl perhaps most disturbing to wolfe was the familiar rationalizing and selfdefense of southern fear and southern failure  its inability to meet or to adjust itself to the conditions strifes and ardors of a modem life its old sick appomattoxlike retreat into the shades of folly and delusion    of florid legend and defensive casuitry   and finally wolfe remarks of his autobiographical character george webber he was a southerner and he knew that there was something wounded in the south he knew that there was something twisted dark and full of pain which southerners have known all their livessomething rooted in their souls beyond all contradiction what is this something wolfe refers to it is that basic flaw of character which made the south the only section of the new young america to indulge on a large scale in the savage practice of slavery the first slaves were brought to virginia in  exactly  years later alexis de tocqueville sent to the united states by the french government noted how slavery had affected the ws in the intervening time in democracy in america de tocqueville pointed out that to begin with the settlers of the american colonies all belonged to the same european race had the same habits the same civilization the same laws and their shades of difference were extremely slight having begun on an equal footing the scales of character and affluence soon tilted sharply in favor of the nonslaveholding wn to the ws   labor is confounded with the idea of slavery while to the wn it is identified with that of prosperity and improvement on the one side it is degraded on the other it is honored    thus the men whose task it is to cultivate the rich soil of kentucky are ignorant and apathetic while those who are active and enlightened either do nothing or pass over into ohio where they may work without shame    thus slavery prevents the whites not only from becoming opulent but even from desiring to become so    this same influence equally extends to their manners  in the south there are no families so poor as not to have slaves the citizen of the southern states becomes a sort of domestic dictator from infancy    his education tends then to give him the character of a haughty and hasty man irascible violent ardent in his desires impatient of obstacles but easily discouraged if he cannot succeed upon his first attempt    wss have neither traditions family feelings nor the force of example to check their excesses the authority of the laws is feeble among them that of morality is still weaker the settlers who are constantly peopling the valley of the mississippi are then in every respect inferior to the americans who inhabit the older parts of the union today three and a half centuries and a dozen generations after the inception of slaverys ill effects upon the ws it is small wonder that the biological law of natural selection should have worked some significant genetic changes the net result being that many of the above ws traits are today hereditary of course it may be objected that what we have just presented are but isolated impressions albeit perceptive ones based on careful observation and investigation what is needed it might be said is largescale objective uptodate evidence concerning the physical and mental makeup of the ws for precisely this sort of data let us now examine some highly revealing selective service statistics from world wars i and ii in  army psychologists devised what they called the beta intelligence test to which inductees were subjected a leading segregationist intellectual spokesman richmond news leader editor james jackson kilpatrick cited a sampling of the beta test results in his recent book the southern case for school segregation even the figures selected by him show the ws running a poor second to the wn as can be seen from the following white southerners and white northerners army intelligence tests  ws wn state median score state median score mississippi  pennsylvania  kentucky  new york  arkansas  illinois  georgia  ohio  oddly enough although mr kilpatrick used a similar differential between white southerners and negro southerners as the basis for arguing the latters inferiority and for justifying segregation he did not feel logically impelled to draw the same conclusions about the ws in relation to the wn this is a contemporary example of the wss inability to conceive of admitting two ideas at once first pointed out by henry adams a century ago in the three and a half decades between world wars i and ii the wsthanks to prodigious efforts by the federal government and private foundationsexperienced notable increases in educational cultural economic health and social opportunities surely it might be supposed these gains would have been reflected in some significant improvement in his showing when tested for military service no such improvement can be discerned during world war ii the selective service system divided the country into four regions region i the north region ii the midwest region iii the far west and region iv the south for present purposes let us limit our comparisons to region i consisting of maine new hampshire vermont massachusetts connecticut rhode island maryland delaware pennsylvania new jersey new york and region iv arkansas oklahoma texas florida virginia north carolina south carolina kentucky georgia tennessee alabama mississippi louisiana general service acceptance rates and disqualification rates per  white registrants from november  to december  were region i the north  accepted for general service  disqualified region iv the south  accepted for general service  disqualified the difference between the sum of acceptances and rejections and the total of  is accounted for by the men admitted for limited service during the above period the acceptance rate of ws males was not only lower than that of wn males of region i but was lower than of wn males in the other two regions as well region ii the midwest  accepted  disqualified region iii the far west accepted  disqualified nor did the relative discrepancy between acceptance and rejection rates for wns and wss change later in the war from january  to december  the figures were region i the north  accepted  disqualified region iv the south  accepted  disqualified illuminating also are the statistics showing the prevalence of certain specific defects per  white registrants from november  to december   region i the north syphilis gonorrhea and other venereal diseases educational and mental deficiency region iv the south syphilis gonorrhea etc educational and mental deficiency infant mortality rates are another index of living conditions and the populations hardiness in a given region expressed as a rate per

matched only by his moral deficiencies and criminal inclinations reported john gunther in inside u s a the kind of piquant sociological detail known to readers of william faulkner still crops up in the news from day to day while i was in atlanta the papers printed a handsome little story about nine sisters all of whom were prostitutes in the same room lillian smith the author of strange fruit told me in clayton georgia of a recent case in which a baby died the parents left it on the bed to rot they were not rendered helpless by grief they made no effort to bury the body because they simply didnt know any better promiscuity and illegitimacy run  per cent higher among wss than among wns the u s national vital statistics division reports that for   out of every  live ws births took place out of wedlock the comparable figure for wns was a mere  another way of putting this is to state the white illegitimacy rate as a percentage of total white births a set of figures introduced on the floor of the house of representatives on march   by mississippi congressmen john bell williams shows the following ws illegitmate births average  per cent of total ws births but only  per cent for wns in that same speech ws rep williams let slip another set of figures pointing up the higher rate of crime among wss compared with wns the figures revealed that in the  northern states cited by rep williams the rate of wn felony prisoners then in jail came to  per  wn population but in the  southern states he selected the ws rate was  per  in particular crimes of violence are an old southern custom charlotte n c was once known as the murder capital of america writing in  ws historian w j cash said   long before hatred for the black man had begun to play any direct part in the pattern of more than three hundred persons said to have been hanged or burned by mobs in the south between  and  less than ten per cent were negroes the south had become peculiarly the home of lynching cash then goes on to record that   of the grand total of  negroes lynched in the nation from the beginning of  until the close of  only  were lynched outside the former confederate states and of these  were lynched in the border states of maryland kentucky west virginia and missouri themselves more than half southern lynchings aside cash also pointed out that fbi official murder rates showed that    the southern cities were over five times as murderous as those of either the north central area or the far west over six times as those of the middle atlantic country and over eighteen times as those of new england true slum negroes did account for many of these southern murders but since the ws was the dominant majority in the south it cannot escape the responsibilty for having set the moral tone of the region of which the overall murder rate is but a reflection such a condition carries over to this day although the ws constitutes  per cent of the countrys white population he is responsible for an alarmingly disproportionate share of american crime thus the justic departments latest edition of national prisoner statistics indicates that of all prisoners executed under civil authority in the united states  for murder rape armed robbery and kidnaping  per cent were wss still another peculiarly southern crime is the deliberate setting of forest fires folksily called firestrolling by wss the region has onefourth of the nations forest acreage but it is annually the scene of over  per cent of u s forest fires no less than  per cent of southern forest fires during  according to an authoritative estimate were the work of deliberate woods burners in louisiana mississippi and florida the percentage ran to  per cent and since ws firebugs wait for dry ground and a high wind the cause a total of  per cent of our forest acreage loss not only does the ws lawbreaker show disproportionate violence and criminality but there is a similar tendency operating among ws law enforcers this bloodlust is particularly irresistible to ws judges and juries for although the south holds less than onethird of the countrys total population year after year no less than twothirds of american executions take place there illiteracy is still another longstanding ws tradition harry golden 
in an attempt to escape the crime violence and primitive living standards which pervade their native region over  southerners white and negroleft dixie during the s somewhat more than the number of persons who fled east germany during a comparable period unhappily the wsnot to mention his new neighborsfound that he carried these conditions right along with him albert n votaw in the february  harpers described the prickly integration problem the ws presented to a typical northern city at that time there were  ws recent arrivals in chicago settling together in one south side neighborhood they presented the authorities with a number of difficulties a police captain was quoted as saying they are vicious and knifehappy they are involved in  per cent of our arrests in this district observed a municipal court judge   youll never improve the neighborhood until you get rid of them other comments on the transplanted ws during the course of the article   disorderly untamed to urban ways    antisocial to the point of delinquency in the eyes of their neighbors    the poor domestic habits they bring from small backwoods communities    their housekeeping is easy to the point of disorder    children play freely anywhere without any supervision    when it comes to sex training their habitswith respect to such matters as incest and statutory rape are clearly at variance with urban legal requirements and parents fail to appreciate the interest authorities take in their sex life    on the job they are said to lack ambition    considered poor tenants    white southern school children are handicapped    they are too old for their grades and too mature physically for their classmates    prone to disease    they are a disgrace to their race a south side school principal has said that the average i q of his  pupils most of whom are wss is only  moreover only  of them had a rating of above  the chicago sunday tribune summed things up this way the southern hillbilly migrants who have descended like a plague of locusts in the last few years have the lowest standard of living and moral code if any the biggest capacity for liquor and the most savage tactics when drunk which is most of the time obviously the ws isnt the same kind of person as the wn he just isnt accustomed to or perhaps capable of living the same way the rest of us do and we should make allowances for that fact however at the same time we should put some sensible limit on the extent of the wss participation in business national affairs and interregional social contact after all as harry golden has said would you want your sister to marry a governor faubus the ws may very well represent an insoluble problem in any event it is a problem that will take timea great deal of time perhaps centuriesto even approach solving no one denies the economic disparity between ws and wn but this is only a reflection of genetic facts hereditary equality and total massive integration of the ws into the national economy are things that can neither be rushed nor legislated we must maintain perspective and not plunge headlong into a dubious social experiment for the sake of some vague abstract idea of justice our system may not be perfect but it approaches true justice for all more closely than any other ws and wn should each stick to their own kind moving forward separately and harmoniously as in the past the ws should have enough regional and racial pride to want to develop in his own way and at his own natural pace not force himself in when and where he isnt wanted besides geographical separation is a basic law of nature if the good lord had intended wss and wns to work and live in the same way and locale he would not have created a north and a south in the first place most important of all we cannot risk jeopardizing the american way of life for the sake of the impulsive impatient leaders of a minority that would be a perversion of the true meaning of democracy for although it would undoubtedly raise the ws if the standards of interregional intercourse were relaxed to permit him a larger role in the nations affairs it would at the same time inevitably lower the wn what after all has the ws contributed to american civilization it is an extraordinary catalogue hookworm slavery the filibuster hominy grits the ku klux klan pellagra mint juleps lynching the university of mississippi and high treason in seceding from the union sic transit gloria moonshine of the wss failure to produce a real culture and civilization of his own w j cash said leaving mr jefferson aside the whole south produced not only no original philosopher but no derivative one to set beside emerson and thoreau no novelist but poor simms to measure against the northern galaxy headed by hawthorne and melville and cooper no painter but allston to stand in the company of ryder and a dozen yankees no poet deserving the name save poeonly half a southerner true lately there has been a spurt of interest among residents of the menckendubbed sahara of the bozart in novelwriting but this has never been an activity that could serve as a proper index of the practitioners character industry and moral fiber besides according to gore vidal a wn novelist the ws novelist is not really a writer states vidal southerners talk and talk tell and tell    they talk in chronicles they talk in novels emphasis added in other words there is nothing to southern writing but mere gabbiness and the coincidence that some recent flukey change in the structure of a few sets of games has started causing a handful of wss to start putting this gabbiness on paper since there is no artistry involved in idle palaver it is plain that no more cultural credit is due a ws for writing a novel than would be due a monkey typing out gone with the wind by sheer chance it would be patently unfair to leave the impression that all wss are naturally primitive violent criminal shiftless promiscuous uncultured and undistinguished there have been a number perhaps a hundred over the past three and a half centuries who do not fall into those categoriesbut many of these had northern blood among more recent ws notables senator harry flood byrd of virginia and his brother admiral richard byrd have a wn greatgreatgreatgrandmother the father of the late josephus daniels north carolina newspaper editor and statesman was a rhode island ships carpenter zachary taylor twelfth president of the united states had wn ancestry jefferson davis the president of the confederate states was the son of wn and wn blood flowed through the veins of such other stalwarts of the confederacy as major general jeb stuart general james longstreet general john clifford pemberton and john slidell appointed commissioner to france by jefferson davis even daniel boone himself was bom in bucks county pa    it should also be duly noted that the figure of the yankee peddler was a familiar one throughout the south during the eighteenth century as he wended his way across the countryside selling his wares it is not inconceivable that in addition to some calicoes scizzors and clocks he may have left behind him some wn genes here and there these might well have made their presence felt without ever showing up on an official genealogy it only needs to be said that the average rankandfile ws today is well satisfied with things as they are but is being goaded on by a handful of agitators and fomentors into making more demands than the country can safely meet or than wss as a whole could handle in their present stage of development who are these clandestine pressure groups and what are they really after a hint was provided in a new york times dispatch of jan   about the lures offered by the ws in his drive to attract new industry this steppedup economic warfare wrote atlanta correspondent claude sitton    poses a threat to areas in the north and midwest in which rising costs and industrial strife have caused management to grow restless it also has aroused concern in financial circles some securities experts contend that industrial subsidies being offered in both the south and the north are endangering the tax structure and municipal credit and carrying the nation toward state capitalism a south carolina legislative committee has termed these lures somewhat socialistic emphasis added has the kremlin taken over the ws equality movement how sincere is the ws when it can be shown that he is playing directly into the hands of a foreign ideology are we being lulled by a pack of finesounding words into forgetting the wss natural tendencies toward violence and lust these are pressing questions for every wn american to keep in mind during the trying days ahead
