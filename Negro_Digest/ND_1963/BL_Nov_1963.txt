how to stamp out the dope racket
by atty s carter mcmorris
	his writer is a member  nps f of the legal profession  i p and as such has had considerable experience in criminal trials and appeals i am also a member of society and i hope a publicspirited member there are those who would say that there is a conflict between the two positions that a criminal lawyer is necessarily at odds with the best welfare of society in that he uses every device at his command to preserve the freedom of alleged law violators w  including dope pushers however one of the basic tenets of my philosophy is that society has only the criminals it deserves and that the function of the criminal lawyer is to protect from social persecution those unfortunate victims of our collective confusions whom we seek to make the scapegoats for the wrongs of alltoocriminal community much of the income of todays criminal lawyer is derived from defense of people accused of narcotics law violations yet i wish that this source of income were completely eliminated at this point my position as a member of society dominates that of defender of the accused the use of narcotics has such dire individual and social consequences that i fear for our general welfare unless something is done to curb it however in my opinion the proposals and approach of those people albeit wellmeaning who consider jail a panacea for all our social problems will only increase the dope peril this is true because the get tough approach will be no more effective in the case of narcotics than it was in the case of alcohol all too soon we seem to have forgotten the lessons of our prohibition blunder which led to repeal in  short years during which the criminal world ran rampant in its pushing of illegal booze get tough legislation made possible the a capones and lucky lucianos of that era similar legislation in the narcotics field will necessarily result in the same sort of breakdown in fact has already done so to an extent not fully yet appreciated legislative fiat in connection with the narcotics problem like that perennially proposed by the womens christian temperance union for control of the beverage use of alcohol will prove a miserable failure because however desirable it may be theoretically it fails to take into account the realities of human nature in particular the weaknesses of human nature which lead to most of our problems personal or international in the first place the specific weaknesses which are at the root of the narcotics problem are ignorance and greed ignorance of the user who becomes a victim before he realizes the facts of addiction greed of the pusher who will risk anything because of the tremendous profits involved finally greed of the lawenforcement officer who often looks the other way when sufficient bribe is offered by the wellheeled men who run the illicit narcotics business such as the mafia or cosa nostra the get tough policy also fails to take into consideration the fact that detection on a large enough scale to get at the root of the problem is wellnigh impossible no matter how many skilled federal and state narcotics officers are retained at the expense of the taxpayers this is true because of the constitutional ruling that private premises and persons may not be invaded or searched by such officers unless they have a warrant or probable cause case after case has been dismissed against known and proven dope possessors or sellers because their constitutional rights were violated by the arrresting officers narcotics violations being necessarily of a private nature involving no protesting victim is especially susceptible to protection against police trespass of even greater pertinence and effect is a recent decision of the united states supreme court in a case appealed to it by this writer which holds that narcotics addicts must now be m treated not penalized for their condition this decision leaves open to the states at least three approaches to the addict they may simply leave him alone concentrating their efforts solely upon the dealers the real criminals albeit created and preserved by our asinine approach of the past which has failed to recognize the sociomedical as distinguished from criminal nature of addiction secondly the addict may be subjected to forced hospitalization confinement treatment this approach while consistent with the courts edict will have little or no effect on the overall problem because it will reach only those addicts who are caught since very few will voluntarily submit to compulsive treatment this leaves yet a third method which it is the purpose of this writing to explain and advocate and which is commonly known as the free clinic plan of narcotics legalization by legalization we mean not that dope may be supplied or administered by a street peddler corner grocer bartender or even druggist what is meant is that a person who is shown by appropriate tests to be an addict may be given sufficient quantities of the needed drug to make him comfortable unless he voluntarily submits to a cure perhaps under persuasion encouragement and education to the facts of addiction in which case such cure may be attempted in either event the drug may be supplied only by a duly licensed physician and administered under his guidance clinics should be established or enlarged so that the narcotics may be supplied at nominal cost or no cost at all because the prime consideration is to take the profits out of dope pushing it all adds up to a choice of the lesser of two evils in the first place i do not personally see dope use or government supply in free clinics as so much a moral issue as a question of individual and public health i do not think that the use of dope is basically any different from or more immoral than the use of alcohol or cigarettes nicotine itself being a narcotic the only reason why it does not kill off more people being that most of it goes up in smoke as contrasted with the mainline injection of heroin into the veins i do not think that anyone should use narcotics or tobacco or alcohol perhaps but i do not think the use can be stopped by force it is here that ignorance comes in and its counterpart education the only way to prevent the use of harmful substances privately when such substances supply an imagined need is mass education regarding the effects on health and longevity of such indulgence coupled with taking the profits out of the supply of the product involved there must be practical realistic reasons why people should or should not engage in any specific conduct which can be understood if properly presented and the reason why so many people do what they shouldnt is simply that wrong ideas are literally sold while proper conduct is not advanced because of lack of profits because of the secret private nature of dope use and sales the punishment approach only increases the problem as in the old saying that if you pluck out one gray hair two others will grow in its place when one narcotic addict is incarcerated one or more will take his place in the dope market recruited by the pusher or other addicts to be rejoined by the old one when he gets out of confinement thus increasing the problem by geometric progression treatment and free supply for addicts who can not or will not quit will while not curing those now addicted rare if not impossible in the present state of knowledge medical and otherwise prevent the recruiting or spread of this vicious habit because of the billions of dollars in profits annually use of narcotics does not lead naturally or directly to crime users are forced into crime because they cannot get a free or cheap supply of the substances that they feel they must have or suffer even die they will do anything to get such supply preferring nonviolent  crimes if possible so that arrest will be less likely at the same time those who control the supply can charge exorbitant rates because of the tremendous compulsion of dope use an artificial but insistent hunger as compelling as the appetite for food or sex finally lawenforcement officers by choice or chance will concentrate on arresting masses of little pushers usually with only enough activity to keep up their own habit while accepting graft and bribes from the really big narcotics dealers in those rare instances when such are caught as senator daniel points out an arrested smuggler or peddler hardly misses the few thousand dollar bills he puts up for bail bond and his fine how much more willingly will he pay the same amount or even more for police protection in short enforcement will not work because no one will try to make it work and because only a small part of the traffic can be detected the user will not voluntarily surrender to enforced punishment or treatment the pusher will risk anything short of death perhaps even death for the immense return on his investment the policeman will in significant instances fail to enforce the law because of his own greed his desire to share in the profits of dope addiction coupled and justified in his mind by his own recognition of the futility of the present methods thus the get tough policy will not work there is no real alternative therefore to the free clinic plan addicts will cooperate if they are treated humanely and if they can participate voluntarily rather than by compulsion they will prefer safe medical treatment to the risk of death by overdose in the hands of the underworld many of them will be able to hold jobs now impossible for them since as much as  a day may be required for an extreme habit so that all their time must be spent in attempting to acquire big money quickly through prostitution burglary shoplifting and dope pushing on their own in the main under the medicalpsychiatric treatment approach a few may find it possible to quit the habit though it seems to me that we are missing the boat if we emphasize curing those now addicted in the present state of medical knowledge of the problem the important thing is to prevent the recruiting of other addicts to nip the traffic in the bud finally with addicts getting the injections they need or want in clinics not to take out to give or sell to others but in injections scientifically prepared to last for say a day or longer there will be no incentive for pushers to seek new victims who will only turn to the clinics if they become addicted no one wants to make another an addict simply to see him use dope profit is involved in every case consciously or unconsciously a man may lead his wife or girl friend to the needle and turn her to prostitution because he cannot make enough otherwise to support his own habit for example not because he wants her to share his misery mass education in school by press radio and television will take the ignorance out of the dope problem the free clinic plan will take the profits out this realistic approach can and will work and it is the only thing that will work in the present imperfect state of human evolution as a criminal lawyer i would like to be one of the first to sacrifice that portion of my income attributable indirectly to the narcotics traffic on the altar of human betterment unless these steps are taken at once i fear such a spread of this vicious social sickness as indicated by the dire prediction of one of my clients we had better prepare for a pushbutton war if war comes again there will not be enough health and vigor left in our youth to fight any other kind 
negro ministers have not failed have sociologists
by rev charles h king jr
rapierlike thrust of t j dr hares sociologit cal insights into the bocy o£ the nes ro ministry have negro ministers failed their roles left most of us bleeding and bewildered midway through his article i was tempted to throw off my passion for presiding and seek the comfortable confines of black muslimdom where he reports  per cent of my brethren have already found solitude where did dr hare obtain his axe his admission that he is the son of a baptist minister causes further concern how long has this talented young man ignored the couch of analysis at the expense of maintaining his sublimated hostilities surely the deep seated frustration toward the negro church and its ministry must have stunted both his respect for propriety and his training as a sociologist as a former pugilist his ungloved fists struck the negro church in the solar plexis  its ministry i have read with great care and appreciation the other articles by dr hare printed in negro digest these articles revealed a great talent for analytical insights into the problems of a rapidly changing society some showed the unmistakable stroke of genius now for dr hare to take to task the spiritual leaders of the christian church to me is a prostitution of his acknowledged abilities the problem of understanding the role of the minister is not his alone a surprisingly large number of laymen have too long looked into the pulpit for the symbol of the religionist consequently minimizing their own role as stewards of the christian faith elton trueblood in his book alternative to futility correctly identifies this phenonemon we confuse the notion of being professionally pastoral with the notion of being professionally religious    this widespread notion of a man of the cloth a variant of the primitive notion of medicine man is wholly pernicious by making religion as a profession rather than a vocation the ordinary member is relieved of a sense of urgent responsibility and becomes a spectator when he ought to be a participator in short if ministers have failed in their role it is as a consequence of the attendant failure within the pews however the rebuttal is not based on this premise first of all the minister does not hide behind the pious shield of infallibility god forbid the negro church is not rome neither does its ministry claim popeship such a shield if presented would justifiably serve as the instrument to unfrock us  as all of us are bathed in the waters of human frailty again back to the pews we do not entirely blame backsliders elijah muhammad and the bowling alley for the drastic decline in negro attendance but some of the blame must be shared by those like dr hare who view the church with critical eyes while possessing supurb intellectsand idle hands these are the ones who refuse to share the responsibility of the stewardship of their talents to assist the church with its multitudinous problems he then bemoans the passing of the shepherd pastor what does he suggestthat the church of  is the church of his childhood either he is being naive or he fails to employ the interpretive science of his calling it would be the height of folly for me to interpret the changes of the social order just as it was folly for dr hare to correctly gauge the changes of the religious order however since war has been declared i shall risk the front lines with his own weapons charles s johnson in his book the shadow of the plantation stated the church is the one outstanding institution in the community over which the negroes themselves exercise control    it offers the only medium for community feeling   this is a correct definition and it fits well into the retarded age into which the eminent sociologist would retire but this definition of the negro church was made in  a close look at the negro church today defies such a definition the year that he cries out for the return of the shepherd pastor is the same year that the sheep have outgrown their pasture and are now grazing in the total environment of a rapidly integrated society what shepherd can bloom with these sheep indeed it is fortunate that he has time to shake their hand as they leave the church for the complexities of living has become their fold and the shepherd does well to even glimpse their fleeing forms the shepherd pastor has been relegated to the task of an administratorexecutive and the minister who fails to exercise administrative tasks is in severe straits he will soon find himself in a maze of embellishments that would either drive him to the couch of a psychiatrist or to the campus of howard university there he could observe  dr hare and write an article for negro digest entitled have negro sociologists failed their roles to say that dr hares article is without some merit would be absurd we share his chagrin at the deplorable spectacle of our embattled conventions the squabbles church splits and struggles for power however these are exceptions and extraordinary exceptions at that the overwhelming majority of churches and ministers are far removed from the chaotic picture that he paints concerning the days that he deplores nothing would please the minister more than to eliminate these days from the church womens day mens day etc have two reasons for perpetuation the first is that those who are able to support the church disgrace it with their pittances secondly the vast majority of negro church membership constitutes those who suffer deprivation and are on the bottom rung of the economic totem pole suffice it to say the church where dr hare probably attends was built in the past by the welcome coins from days dr hare can illafford to criticise the ministers in the freedom struggle if ministers have used their special position in the negro struggle due to their freedom from white economic pressure and their access to a more or less permanent multitude of ready made followers god bless them and more power to them if the jails could speak they would tell the story of its inhabitants they would declare that their cells contained in virtually every southern state the sons the daughters of the church and the black prophets who led them there the publicity received is a mere byproduct of the cause and in many instances a most necessary byproduct for if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound who shall respond to battle remove from the struggle for freedom the names of martin_luther_king wyatt t walker fred shuttlesworth ralph abernathy kelly miller smith gardner taylor father gibson and other ministers known and unknown and what do you have more is involved here than a passion for presiding and the search for publicity rather let us believe it is a passion for freedom and a search for justice whether these men ride south as freedom riders or sitdown in their own backyards in mississippi it is bringing about a change in the conditions of a disenfranchised race recently in a conversation with rev edward j odom church secretary for the naacp he told me that of the  churches he visited this year the backbone of the entire negro revolt was the negro church and its minister he said take away the negro preacher and the church and the movement will lose its fervor and religious motivation this blow struck by dr hare must be classified as one that hit below the belt without question this round of criticism must be taken away from him the men of god yell foul let this be well known dr j h jackson president of the national baptist convention and millionaire s b fuller are not the images of todays ministers the vast majority of negro ministers cannot afford to drive big cars take trips to russia or fly to make addresses the balance of their time is devoted to picketing confronting the white power structure in behalf of their people visiting the sick burying the dead and agonizing over impossible budgets and then of course preaching the gospel even this dr hare takes to task he would have the negro minister devote his time to considering the horrors of war and speaking out against the massive murder of modern warfare yes it is true we do have lockjaw on this subject an introspective view of war reveals that it is as a consequence of sin in high places what need of battering at the walls of war to a people who possess neither the power nor the instruments to wage warfare why preach the evils of war even to white christiandom when they fail to hear the basic message of love thy neighbor why spend time on advocating global disarmament while rocks are in the hands of white supremacist why argue for a peace treaty with russia while negroes have no communication with the white communities of birmingham and albany ga dr hares remarks on the war records of ministers were so juvenile that to frame a rebuttal would be futile and who might i ask living or dead black or white has added to the wisdom of moses solomon and job if it is true that the negro minister has failed in his role and that church members are flocking en masse to black muslims then his article has abetted such movement incidentally dr hare has a continuous theme of attributing to the muslims qualities that should be possessed by christiandom what are those qualities dare he suggest that morality includes hate indeed the tenor of his speech suggests he is closely aligned with their doctrine if this is so and i know it is not then let him cease from his caustic comparisons and flee to join their ranks the corporeal sin committed by his article was that he failed to utilize his training as a social scientist it was obvious that most of his arguments were hampered by the loud emotional overtones of personal frustration as such he created a stereotype that a mere glance in his undergraduate notebook would have destroyed it is this there are more differences within a group than there are between groups he weakly tries to cover for this sociological error by stating that there are exceptions thank you doctor he adds but exceptions are no refutations of the general condition for shame if the picture that he painted is generally the one of the church and its ministry then i agree with him god help us all for we are men most miserable and not even sidling up to the lawd for reprieve will satisfy our quest for refuge but one escape remains if the leak in the ark of the church is as destructive as outlined by dr hare let us all disembark for our spiritual lives perhaps the muslims will provide us a lifeboatwithout oars 
race and big business
by jackie robinson
any american businessmen feel threatened by the current fastspreading negro revolution they have read the page one news of the demonstrations boycotts selective buying campaigns picketing drives and economic withdrawal programs they know that entire communities like birmingham have been thrown into chaos because there is a new militant negro in the land industry knows that this negro is aware that he is  million strong and has  billion to spend annually the financial newspapers and magazines the confidential business reports and trade publications reveal that a number of important corporations have recently changed employment patterns the american businessman particularly in metropolitan markets with substantial nonwhite populations wonders nervously where the next offensive will be mounted in my opinion both as a negro passionately concerned about civil_rights and as a business executive deeply interested in the health of our economy this threat to the business community can be transformed from a negative into a positive this damocleslike sword can be refashioned into a plowshare which can help to bring a rich harvest of opportunity to american businessmen who are enlightened and progressive enough to lead i do not believe the american businessman up until this time has demonstrated the kind of leadership regarding this domestic crisis which he owes to his own enterprise and to his nations economy by and large he has emphasized the negative he has fear and apprehension he views with alarm the new aggression of marching negroes i suggest that the time has come to go forward with all the courage persuasion and determination with which in the past he has helped make this country a frontrunner in world commerce if the american businessman takes this initiative it is my belief that he will be able to work out a treatya practical working relationship between negroes and whiteswhich can insure our eco nomy not only peace but justice on the racial front it was the business leadership of birmingham which under the most unfavorable and tense conditions found the way to make peace with those who were spearheading the negro protest it was not the state government the city government the religious or civic leaders who moved to bring a halt to the dangerous and seemingly hopeless stalemate between what negroes wanted and what antiintegrationists and governor wallace wanted them to have it was i repeat business leadership this happened i must emphasize in a city which has been called the worst city in terms of race relations it happened at the height of crisis in an atmosphere a few hot breaths removed from lynching during one of the most crucial meetings between the businessmen and negro leaders of birmingham  youngsters were on the march in the streets outside yet a pact was made between reasonable men how much easier and more sensible it would be to resolve our racial problems before demonstrations occur before the picketing before violence erupts before we have been backed into corners and have no other alternative than to try to find reason in an atmosphere of emotion and anger why wait until your community or your business is in the throes of boycott why put aside even for another moment recognition of the undeniable justice of the aspirations of the negro to be accepted into the mainstream of our society economic and otherwise for even if that recognition does not come in your own mind it is inevitably coming in the laws and mores of our society even those who vigorously deny the negros right to equality know that they are projecting a doomed philosophy the most rigid segregationists today are no longer shouting never if they are you can believe that in their hearts they mean not just yetlater they are fighting a holding action seeking to delay full integration i make this appeal through sales management to the nations sales executives because i know that the acumen of this countrys captains of commerce and industry has been one of the major factors in our attainment of superiority in world commerce i know that american leaders have brilliantly anticipated future trends upon which to base present decisions i cannot understand why with all this talent and perception the heads of our great corporations and enterprises have not moved with positiveness to meet the great potentials in the current racial situation they love america as i love america can it be that they have been fooled into believing that the negro revolution is unamerican if this be true then they have forgotten that we would not be here as america had it not been for another revolution which sought vindication of justice and the dignity of the human personality the moderate leaders of the negro revolutionroy wilkins dr martin_luther_king jr whitney young a philip randolph james farmerseek for the negro today only what america promised all of its citizens yesterday and that is the reason they are unwilling to wait until tomorrow howtodaycan the american businessman move positively to meet the challenge of this revolution to strengthen american economy and to enter into an exciting competition for the billion negro market here are some suggestions throw open the doors to the negro on an equal basis do this not only because it is fair that he should have his share in our economy but also because he has a contribution of talent and loyalty to offer to your enterprise do it also because you will demonstrate to the negro consumer that you want his business a friend of ours a new york city industrial relations man has perceptively described the negro market as an invitational market open the doors of job opportunity to colored people and not only will they come in as valuable employees but you will find you have won the consumer loyalty of the negro how will you find qualified competent negroes in virtually every metropolitan city there is a branch of the national urban league for  years this organization guided and aided not only by top negro social scientists but also by enlightened white businessmen and philanthropists has been working in the area of expanding employment opportunities for the negro the urban league is not an employment agency but it stands ready and willing to help supply negro personnel particularly in breakthrough situations or special job categories which have not been available to negroes in the past there are other ways by which negro employees can be found advertise in the negro newspapers you dont have to make any special appeal in these ads negro applicants will know they are welcome when they see your advertisement in their press communicate with high schools colleges and universities contact civic organizations which are working in the field of race relations let it be known among the negro clergy that your doors are open for qualified people the negro clergy has been in the forefront of the struggle for jobs along with the naacp and other groups so by contacting the churches you are going right to the source from which the anti demonstrations have been coming you are turning a negative into a positive you are advertising not only your intentions to give jobs but your interest in the market the masses of the negro people are churchbased for years business people have  said i would hire negroes but it would destroy the morale of my present employees they would refuse to work with negroes hogwash in many cases heads of businesses have utilized this argument as a device to camouflage their own prejudices in many other cases there has been a genuine fear of resentment by white employees it is my belief that the vast majority of whites will not leave good decent job situations because negroes are brought in to work by their side the key to acceptance of negroes by white employees is the firmness of the boss to be a good businessman one has to be a good leader vacillate and the battle will be lost the chairman of the board of chock full onuts william black the man who hired me as a vice president when i left baseball is one businessman who didnt vacillate years before i joined the company at the very outset of setting it up mr black decided he would hire any qualified person regardless of race or color he made this decision because he felt it was the right thing to do and he has continued the policy over the years not only have we maintained a tremendous amount of support from whites we have also over the years before my coming to the company and after enjoyed a tremendous amount of loyalty and support from negroes this is true not alone because of my relationship with the company but also because the negro public knows that the negro can work at chock its a bit embarrassing to say what i am about to say but it makes my point and i cant help being human enough to be proud of it ive been told in some of the stores in harlem where our coffee is sold that some people ask not for chock full o nuts coffee but for that jackie robinson coffee this isnt so much a personal tribute to me as it is indicative of the hunger which the negro has for identification his desire to be a part of what is really going on in our country his pride when one of his own gets recognition and his loyalty to those who give it as i pointed out above the policy of our company allows not only for hiring without discrimination but for hiring people regardless of race on all levels and upgrading those who are deserving one of the serious problems the negro faces today is that some companies which will hire him without qualms will not allow him to advance to whatever position his ability might actually entitle him to the enterprising young negro today wants not only a paycheck but a potential if he has within himself the ability to advance in his company he does not want to believe he will be allowed to go just so far and no further it must be discouraging to him to make a study of topechelon corporations in america and find how few important jobs are held by negroes to my knowledge there are only three negro vice presidents in their executive ranks the two other negroes besides myself who hold vice presidencies in large companies are george olden the brilliant senior art director at mccannerickson and harvey russell who has done a splendid job with pepsicola when chock named me a vice president a friend of mine who is in public relations told me that my appointment marked the first time to his knowledge that the name and picture of a negro had appeared in the financial pages of the new york times when these youngsters realize that their race spends  billions of dollars in america and that thousands of talented young negroes are graduating from colleges and universities yearly it must seem that progress in the placement of executive and managerial personnel is snaillike as to white employees and executives respecting authority given to a negro i have had no trouble in this regard one of the reasons is that when i was named to my job it was made very clear to everyone by our board chairman william black who was president and samuel ostrove who is now president that i had full unquestioned authority over personnel when i first joined chock i did not want to believe i was being taken on simply because my career in baseball had made me a well known person i would not be able to stomach being used as a puppet with someone else pulling the strings i want to work for my money and to be respected and respect others mr black straightened out my apprehensions immediately making me realize that my appointment was not just one of those spectacular moves to capitalize on publicity the longer you are with this company the better off well all be he told me personnel is your job and i want you to do it i said above that i know of only three vice presidents with top companies i do not know of some smaller companies that have tried to win the negro market by taking on some popular negro and giving him a highsounding title with no authority and often no compensation equivalent to the supposed stature of the job this is tokenism these days negroes are becoming more and more alert to the tokenist approach in politics as well as in business if you hire negroesand you shouldmake them aware of the fact that they can advance as high as their ability and the companys table of organization can take them when you promote them to a position of authority pay them what the job commands and let everyone realize that they have real responsibility it is then up to them to produce and if they dont they deserve no special consideration because they are negroes get rid of them just as fast as you would anyone elsebut not faster  demonstrating to the negro not only that your door is open but also that he can climb the stairway of career advancement will bring you people of high caliber who might otherwise seek opportunity elsewhere i have heard complaints from heads of business who say look i want to hire negroes but i cant get any to apply i had a negro applicant the other day who came in for a job when i asked him what he wanted to do he was looking for a janitors job and you know what he had a college education tragically this does happen one of the reasons is that for so long regardless of qualifications and background the negro has been led to believe that only the menial positions are open to him so often he doesnt even bother to try nor is he willing to settle for the lowest type of work there are thousands and thousands of young negroes who would go into companies which to their knowledge had a training program and a fair promotion system they would be willing to start in minor jobs and work at trainee salaries if they had the confidence that there was somewhere to go undoubtedly there are many companies where such conditions exist but negroes dont know it there ought to be some kind of link between these wellintentioned firms and the negro public one solution to this is the hiring of a top negro personnel executive or public relations man or retraining a negro who has intelligence integrity and a balanced understanding of the problems both of the negro and of the white employer who wants to integrate beware however of the adviser there are people like this in every racewho wants to give you only the kind of advice he thinks will please you you are much better off doing business with someone who tells you what he thinks you ought to know rather than what he feels you might want to hear there are two other developments in the nature of the new militant negro he wants to look forward to becoming a race of producers as well as consumers and he wants identification with products on which he is spending his money i have been made very much aware of the interest of the negro in his own economic stabilization within our society recently when the new york times carried a story that i was associated with a group which was seeking a charter to establish a bank in harlem i received many inquiries from negroes who wanted to invest to buy stock or who just wanted to say that this is the kind of thing our people should be doing developing and creating more enterprises of our own although i feel that in the establishment of major business enterprises the negro ought to take initiative and corral group support white businessmen bankers and financiers can help negro entrepre neurs by lending a hand both in counseling and financially as to the negros desire for identification the question has been asked of me whether i thought negroes want negro salesmen calling upon them representing companies and products while i do not feel that negro salesmen ought to be confined only to negro neighborhoods i do believe that representation of companies by negroes appeals to the negro consumer we observed in harlem not long ago a conflict between negro liquor salesmen and the liquor companies and distributors harlem is one of the most lucrative markets for retail liquor sales the community rallied behind negro salesmen who were denied assignments within their own community apparently because earnings within that community were much larger than in certain other areas here we had an example of the negro being denied opportunities created by the money spent by his own people right in his own backyard the sales field is one which offers so much potential to ambitious energetic people the negro wants in on it and negro consumers have begun to question why there cannot be more negro representation in this area this is one form of identification another is in advertising recently the new york telephone co ran a series of ads in which a modestly dressed averageappearing negro was standing in a street  phone booth making a call it was an unsensationally executed brilliant coup for this ad received tremendous attention and i am sure did a splendid public relations job in the minds of many negro people who after all do use telephones too another development which caused much conversation was a recent issue of the new york times which carried several pictures of fashion models one of them was an attractive negro girl this was the first time many of us had seen a negro fashion model in a metropolitan daily i am sure no sensible whites were insulted i am certain many negroes felt a glow and i am willing to wager that this innovation did the manufacturer of the clothes the girl was wearing no harm it makes us feel good to realize america is beginning to realize that we are here that we contribute to the economy a friend of mine told me the other day that he had opened an account at a new york bank he had picked that bank because it has had several television commercials featuring diahann carroll the lovely negro actress the success won by companies which give the negro a sense of identification by using negro models can be measured when one leafs through one of americas finest publications ebony magazine john h johnson ebonys publisher was a pioneer in proving to manufacturers that the negro wanted a feeling of affiliation with their products and that one way to accomplish this was to utilize negro models ebonys million annual advertising volume substantiates the argument to date most companies and advertising agencies are fearful of running the same kind of advertisment that appears in ebony in magazines like life i am hopeful that we are going to wake up some morning soon and pick up our socalled white publications and see a crowd picture with negroes in it or a sandlot ball team which is not lily white i believe some forwardlooking businessmen are going to stop trying to keep it a secret that we are here and that we also spend yankee dollars and i dont believe there will be another civil war or white boycott if a cigarette company runs a back page ad featuring duke ellington smoking a cigarette i know there are attitudes which have existed for years i know there are problems which will not be solved simply i also know there is a tremendous challenge and a tremendous task ahead for americas business community answering the challenge will take imagination and boldness the reward can be more business for you from the  billion market and a sense of having done a good thing for america

nt was very happy yesterday hadnt seen her so  happy for a long long time   cl she had become an american citizen proudly she unwrapped the letters from the governor and the mayor and showed them to me her happiness seemed so pathetic so wanting of something which is essential to happinessbelief that i felt sorry for her imagine she said hugging me effusively the governor and the mayor wrote me me thats a fine action on the part of the governor and the mayor i told her handing back the standard informal letters which bore the signatures of the two officials stamped by anonymous clerks well you can stay here for the rest of your life now i told her she turned on me as though i had cursed her who me not me and these people i can never be an american but you have citizenship now that doesnt mean anything citizenship doesnt mean much to her she says in an effort to cover up what really means so much to her a woman past  here in the usa for five years she doesnt want to be considered an american negro as a matter of fact shes ashamed of being an american negro and this is the standard neurosis of the average west indian immigrant he or she does not want to be considered an american negro subconsciously they believe that the white man prefers them as nonamerican negroes in short he wishes to be the white mans favorite nigger and he may well be happy because he seems to be succeeding in dehumanizing himself this is the color complex of the west indian negro one who doesnt understand the fight for freedom in america one who doesnt wish to understand it and one who even understanding it doesnt have any sympathy for it its a further chapter in the history of the international black mans effort to escape from his skin and his being i have yet to meet a west indian negro who doesnt feel he is better than the american negro and therefore equal to the american white with whom he wishes to associate not everybody born in the west indies can be a sydney poitier or a cleveland robinson two of the many west indians who have entered the mainstream of american life the majority whether they come from jamaica trinidad barbados or grenada or any other part of the caribbean seek to degrade the american negro somebody once said that the immigrant was a mad dog in search of any bone and every time he found a bone he would cross a bridge look down in the water see a larger bone drop his own and run down the bank of the river to be deceived by his unquenchability well the immigrant negro in america seems to be the mad dog with a bone in his mouthconstantly dropping it and finding othersthroughout this long search for an identity sometime ago i met a jamaican in a greenwich village bar i asked him whether he had become an american citizen no and never soon he was lashing out at the defects of the american negro and pretending to be holierthanthey in the castle of his unpopular skin they are animals he said they are this and they are that i challenged his statements oh you wouldnt know he parried you have to work with them he works with themwith some civil_rights organization in new york this young man is about  years old he came here three years ago to study engineering now he works parttime with this civil_rights organization but what can he do in the interest of civil_rights buried down as he is with such prejudices back in jamaica his father is an executive member of some branch of the government his uncle is an internationally respected writer and in his island home hes a prince in a shoe and nobody dares call him nigger or any name to the effect but here in new york or any other part of the united states he struggles hes a black man a negro so in order to retain an identity which can set him apart from what he considers the irresponsible mob he stays in his caribbean closet im from jamaica he says when you meet him but he doesnt even have to say it the exact preservation of his accent will warn you however that still wont be enough to show you how much hes not a part of the american dilemma he will criticize american negroes even going so far as to openly call them niggers and as soon as his studies are finished he intends to return to his island home and become a small bureaucrat he is not unlike my aunt and the thousands of other aunts there are my aunt rents a room from a trinidadiana woman who is an  american citizen a woman who has children born in america but a woman who would never stand to be called an american because once you make her an american you make her an american negro this woman spends her time thinking so many things of the american negro that in attempting to be such a generous thinker she generally manages to outsay those whites who think the worst of any negro they have no morals she says because they drink beer out of cans they dont know how to rear their children they are lazy and without ambition we came here she said meaning the thousands of west indians in the states and in so little time we have educated our children and bought so many apartment houses here in new york but they the american negroes talk of the south why dont they leave the south and come here you tell me i told her that hundreds of negroes leave the south every week in search of a better life but to no avail my words falling on deaf ears she will not rent her rooms to an american negro without the recommendation of someone she respects years ago she sent her daughter to a predominantly white school and the child was accepted as an american negro which she in fact was when she discovered that she branded the child to the childs protests by putting gold bracelets on her wristsbracelets being then a mark of west indianism i was talking to another woman she has two children one at vassar and the other at dartmouth we were discussing the negro childs search for an identity in america oh she said proudly my children never had those problems you know their father and i were born in the west indies immediately she seeks to unmake their americanhood she tells me not to think of them in the context of the average boy or girl because their parents are from the caribbean its the same with almost every west indian parent in the states the majority of them believe that the british system of education is much better than the american and some of them translate their belief by sending their children to study in the islands or in england one of their standard complaints is that the american child who doesnt have the good luck to grow up in the home of west indian parents ends up being badly behaved and ambitionless children in america they say are badly behaved not like kids in the west indies kids who never say no kids who are completely dependent on their parents even while in their twenties they like this type of spineless child but not the fastmoving american child in this tense and unfaithful society they believe that the american negro is ambitionless and uneducated and they maintain this belief even in the face of strong proof of the contrary because its part of the chain of beliefs which helps them to pass their days in another country a crutch to lessen their insecurity they want to see the unfavorable so they see it i have never been segregated says one who has spent  years in the white mans kitchen cleaning his floors and suffering humiliations and i dont see why there should be so many demonstrations and so much unrest i know white people and theyre not so bad she is serious yes i tell her i know that you know the white man but you know him too well so well that you have forgotten yourself but im a fool she doesnt listen and i realize she will die believing the same thing so may god bless her in the west indies everyone jostles for the chance to come to america everyone its the extensive gold mine waiting for intrepid diggers and those who come here are generally teachers civil servants nurses skilled persons and students they come because they want a better life they come to study or they come to work usually they do both but there are also those who do nothing they come out of a society where to be black is a disadvantage once here they start working some of them get good jobs others work as porters waiters etc but regardless of what they are doing they send exaggerated reports of comfort to their island homes while they suffer what they accept as temporary indignities the porter seldom identifies himself with the successes or failures of the american negro since he cant get a better job he offsets the temporary indignity by joining societies and lodges and becoming a leading member one thing he always says he is much better off in the west indies he may return to live there after some years away but usually he stays here on his very tenuous montage thinking that the fact that he came to america as an immigrant and not as a slave makes him so different from the negroes whose forefathers were brought here in chains  years ago there is no valid reason for tms hysteria and false pride the fact that the american negro may have laughed at the african or west indian several years ago is no justification for sniping for the sake of enhancing ones position in nomansland we play into the hands of those who hate us most whenever we naively seek to dish out the same medicine which we have been swallowing for so many centuries yet the tragic part of all this is the fact that we are all guilty in some way or the other of this very subtle crime my aunt is a victim of this society which seeks to put man in different cells of his imagination and milk his essencewhat little he has left of it to divide him and then rule him and when she tells me she is better than an american negro i tell her that what you are is always your constant companion and you can only run so far that when we amputate one leg to improve our gait we stumble and fall in the dust of our souls 
prices are high prejudice is low  so far

a colored american  living in anchorage  alaska you would be  living high on the totem pole racerelationswise alaska has some of a  if   the best antidiscrimination laws in existence and the proper machinery to carry them out despite the necessity of having to oil the machinery occasionally the colored citizens agree that the basic parts are sound as a colored cheechako arriving here cheechako means newcomer the amiable race relations are only one of the many surprises that await you if you expect to flounder in snow over your head gape at slanteyed eskimos on dogsleds yelling mush and live in claustrophobic igloosyoull be let down or up as the case may be with a bang at first glance anchorage looks like many of the towns in the south  which is what alaskans call the rest of the united states with the snow leveled down by the huge snowplows almost before it stops falling you would have to jump into a snowbank to get it past your knees youd probably gape at slanteyed short stockylooking people passing by but you would be confused they wear plain shirts pants sweaters skirts etc and they may be japanese chinese indian filipino or just possibly eskimo anchorage has all these groups you would be surrounded by apartment houses splitlevels ranchtypes bungalows etc if you didnt look sharp you might be run down by a sports car a cadillac or a chevy but on second glance you would see visual evidence of many of the things youve read and heard about alaska sprinkled immodestly among the modern buildings are log cabins and shacks left over from the riproaring frontier days among the passing throng are many fiercelooking men with long hair and beards wearing roughlooking apparel and looking like characters from a jack london novel there are modern stores advertising supplies to pan for gold and food lockers to store the moose and caribou shot in the outlying areas around the town  later you might try to classify anchorage the closest and most confusing description ive heard it called is a cosmopolitan big country town it has all the evils of the big city though in smaller quantities and all the warmth and simplicity of the little town the town largest in alaska and founded in  as a construction camp for the alaska railroad sits on a bluff bordered on the east by the chugach mountain and on the west and north by cook inlet and the susitna valley the howling blizzards and subsubzero temperatures normally associated with alaska pay very irregular visits to anchorage many cheechakos spend considerable sums buying the beautiful fur parkas that you see the eskimos wearing on the picture postcards but in reality the same type of winter clothing worn in the northern great lakes region can be worn here with comfort average temperature for january is  degrees below zero and for july  degrees fahrenheit but to the uninitiated the most startling thing about the climate is the lack of daylight in winter and the lack of night in summer in the middle of winter there is as little as five and a half hours of daylight and most cheechakos find their first winter here very depressing however summer really takes the cake for eccentricity at  oclock at night the sun is still shining bright enough to make little cheechako children believe theyre being tricked when theyre told its way past their bedtime but really frightening are the occasional earthquakes mild since ive been here that keep you posted as to just how insignificant man really is the estimated population is    census with  negroes within this general figure however this figure does not include negroes and others who may live outside the city proper the pioneer settlers of this town naturally were the rough and rugged individualists the goldseekers the furtrappers the law dodgers the prostitutes and adventurers but in later years a more stable group began arriving the farmers the constructionists homesteaders employees of the federal government and the professionals the present population consists of all these groups if you listened closely to the accents of the white and colored people on the streets in the schools in fact all around you you would notice that the far western and the slow southern drawls predominate if youre the type of colored cheechako steeped in the notion that all the white boogiemen and all the backward slowmoving negroes are from the deep south and the far west you would be doubly confused here although both groups predominantly speak that way there is something about their general bearing that implies friendliness and respect toward each other and strangers as well almost everyone is relatively new and they seem to have been too busy getting their feet on solid ground to resent the man beside them there is a general atmosphere of informality of trying to get ahead and of exciting things about to happen however generally speaking there is a lack of qualified leadership a recent editorial in the anchorage times said in speaking of alaska in general the two greatest problems wanting solution today are  leadership and  investment capital speaking of anchorage and the negro in particular there are no negro leaders as such although there are several outstanding negroes in the community when i asked several supposedly wellinformed negroes about this alleged lack of leadership one man commented there are a lot of would be leaders here yes we have great quantity but little quality this was the comment made most often on the other hand one woman said that since the colored folks are able to take a small or large part in almost everything here there hasnt been any necessity for a strong negro leader although there hasnt been enough racial dissension in anchorage to foster a martin_luther_kingtype leader the existence of a local naacp has certainly come in handy to say the least it was organized in  and in spite of persistent internal bickering and external tongueclackings it has proven its worth to the community three of the bills sponsored by it and subsequently passed by the legislature benefit not only the negro but other minority groups as well they are  fepcbill   antidiscrimination bill in housing  and  human rights bill  in august of  the naacp sponsored a picketing of carrs a local supermarket because of its hiring practices within two months negroes were hired the anchorage naacp also participates in activities including negroes outside of alaska in june of this year a memorial service was held in memory of medgar evers the naacp leader killed in jackson miss a total of  was raised at the services to send to mrs evers and her children senator ernst gruening dalaska sent a wire to the services indicating his complete accord with the actions of the naacp through consultations and meetings with housing authorities the naacp helped to open balky doors to several apartment houses for prospective negro tenants however housing discrimination is still the biggest whirlpool in a relative sea of calm because it is accomplished by subtle practices that defy pinpoint identification consciously or unconsciously the leading anchorage newspaper helps by printing ads from time to time of apartments or houses for rent for white only and for colored only  if you were a cheechako colored or white looking for a job here and had no particular skill or training you might curse the day you arrived the population has grownand is still growingso rapidly that even the people already here face difficulties in gaining yearround employment especially those who do construction work or other jobs dependent more or less on construction work with the advent of so many people a permanent labor supply is already here at present it varies from  during the peak summer months down to  in winter so many people have come to anchorage expecting to find their fortunes and have been disillusioned until the anchorage chamber of commerce says in its informational tract on anchorage   we strongly recommend that those in search of employment do not venture north without employment assured or have sufficient funds to draw upon until employment is secured at least  per person plus return fare if job hunt is unsuccessful and we strongly recommend that those interested in business opportunities plan to take a trip and look the situation over firsthand for all groups living costs are high from december of  throughout  a friend of mine rented a threebedroom apartment bedrooms like closets for  a month plus an average  monthly utility bill plus an average  a month for the coinoperated washer and dryer setup in the apartment basement no washing machines allowed in her apartment as you can see this comes to  and food clothing medical expenses and recreation havent been mentioned if you wanted to buy a home in anchorage you would pay between three to five thousand more than you would pay for a home of similar build in new york for instance quite a few prefabricated houses are shipped here and sold and many people live in trailers because much of the food and other merchandise are imported these prices are high also however i must add that wages are quite high and buying from the large supermarkets chain department stores cutrate drugstores and discount houses helps to balance the increased living expenses even so if youre out of a job you can see that things might be a mite difficult there are no set figures but it is estimated that at least  per cent of anchorage negroes work in construction and service jobs in addition to this many negroes work for the city state and federal government in fact the economy of anchorage is primarily dependent upon the government and the military you can hear quite often from disgruntled citizens if they take elmendorf air force base and fort rich away this town would go to the dogs there is more than a grain of truth in this statement but anchorage does have other economic activities going on anchorage is headquarters for the alaska railroad chief center for air transportation in alaska chief center of oil exploration products activities and principal market for the agricultural products of the matanuska and susitna river valleys also with the opening of the new presbyterian hospital and the staterun psychiatric institute plus the alaska native hospital and the providence hospital more jobs have been opened up there is a very small negro professional group in anchorage with teaching being the major occupation oddly enough there are no negro men teachers but at least  women teachers mrs delbert henry an anchorage resident since  and originally from oklahoma has been teaching in the schools since  she agreed along with many others that qualified people can certainly get jobs here if jobs are available she is a member of delta kappa gamma only negro member in alaska an international teachers sorority and is president of the elite social and charity club in april of this year this club presented anchorage negroes their first debutante ball schools in anchorage maintain a very high academic standing and are rated among the best in the country there are two high schools three junior high schools over nine elementary schools a community college alaska methodist university several african students have attended this university and several private schools incidentally school kids are very happy here because even though school opens in early september it closes in midmay aside from teaching the professional group breaks down to one privatelypracticing dentist dr joshua j wright and one privatelypracticing lawyer mahala ashley dickerson both of these people are highly thought of in their field and have a mixed clientele there are several businesses purportedly owned by negroes mcsmith enterprises a store that sells rents and repairs tvs a grocery store a janitorial service a newspaper a cocktail lounge several night spots and a few small eating places there are one or two barbershops and beauty parlors if you need the help of a policeman in a hurry dont look for a colored onethere arent any however there is one attractive negro metermaid at the same time there are no friendly colored undertakers just friendly white ones negro churches as such are in the minority not more than six however negroes attend the church of their choice wherever it is located there are over  churches with all denominations represented however the majority of the negro ministers i heard speak appeared to be more or less selfordained  the masons are the prominent lodge in anchorage and sponsor many dances and dinners throughout the year these activities are usually wellattended negro participation in the political scene is quite limited but one name that pops up frequently in the news is that of mrs dolores watson an outstanding negro woman in the community mrs watson and her husband william have been anchorage residents for the last  years coming originally from yakima washington mr watson came to anchorage to work for the federal government and liked the looks of the country so well that he and his wife decided to make it their permanent home mrs watson is a onetime president and present treasurer of the local naacp and is one of the few negroes who takes an active part in many phases of community life she made an unsuccessful bid for the city council in  but still works indefatigably for street sewer and housing improvement she is one of the two negro members of the anchorage womens club a member of delta sigma theta sorority member of league of alaskan writers and member of the local chapter of the northern lights civic and social club she definitely likes anchorage and was quick to say yes when asked if she would recommend other negroes coming here to live mrs blanche mcsmith was the first and so far only negro to become a member of the state legislature  she is on the board of directors of the naacp and is the other negro member of the anchorage womens club if youre the kind of cheechako who likes to booze it up you would be reel happy in anchorage there are  cocktail lounges listed in the phone book with  of them on fourth avenue the main street in town this doesnt include eating places that serve liquor and little backstreet dives if you stand at one end of fourth avenue at night the end near the inlet you will be dazzled by all the gaudy red lights beckoning to you but considering the number of lights and bars on fourth avenue its uncommonly quiet at night three night spots highly frequented by negro and a large percentage of white patrons are the club oasis the mermaid room and the back street club the club oasis and the mermaid room have lively floor shows with entertainers imported from the states and at times the club oasis presents as many as three shake dancers in each show there are four newspapers in anchorage the anchorage daily times and the daily news are the two leading newspapers neither have a sunday edition and serve the entire community this includes pictures of all local people church and society news then there are two newspapers slanted toward the negro community the alaska spotlight a weekly has been in business for about eleven years and is edited and published by mr george anderson it is a tiny newspaper almost a pamphlet but it reports items in proportion to its size from all over alaska and the south  mr anderson is a republican who made two unsuccessful bids for a seat in the alaska house of representatives the midnight sun reporter is relatively new on the scene being less than two years old but so far it has presented much food for thought aside from its regular news it is also a weekly and is edited by mr jim owens but neither of the two latter newspapers are as strong as they might be if they were in a lessintegrated community if you are a tv fan you would see your programs but they would be shown two to three weeks later than they appear in the continental states there are two tv stations and four radio stations in anchorage one quite interesting event occurs on the channel  morning show each morning except saturday and sunday an employee from the alaska state employment office appears on the program and reads a list of some of the jobs available at the employment service this works extra fine for jobseekers too bushed to get up early and head for the employment agency if youre a budding poet you may get your poetry read by the announcer on the same show that is if you send it in the entire show is rather informal but definitely pleasing the teenagers have their usual platterspinning tv show and are up on all the latest dancesthe sputnik waddle collegian swim pony push and kick etc although anchorage has a large juvenile delinquency problem juvenile criminals here lean heavily toward burglary theft and drunkenness it still seems to be a wonderful place to rear children it offers plenty of fresh air and much space to move around in the teenagers and some adults do a lot of skiing iceskating bowling and housetohouse partying in winter during the summer months which are positively lovely much outdoor camping hunting fishing golfing and sailing are done as a matter of fact alaska in general is rapidly becoming a tourist mecca i must add however that the anchorage negro does not take as large a part in these activities as the negro from the two military bases if youre culturally inclined you can listen to the beautiful music played by the anchorage symphony also since its inception over eight years ago the alaska festival of music has proven to be a huge drawing card for alaskans and tourists alike many prominent concert artists appear in anchorage all year round but especially during the music festival in june ive been told william warfield appeared here and recently carol stanford one negro woman mrs betty mcdonald although not a perma nent resident of anchorage plays a prominent part in anchorage cultural affairs mrs mcdonalds husband edward is stationed at elmendorf as a member of the united states air force besides a regular job of teaching at one of the junior high schools mrs mcdonald has also taught on a parttime basis at alaska methodist university but she is primarily known in anchorage for her lovely voice she is a member of the anchorage community chorus and has also appeared as guest soloist in several concerts the league of alaskan writers which held a successful writers conference last october has one negro member mrs delores watson the name brady jackson is wellknown in the anchorage community he is the retired holder of the alaska heavyweight title and onetime coach of the elmendorf football team but aside from his physical activities he is an actor and member of the elmendorf theater guild he not only acts and designs sets for the group but in may of this year he did such a fine job of directing the play a streetcar named desire that he won a billiken award for being the best director of the  season he won an additional award for recognition of the individual who contributed most to the guild during the season his attractive wife is also a member of the guild one event that draws people from all over alaska and the south  is the anchorage fur rendezvous held in february of each year professional buyers from all over come to bid on fur pelts but one sport that is the center of all eyes during the rendezvous is the sleddog racing the big alaskan huskys come dashing down the middle of fourth avenue pulling the sleds with their drivers egging them on to the finish line for the last two years snow has been so scarce that the sleddog racing has been in danger of being eliminated from the festivities it is during this time that you will see many eskimos in their native dress either just coming to the festival from their villages to sightsee or to participate in the entertainment there is plenty of eskimo dancing and blankettossing etc also at this time a fur rendezvous queen is chosen in  an attractive negro girl miss grace hill was one of the candidates if i didnt mention homesteading in this article a very important subject would have been eliminated this is the word that has brought many people to alaska trying to find a better way of life it has brought joy to some but disillusionment and heartache to many naturally i wondered if there were many or any negro homesteaders in or around anchorage i learned promptly that there are several including the gracious and highly articulate negro woman lawyer mahala dickerson attorney dickerson seems to be making a success of her homestead but many many others colored and white have not been so fortunate or persevering first of all there are two types of homestead lands the free land being given away in alaska is the description of the land handled by the federal government the filing fee for  acres of this land is only  the requirements are that the homesteader live on his land at least seven months a year for  years cultivate oneeighth of it and build a habitable house many people use trailers with the wheels taken off since clearing the land digging a well cultivating and planting a crop are tremendous jobs and costly ones in alaska abandoned homesteads are a common sight on the other hand state homesteads are offered for sale at public auction and up to  acres can be purchased the entire amount can be paid at once or the land can be bought under contract at  per cent down ard  years to pay at  per cent interest incidentally single men or single women or couples are eligible for both types of land there are no special requirements connected with the state lands as there are for the federal lands however credits are given by the state for developments on or in connection with the land for instance land cultivated gets  per acre credit  credit per  feet of fencing etc aside from the high costs and backbreaking labor of getting a homestead established many other factors have to be taken into consideration most homesteads are so remote that gas electricity plumbing and the most common household conveniences are so rare that its almost as if they never existed but if youre the adventurous type if youre charmed and intrigued by the thought of pioneertype living then homesteading is the life for you in the heart of town on fourth avenue there are huge letters strung across the width of the avenue that say anchorage allamerica city most colored americans in anchorage who like high on the totempole racerelationswise say this is potentially true but one old colored man summed up the situation beautifully when he said why yes child this city is prettymuch allright for us colored folks right now but if we dont hurry up and git some more real smart ones who know how to git more and more into everything going on it aint goin to be that way long them others is movin in pretty fast you know

 he postman knowing  the family well hesitated to ring the door bell when he did he said gently mrs bonner itsits fordonnie c o d i can take it back you dont have to accept it you know with trembling hands the bereaved mother reached for the package addressed to her dead son donald bonner at the top left was stamped the name of the sender bible distributors of america almost in a whisper she said donnie must have ordered itbefore his accident such a good boy my donnie how much five dollars plus the c o d charges it all comes to  the postman said but you really arent obliged to take it mrs bonner unheeding she hurried to get the money from her depleted purse counting small change until she had the right amount thank youoh thank you she said breathlessly receiving the package and holding it to her as if it contained the renewed life of the son she had buried less than two weeks before oh thank you and so another grieving family unwittingly added to the increasing wealth of that crudest group of swindlers the grave robbers and hearse chasers these heartless swindlers read the obituary columns all over the country in preparing their salesucker list first the name of the deceased then the nearest of kin preferably a wife mother or husband then so supplied by cohorts in various towns they specialize in mail order deals the articles of merchandise traded most often in this particular scheme are usually bibles religious trinkets jewelry goodluck charms photographic frames wallets pens etc the list is limited only by the tricky imagination of these merchantswho see the sorrowing as ready customers of anything addressed to the deceased about  people die yearly so it is easy to figure the tremendous resource at the command of these sorrowswindlers  these bunco artists specializing in commercializing sorrow are of many breeds and schemes some work nationally by mail but others are just as hard at work locally with moving persuasions for expensive trashyart tombstones or gravemarkers for the deceased cashing in on the grief and sometimeslateremorse of the grieving they find the bereaved anxious to make amends by spending far beyond their means for a memorial marker at this time it does not concern the grieving that the marker is highpriced who thinks of price at such a moment one only wants to do the right thing they are easily persuaded by these suave swindlers that this is the last thing they will ever be able to do for the loved ones now silent forever   but grief can never be assuaged by spending money your late loved ones would not want you to be so victimized so remember this when and if you are approached by any of these or other nefarious schemes you cannot make up anything you cannot spend yourself into peace of mind or relief from any kind of remorse you can only fall into a trap that mocks deep grief a spokesman for the national association of the better business bureaus alert to the various schemes of these swindlers in sorrow offers this advice  accept nothing c o d if you did not order it if it is sent to you on approval to be billed later you do not have to pay for it even if you do not return it  if you are approached with merchandise purportedly ordered by the deceased take time to investigate know your company let those involved know you are making inquiries mention the better business bureau and postal inspector likely youll never hear from this particular company again  letterheads are easy to print so dont be fooled by highsounding ones neither should you deal with post office box numbers unless an address is also given take time to be sure grief is an urgent persuader but it cannot be really helped by becoming a victim of trickery these heartless swindlers are extremely busy and clever be constantly on guard against old and new angles give dignity to the memory of your loved ones use the money you might give these tricksters in other ways that will make a lasting memorial this you know best how to do for you knew your loved one best in his or her name give to a favorite charity church school or individual help or scholarship it need not be a large bequest even a rose bush will bring lasting beauty and remembrance of a loved one death and grief come to all but it need not be commercialized by goulish opportunists when we can make it a lovely quiet memorial of remembrance 
eric was eric

ne thing about him  v eric was himself and r  j all of us accepted him  as a bit strange perhaps he was excep­ v jh   f» tional or eccentric well being an artist should explain away some of it eric was different but he was charming and so he was okay with us the nucleus of chicagos south side cultural intelligentsia tall gangling his clothes hung casually and sloppily on his long brown frame his chocolatehued roundish face was lighted by goggily big eyes which seemed in a permanent state of excitement erics type can be found in any racial or national group he was an artist from hair to fingertips a most creative person his contacts friendships and associations cut across all barriers of race creed and class eric was a member of the human race i first met him at the close of world war ii when he popped up at one of the meetings of our artists council at the community art center he was so talented and charming that has application for admittance was accepted without a dissenting vote we swallowed eric whole hog it was just as if he had always been around we learned later that he had come from out east some place and had relatives there but he never talked about this and we never asked him eric sought out the south side to make his stake he was talented interesting and charming and that was enough his lips laughed often to expose teeth which had grown in crooked on one side in conversation his words tumbled out one before the other was finished not only did he use his voice to communicate but his eyes nose shoulders arms hands and fingers and his entire unarticulated body especially was this so when he talked about art for hours he would rave and rant on realism in art abstractionism nonobjectivism or socialist realism after reading hayakawa it was semantics when he met a group of psychiatrists it was psychology and psychiatry when he became tight with a number of humanities majors from the university it was parrington and kafka it was difficult to keep up with erics various trends and directions shortly after we met him he invited several of us over to the basement on th and giles to see his work we were introduced to his wife pamela a slender olive skinned woman from the cool manner in which she greeted us i assumed that she had long since regretted the impetuosity that induced her to marry an artist eric flailed his arms before his easel like a windmill you see he explained pointing to the canvas i feel as if im going into another abstract period ya ya take for example these storefront churches that ive been painting he placed another canvas before us a stylized conception of what state street used to look like with its storefront churches and primitive designs that were intended to give the impression of stained glass the composition was broken up into small planes of color im experimenting with disintegration of form you see no cant really tell how far ill take it that remains to be seen ya ya who knows where ill go from here we were deeply awed by erics paintings the boldly covered canvases gave a dramatic picture of the black belt which few had the vision to see even the denizens who were penned in there through his eyes the tormented tenements the twisted streets and the storefront cathedrals became a colorful panorama which made our ghetto seem less squalid and hopeless he could really lay on color he was an artists artist and we all agreed to that months later eric announced that he was an expectant father which made it necessary for him to get a regular job this would be good for eric we thought perhaps it would settle him down with his tremendous talent if he could only become stabilized we felt that he could become a significant name in art not only in the midwest but in the country the baby came a girl and he carried photographs of the child as he referred to her in his wallet and pulled them out at the drop of a hat see he grinned see how much she looks like me she looks just like me isnt that amazing shortly thereafter we never knew whether he moved away from pamela or if he was invited to leave but eric announced that he had rented a studio garage in little bohemia near the art center at th and michigan avenue home life is not conducive to my best work he declared i couldnt cut it i have to get away i had to do something this domestic bit wife and kid to support and at the same time this art thing tearing at your  guts and too that twobit job and a twobit boss all of it was beginning to bug me man its got me looking for the couch i had to get out he had a ball fixing the place up painting and nailing and hauling in furniture from the salvage bureau on  th street one afternoon i stopped in and noticed that he had set up a red and white striped barbers pole right in the center of the room probably a prop for one of his paintings ya kate his eyes danced how do you like it the barber pole i mean yeah yeah i just had to have it needed something to brighten up the place gonna paint it over in bright colors got it from that little shop on th at two am the other morning had a hell of a time sawing it too erics head swung around on his neck like a calder mobile during this period eric painted furiously sometimes working on five or six canvases at a time and working all night having divested himself of his job he eeked out money for rent and food with saturday night parties he set up a makeshift bar in the kitchen put some candles in mogen david bottles improvised a cocktail table from an old door got a case of beer and a bottle of whiskey and he was in business those were quite some parties he had up there and they attracted a strange assortment of people those studio rent parties of erics were something else we all used to go to them we felt better helping eric out rather than the guy around the corner who was totally disinterested in art because things were dull over on the east side the university set found out about erics and began to come a sign near the entrance read check your inhibitions at the door the lights were so low in the room that it took some time after you entered to find out who else was in the room there was dancing and music but the most interesting part of these parties were the discussions though host bartender and cashier still eric had time to preside over the discussions as moderator the topics everything art music the dance the theatre psychiatry semantics world conditions civil_rights the jewish question the negro question sex capitalism and communism just to mention a few yes those were some goodtime saturday nights but all good things come to an end and erics parties abruptly ended when some of the parents of the university students lodged complaints against the place as being a disorderly house and too the police were shook about the black and white makeup of erics guests they just didnt seem to dig negro and whites socializing together after a while we noticed that erics paintings seemed to be going through a change he now con ceived his canvases in small planes juxtaposed to each other with heightened color when you looked at them you felt as if the paintings were exploding what im trying to show eric told us is disintegration of reality nothing is constant everything is in a state of change flux either integration or disintegration take the world today it is in a very confused state that is what i am trying to express the state of the world today he waved his arms wildly all of my background is gray dirty dull that reflects the demise of western civilization now take my brilliant reds and yellows ah they reflect the emergence on the world scene of the oriental philosophies zen buddhism and mohammedanism i confided to shep his best friendsay old man erics acting a bit strange these days have you noticed how crazy hes talking seems the same to me what makes you think this notice how he talks way out like and this new kick in painting seems like hes cracking to me so who isnt in this messed up society i dont know i dont know you know eric eric is eric eric will make it then eric informed us that his wife was suing him for a divorce he grinned poor kid she couldnt take it must have started bugging her too really cant blame her when the decree became final eric celebrated with a big party he dropped by my place to extend the invitation ha ha how ya kate ya just dropped in to invite you to a breaking out party breaking out of the bonds of matrimony ya how do you like that didnt have time to get out the engraved invitations from fields you know just think i gotta pay alimony and all this really makes me feel like a substantial citizen after having made a couple of shows at the institute eric decided to try and make it painting full time he sold at the outdoor art fairs and began to develop a following i managed to buy one of his paintings myself on time of course it is one of his city scapes with no people in it a period he went through after he came out of his nude with black net stockings phase it is hanging on my wall now and i could have sold it many times for triple the price i paid for it especially after eric left chicago and the dealers and collectors realized the genius of his work a few months later he announced that the atmosphere in chicago was stifling his creativity that he was thinking of retiring to mexico for a year to paint though he mentioned that he would be leaving in a week or two we paid it no mind after all on a previous occasion he had announced that he was going to spain and before that it was italy then one monday morning shep and i stopped by his studio to see how he had fared over the weekend knocking on the door we re ceived no answer a push on the door opened it eric would be back we thought probably had gone for a weekend in the country but why would he leave the door open with all of his paintings tools and personal possessions inside several days passed but eric did not return word came to us via the grapevine that he had taken off suddenly for mexico it seemed that a couple of kids from the university one jewish and the other gentile wished to marry since their parents were against it they decided to elope to mexico and eric joined the party as an extra driver the only fly in the ointment was that the couple were minors and eric was chronologically an adult thus making him liable for transporting these kids across state lines without their parents consent both sets of parents appealed to the police to intercept the fleeing lovers and their errant chauffeur we had a few anxious days as we prayed that they would make it to the border and across detectives visited all of us at our studios seeking to find out which route the fugitives had taken but in all honesty none of us knew a thing eric was a talker but he sure had sense enough to keep this bit of intelligence to himself we all breathed much easier when an artist returning from mexico reported that eric and the kids had made it he told us that the two young people had married and become reconciled with their families that eric had rented a place in ajijic set one bottle of tequila on the shelf and had gone into business we didnt hear any more from eric for almost a year nor did his wife and child there was a mad scramble for his paintings another artist moved into his studio and held saturday night parties too but it wasnt the same yes erics sudden departure left a vacuum in our cultural set when we wondered would we ever see the likes of him again that crazy nutty unpredicable wonderful unscrupulous fellow one could not easily forget him at least i could not it was a year or so later on a trip to mexico that my husband and i decided to look up our old friend eric we heard that he had because of town pressure moved from ajijic to taxco we had no known address for him but off we went to taxco with the hope that just coincidentally we might find him coincidentally we did arriving in the town square we asked a small boy if he could direct us to senor eric el negro at first the child knew nothing but after we pressed a peso into his palm his memory perked up so senores you look for el senor negro meester eric i tell you you must sit in the club there and wait i will tell him you are looking for him he will come we made ourselves comfortable with a couple of tequilas con sangre and waited an hour passed and no eric my husband and i looked at each other making and accepting a mutual bet that he would or would not appear my husband was the doubter after another half hour had passed he glanced at his watch triumphantly so you got us into this off on a wild goose chase looking for eric he said eric is probably in veracruz or acapulco some place maybe even in jail he wasnt going to show i resigned myself to having to pay the bill then suddenly we heard that high nervous laugh floating in the door hi there folks welcome to sunny mexico ya ya as usual his words tumbled one over the other for his mind raced faster than the words could come out when did youse get to town how long you gonna stay hows everybody back in good ole chi the art center still open the old gang still around sitting down with us he joined in the elbow bending eric had not changed much but wee lines around his eyes and a puffiness beneath them indicated that things were not going as cheerfully as he indicated ya ya me im doing just fine just fine doing a lot of painting started in wood sculpture experimenting with collages also positive and negative space all the time he was talking he was popping up and down running to the door and looking out up the hill we questioned him with our eyes ha ha you can tell them back home that i havent changed a bit still up to my old tricks ya ya theres a little schoolteacher from texas up there red head sent word she wants me to paint her portrait ya ive got quite a clientele returning to the table he said say kate you and bill have another tequila and look dont pay ill take care of the bill im going up the hill and ill be back in fifteen minutes ya he nodded to the waiter mis amigos give them anything they want ill pay when i come back then ill take you guys to dinner si senor eric si the waiter smiled warmly at him erics charm had worked its wonders on the people of taxco too eric felt for his pocket he turned back to us just my luck to have left my wallet in my other suit and ive got to pick up a package at the post office look bill let me hold ten until i get back sure thing eric my husband handed him a bill why it seemed just like old times again i thought we relaxed and sipped on a third pair of tequilas con sangre it was certainly good to see eric again he was a long way from th and michigan avenue but he was still eric when he came back down the hill we would tell him that we had seen his little daughter and that she was growing up quite nicely and still looked a great deal like him and that his exwife pamela had married again or perhaps he knew all that ah but it was good to see him again my husband and i reflected on  the delicious mexican dinner we would have with eric later we would sit and recall old times over some of the good mexican beer it would be very nice then we would take the midnight bus back to mexico city an hour and a half passed and eric did not return i looked at my husband oh eric will be coming any minute now he said lets have another tequila the waiter brought the drinks and placed the bill before us he was apologetic i dont know he said perhaps el senor eric will not come back today my son tells me that senor eric is this minute riding on the bus to cuernavaca he saw him with his own eyes and with him was a pretty senorita with red hair so i hope you do not mind paying the bill  of course we did not mind paying the bill all fifty pesos of it back in mexico city we thought oh well one couldnt really be angry with eric he had such a darn charming way of doing you in ordinarily one would think that we had had enough of eric he certainly had a part of us but curiosity persisted and we always perked up when the grapevine brought some word of erics activities back to chicago we heard that he had married again a redhead that he had been lodged for safekeeping against an irate husband in a local jail that his zany unpredictable action had caused such a strain on the peaceful and friendly relations existing between the united states and mexico that the authorities decided the best method of keeping the peace would be to deliver eric back to the land of his birth which they did pronto eric didnt care to go to texas and california couldnt help itself so the next thing we heard was that he had set up a studio in market street in the bay city with his wife and small boy child the story should perhaps end here with me telling you that eric settled down to family life and responsibility carving a niche of respectability for himself in the san francisco art colony but no the following summer i visited san francisco and having heard that eric was there i decided to look him up remembering that after all he had been a very charming fellow back home and talented it would be interesting to see what he was doing and what had happened to his painting had he progressed or regressed in that disintegration of reality direction he was experiencing when he left chicago it would be interesting to know despite his leaving us high and dry in taxco i remembered him kindly eric was eric sure ruthless he was and irresponsible and unscrupulous but one thing he was charming i inquired and was given an address for him on market street shortly after arriving in town i sauntered out to look up eric finding no one at home i left a note on his door with my name and phone number but received no response i thought our old friend eric must have gone to spain because back in chicago he was always talking about going to spain to live and paint then one afternoon shortly before i was to return home i received a call from a friend of erics youre trying to find eric yes im an old friend of his from chicago is eric all right hes fine just been out of circulation for a few weeks out of circulation yes incarcerated well in custody really you want to see him yes oh yes be down to the county court house tomorrow at  theres a sanity trial eric versus the city of san francisco i wasnt too much surprised even back in chicago we had regarded eric as being a little bit nuts eric must have come into conflict with the existing society poor boy but he was a good old friend and he had been charming and that far from home i felt he needed a friend so i presented myself at the courthouse the next morning i wished to be helpful and offered my services to his attorney so youre an old friend of erics from chicago thats good perhaps you can be helpful and tell us what he was like when you knew him oh ill be glad to do anything i can to help eric well be seated and i may call you to answer a few questions whats it all about i asked eric was doing all right here for the past year painting and selling enough of his work to take care of his wife and child then about six months ago his wife died leaving him with the boy age two it seemed that his wifes death shook him unbalanced him we think and he started withdrawing into himself acting irrational he was taken into custody on charges of neglecting the child allowing the boy to run wild in the street did nothing but sit looking out of the window on market street heard voices through the wall received messages over the radio that sort of thing the attorney told me further that in defiance of psychiatric recommendations that he sign himself into a mental hospital for treatment eric insisted on going through a jury trial as a test of his sanity the city acting in behalf of erics minor child charged that he was deranged mentally and morally unfit to be responsible for the boy erics attorney claimed that his client was not deranged or erratic but merely creative and artistic and that given a job or a patron he would be quite capable of discharging his responsibilities the trial began when eric saw me he twisted around and waved all the time winking his goggily eyes he smiled showing those crooked teeth and seemed totally unaware of the fact that this was serious business that his sanity was  being tested he was the star of this show and was enjoying it immensely the trial proceeded with witnesses being called pro and con the judge was a gentleman of eighty years who clung tightly to a hearing aid the jury staid and respectable people included one japaneseamerican if things followed as they usually did i thought eric with his nutbrown skin wouldnt have a chance my name was called and nervously i took the stand i wasnt too certain however of my testimony in favor of his sanity as i sat down in the witness chair i reconciled my doubts with the thought that any eccentricities in his behavior could be equated with his creativeness artists were different otherwise how could they be artists the attorney for the defense leveled a number of questions at me the answers establishing that eric was an artist of recognized talent when he was back in chicago i told of the shows he had made at the institute and the prizes he had won at the atlanta annual i named a number of prominent midwest collections in which he was included i was proud that i had given eric a good sendoff in this respect erics attorney took a seat and now the attorney for the prosecution stood before me he brought out the fact that  was the only person in the courtroom who knew the accused before he came to california is it true that you were an associate of the defendant when he lived in chicago five years ago yes sir tell me when you knew the defendant in chicago did you ever hear him speak of hearing voices through the walls of his studio no sir when you knew the defendant back in chicago did you have any evidence that he received messages through listening to the radio no sir back in chicago other than the eccentricities that go with being an artist did the defendant act in any manner that would lead you to conclude that he was deranged no sir thank you no further questions as i took my seat behind the bar i avoided looking at eric perhaps my testimony had not helped him at all the trial went on the case was rested the jury recessed having to catch an evening train i was not able to return to the afternoon session to find out the outcome i waved eric goodbye ya kate he called to me while being shushed by a bailiff everything gonna be all right tell everybody back in chi that im okay okay i hurriedly gave my address to one of his friends who promised to write me the outcome three days later back home i received a wire re eric jury hung new trial next month certainly i rejoiced ah that eric a couple of months later a letter from a friend of erics stating that he had been acquitted and had gone voluntarily into a veterans hospital for a rest the child had been placed in a foster home until such time as eric established himself i dont know whether he ever did erics painting of the disintegrating city scape still hangs on my wall the dealers have combed chicago for his paintings especially since a prominent art critic recalling erics brilliant faceted canvases mentioned that eric was a forerunner of the abstract expressionist movement in the midwest now everyone here who owns a painting by him is husbanding it closely including me i cant take you further we have come to the end of this story except for one last note some weeks ago on a return trip to the west coast i asked an exchicagoan how about our friend eric these days what is he doing the kid did he ever get him back nope never did doesnt paint anymore either just sits day and night in one coffee house or other doesnt work you know how charming eric was still is hes built up a coterie of disciples who keep him sheltered clothed and fed hes one of the revered leaders of the beats out this way i was sentimental for a moment he was a zany guy but nice maybe i should try and find him dont cautioned my friend i took his advice and so i cant tell you more about eric but really havent i told you enough already

died in june of  but she is a terrific woman every day is a goday for me lela wilson is seeing a yearold dream come true back in  she and her husband joined an excursion from chicago to view lake county michigan then being developed as a resort area those were the days of a dollar down a dollar a week mrs wilson grins amused now at her own naivete but she was young and she was naive and she fell in love with the thick oak groves and the many hidden lakes she particularly loved one very cold lake cold enough for rainbow trout we didnt get back until  upon return the wilsons bought  acres surrounding the lake and lela promptly named it paradise then the couple had to make money to support the dream rental cottages was one answer i laid floors until i had corns on my knees lela laughs now selling real estate was another they had acquired as fast as they could  acres but we had to have telephones recalls lela to sell lots to city people and electricity the wilsons brought in a private telephone line from nirvana ten miles distant boy what a job she says then we had to keep it up and make repairs i never want to do that again later a public phone company took it over they petitioned for electricity and were quoted an impossible sum so i wrote to governor green michigans governor then lela continues and in  we got it free idlewild now has street lights community maintained by  automobiles were changing american life in every area through dr daniel h williams of chicago the surgeon who first operated sucessfully on the human heart and who had built a retirement home in idlewild in  the area became known as the spot for vacationing professional men and women they came from chicago milwaukee and detroit in the main seeking tolerance in a rustic setting they found it they too wished to build homes lela wished idlewild to grow in the right direction toward a stable responsible community she worked to supply the demand simultaneously she worked to control more real estate to prevent sales in the wrong direction to a remarkable degree the wilsons achieved lelas dream for m idlewild a stable responsible resort town in a beautiful rustic setting idlewild now has  permanent residents who cater to the summer population of  swelling to  on holiday weekends it has a postoffice a police force a fire department and a chamber of commerce of

beyond our greatest expectations lela says shaking her head proudly she loves to drive idlewilds twisting complex of sandy lanes around and between eight hidden lakeshidden by the oaks which only where absolutely necessary are cut down it is the easiest place in the world to get lost you cant see across comers or between streets often cannot see cottages except on lake front this is obees place she will say happily turning into a spacious gravel drive leading to a luxurious plateglass windowed cottage or ill take you past doc nelsons placeturning up another sandy twisty drive she is proud very proud of the fine homes in idlewild and the fine people yet inevitably with a resort which has grown beyond our greatest expectations all is not fine everywhere idlewild governed by the yates township board of five members has no zoning ordinances and it is possible for  jerrybuilt twoweek summer shacks to be thrown together lelas comments on these are few though she notices them fiercely he said he was going to clean up that yard a year ago shell murmur to herself and you sense that soon if at all possible she will buy the property and clean it up herself see that privy she laughed at one point indicating a tarpaper threeholer setting on the corner of a lot near the road i stole it you ask cautious questions not understanding i hauled it away she explains then the judge said he was going to fine me  and i wasnt about to pay  for a privy so i hauled it back she chuckles and you chuckle with her but you get the point any direct action that she can take to better sore spots she will you see her going up the steps to her cobblestone home this tiny old woman in a canvas billed cap and golden strap slippers over lisle hose and she is holding her left hand crooked shoulderhigh because her left side is a shade paralyzed from her first stroke you listen to her talk and her voice does not come fullit breaks and scratches from the effect of her second stroke you notice that her tan skin has pinkishwhite mottles of age you see that she is not the brisk efficient calculating businesswoman you have been led to expect as the queen of idlewild the one whom it is said can make the bank open afterhours lela wilson is in love with the place thats all and everyone who knows her knows it she is shrewd wise wittybut warm with love my golden slippers didnt work out she grinned upon leavetaking a strap broke didnt work out she walks in golden slippers whenever she sees a happy face in idlewild 
apathy excuses ignorance

ome weeks ago on s the twentyeighth of  august to be exact a y baptist preacher stood     j before a congregation of  and summed up the american way of life i have a dream and the country shook with the roar of affirmation from the answering crowd the generation of dreamers from mobile from jackson from danville from savannah gathered in the greatest conclave ever answered yes yes oh god yes and went home united in a common cause yes but home where to the south only there seems to be few dreamers of the kind dr_king represents north of the mason dixon line that is the dreamer who uses his air castle as a blueprint the dreamer whose morning coffee does not act as a chaser to his subconscious visions of manhood freedom and equality was the march on washington primarily a southern affair were the vast majority of northerners party crashers as so many recent newspaper articles attest most attempts to effectively channel the northern dream end in failure or moderate success which is of course the same thing the naacp in boston recently engaged in a power struggle with the boston school committee as to whether the predominance of negro pupils in schools in a predominantly negro community was due to de facto segregation as the naacp would have it or racial imbalance as the bsc termed it in a preliminary municipal election the school committee won a vote of confidence from the city just who bearsor should bear the responsibility for the northern dream or lack thereof the entire community of course but particularly the recent college graduate it seems to me the negro college graduate who comes or returnsnorth would be expected to begin almost at once to transform his collegiate dreams into reality his bold reforms as set forth in his final sociology papers his courage in leading southern sitins his hardhitting editorials in the college newspaper and espe dally his prophetic valedictoryall these point to the birth of a great leader an articulate spokesman for his people in the northern city of his choice what happens he moves directly into the ghetto without so much as stopping to explore the availability of decent housing areas begins teaching what else in one of the citys blighted areas soon buys a magnificent automobile relapses into the monosyllabic colloquial speech which identifies him as in and disappears into the group his bookcase becomes a record rack his desk a whisky cabinet or he comes to the northern metropolis gets another degree or two begins teaching what else makes a good marriage moves into the most expensive section of the ghetto and disappears entirely much of this comes about as a result of our leaders willingness to take discrimination and segregation for granted how can he do otherwise short of avoiding contact with his people upon his arrival he is met by the sad disillusioned host of the unprepared not only the unskilled and therefore jobless but those who unfortunately have prepared themselves for the wrong professions social worker teacher to name two of the most prevalent who have a pitiful tale to tell he listens dons sackcloth and ashes and sits with them waiting what else is there for him to do equality runs in a vicious circle good housing comes about as a result of good jobs which come about as a result of proper schooling and adequate preparation our dreamer must have from the beginning the foresight to pursue an academic discipline which will lead directly to a moneymaking career real estate dealers are interested not in black or white but green show me a few negro analytical chemists optical engineers literature scientists programming analysts radar specialists now compare their salaries to yours their neighborhoods to yours if there were vacancies in their neighborhoods

butor is a v leader among the new ajlvjl  y° u n g writers in france his experimental novels have been translated into english and are read with interest both here and abroad he has traveled and studied in the u s and now in mobile simon and schuster  has arranged his knowledge observations and opinions of us in an intricate pattern designed in itself to express something of the restlessness of the country for fifty hours beginning on a summer midnight his mobile wheels like a hawk over the fifty states in alphabetical order noting significant and not always beautiful bits of the american scene each hour is a kind of chapter from a few words to several pages long the first hour being simply pitch dark in cordova alabama the deep south like the opening phrase of a symphony these four notes of color time place name and historical area grow and proliferate throughout the book to form its basic structure color comes to include observed scraps and pieces of our preoccupation with colors of rugs clothes alarm clocks ice cream cars but chiefly it becomes awareness of race black man white man indian time becomes not only hours and time zones but speed and direetion the accelerating motion of our travel here and abroad how much longer    the planes that leave for paris    the ships that come from singapore  taxi   we took the wrong road we have to go back place names echo and reecho the european americans nostalgia for europe from which poverty had driven them or the names commemorate dead indians indians indian places buffalo historical areas yield natural landscapes seascapes birds plants of this continent they also yield paragraphs of the familiar documents both sacred and profane of our history and of our contemporary life sometimes in his own words or through dream sequences during the wheeling night hours but chiefly by means of elements of these our own familiar documents arranged in strange juxtapositions butor reveals his strong often savage insights for example he juxtaposes excerpts from william penns sacred peace treaty with the delawares a report of the pennsylvania militia eliminating a delaware village which had accepted christianity a history of the trappist monastery with ads for their preserves testimony from a salem witch trial and testimony of a seneca indian preaching a new kind of christian salvation through the peyotl cult the implication is inevitable that christianity was betrayed here by christians during the second midnight over washington d c a not unintentional concurrence the hawkeyed observer suggests that the murder of lincoln in the capital city has assumed the qualities of myth because it is a stunning representation of that obscure and laboriously forgotten primordial murder of red man by white man upon which every city in the nation is founded another clashing set of quotations includes jeffersons all men are created equal his rationalization of slavery the romans had it and proof of negro inferiority his pompous architectural preference for imitation greek and roman temples louis sullivans passion for architectural honesty betrayed by the chicago worlds fair in  and on to freedomland new yorks bigger and better disneyland where the improbable reconstruction of a history that never was is commercially exploited as necessary to an understanding of the american way of life relive the great wild west romantic old new orleans see chicago burn down every twenty minutes keep smiling see how mrs kennedy smiles  the illuminated face of rock hudson   mayor wagner is smiling why arent you smiling    the planes that leave for antwerp    porter the distance between our dream of democracy and the historic facts of slavery and our elimination of the indian has become the schism  between the fantasies of our entertainmentconsumeradvertising dream life and the hot reality of the racial predicament which confronts us today in one sequence a kind of subconscious tirade is addressed to northern liberals by a southerner defending segregation only the south knows the depth of the negros resentment his potential strength and that the whole american way of life must crumble when the negro inevitably rises you have beaten us northerners we who were your ramparts    as we were already beaten by the negro but when the negroes rise up then we too will have that moment of vengeance they have taught us to expect and closing our eyes we will grin the last hour of butors mobile is midnight in eden wyoming and the last place name is buffalo butors picture of the u s coincides too closely with those of such native americans as historian lerone bennett jr and observers james howard griffin and james baldwin to be lightly dismissed as a foreigners warped view a new york reviewer quoted on the dust jacket calls mobile as familiar as our roadsides and far funnier there is the brutal humor of a rough brotherly affection through some passages and theres bitter satire beyond that the book is about as familiar and funny as murder and that reviewer like another who condemns it as a confused inventory of smells tastes and statistics simply demonstrates the white americans dangerous blindness to our national situation that butor is writing about the last quarter of the book drags a little and butors observations are not all beyond challenge since he was here the negro people have indeed begun to rise and not all white americans have panicked away into freedomland but for anyone honestly concerned with building here and now finally and in fact a home of the brave and a land of the free this strong book will be interesting and salutary

the o f united africa
by kwame nkrumah
meaning of the charter the charter of african unity must be regarded as the last but one step on the road to a continental union the exploiters of africa have grasped its implications they realize that we are out to make ourselves masters in our own house and to drive out relentlessly from the length and breadth of our continent those forces which batten upon us and keep us in political and economic subjection salaam in tanganyika this committee will be responsible for regulating the assistance from african states and for managing the special fund which is being created by contributions from all the independent african governments this means that we must accept as our primary task the extension of independence to all territories of africa apart from the sense of oneness and unity which impels us to go to the aid of our suffering compatriots in angola mozambique southern rhodesia south africa and other parts of africa still under colonial rule we know that none of the independent african states is safe so long as a single colonial ruler remains on african soil freedom fighters will take renewed hope and determination from the knowledge that their struggle is identified with the continued independence of the existing african states and is to be directed within a total strategy no longer will these freedom fighters who have been in the vanguard of the african revolution and the colonial liberation movement feel isolated from the mainstream of african independence and unity i am indeed happy that the goal which we set ourselves at our independence has been brought nearer we shall strive for it now not alone but with our brothers from all the independent african states the problem of rhodesia let us make our position perfectly clear on this vital issue in the past britain by force of arms imposed upon the people of southern rhodesia or to give it its natural indigenous name zambia an alien government designed to deprive the people of zambia of their lands and their mineral wealth britain was a party to the establishment of a government composed exclusively of minority settlers who had contrary to all conceptions of justice possessed themselves of the lands and resources of the inhabitants this settler government of southern rhodesia is now demanding that it should be granted independence in other words it is inviting the british government to set up a second south africa in the heart of our continent without taking into account the wishes of the majority of the people in that territory no african state could in any way accept such a travesty of morality justice and international law nor would we accept the undemocratic racialist counter proposals which the british government is reported to have made to the settler southern rhodesian government any government that is formed in southern rhodesia without the consent of the majority of its people will be unacceptable not only would we refuse to acknowledge any such government we shall oppose its entry into the  commonwealth and into the united nations our recognition will only go to a government which in our view is fully representative of the people of zambia that is a government based upon universal adult suffrage employing the principle of one man one vote i cannot believe that any british government could commit the supreme folly and blunder of setting up at this stage of our african struggle for independence and unity a second south africa whose examples of the appalling evils of apartheid and minority rule are so glaringly manifested against the african population every single day i have left the british government in no doubt about the stand we are prepared to take against the setting up of an unpopular minority independent government of southern rhodesia this is a crucial and decisive moment in the history of southern africa the attainment of political freedom by the people of southern rhodesia would not only mean the setting up of a free and indigenous zambian state it would bring a message of hope and encouragement to african peoples elsewhere in southern africa who are denied any right to control their own affairs but zambia will in any event become free in truth of course the situation in southern rhodesia could have been solved as has been the kenya situation but for one factorthe proximity of southern rhodesia to south africa indeed the southern rhodesian settlers are nothing more than pawns in the game of chess now being played by the great powers over south africa the independence of the people of southern rhodesia is not in reality being considered on its merits it is considered only in relation to the south african situation south africa is probably the biggest impediment to the liberation and unity of the african continent and it is a question which we must face squarely and realistically the need for strength i am not unmindful of the grave difficulties which face some of us lack of capital economic weakness and political instability are conditions that have been responsible for the acceptance of economic and military dependence upon former colonial powers in some instances such as is obtained not only for development but even for meeting normal recurrent budgetary expenses it is an act of high courage on the part of sister states thus boldly to have set their hand to a policy of nonalignment which can hardly be in keeping with the policy of those on whom unhappily they find themselves dependent yet it is these states particularly that should find the greatest advantage in developing our african unity into a firmly welded concert of nations as a real political force with political direction under a central authority within which they can shed their economic and military dependence and regain their dignity proposals of aid need to be examined with care most of all we must beware of any kind of military help for it can so easily place us in the hands of foreign powers and make them in effect the arbiters of our fate apart from drawing us into their orbit they become intimately familiar with details of our defense structure and its strength they can even become the designers of our defense structure and place us completely at their mercy aid of this kind even where ostensibly free can be most dangerous costly in its consequences for it creates pockets of coldwar presence on the african continent and lets in the neocolonialists with danger not only to the harbouring country but to its neighbors to whom it poses an open threat above all it creates frictions and disputes that will disturb the unity upon which we have embarked and to which i am convinced all of us are sincerely dedicated that is why it is so urgent for us to get together within a centralized framework that will give shape and purpose to the agreements which we made at addis ababa coordination of our political and diplomatic policies harmonization of our economic educational and cultural activities collaboration in health sanitation and nutritional matters coordination in scientific and technical fields cooperation for defense and security will go their dilatory pace unless the organization of african unity is pivoted upon a centralized authority capable of giving effective political direction to these aims political and diplomatic cooperation cannot function in a void it needs some sort of a political constitution to direct it economic development in separate states is ineffective but with our combined resources governed by an overall plan we can make africa great prosperous and progressive above all the full development of all our countries needs the most economic exploitation and husbanding of our natural and human resources this is possible only on a continental scale if we are to extract the greatest advantage from the latest industrial and administrative techniques as applied to our extensive land mass and population the evil of racism everywhere equally in striving for african freedom and unity we cannot be indifferent to events in other parts of the globe which can vitally affect the progress which we make towards our goal it is in this spirit that we have concerned ourselves about such grave international issues as the sinoindian border dispute and the cuban situation in doing so we were not only serving the cause of world peace which is of vital importance to us we were serving the cause of african liberation and unity as well i believe that the forces now pressing for freedom and unity in africa will be strong enough to overcome any external obstacle yet we must not blind ourselves to the fact that one of the great causes of african disunity and of the maintenance of racialist and colonialist regimes on african soil is the disagreement and hostility which at present exists between the great powers imperialism and the socalled white supremacy are the basic factors of instability in africa and one of the contributory causes of world tention secondly unless the situation in south africa improves radically so as to afford opportunities for the majority of the citizens of that state to express their will in a government of their own country this could be a theatre for a world conflict racial oppression and injustice in any form cannot be condoned or ignored racialism is a blot on the conscience of mankind and the sooner it is removed the greater the prospects of world peace will be it is in the same context that one has to consider the problem of racial discrimination in the united states although the efforts now being made by the government of the united states to bring about a a solution to this longstanding problem in america are appreciated it must be stated that nothing except a bold and revolutionary assault on this moral obloquy and this grave crisis of racial confidence in the united states can bring about a speedy solution the afroamerican has been taught to appreciate the dignity of the individual living as he does in one of the most technically advanced countries of our time and yet at the same time he is being denied what is his essential and inalienable right the afroamerican did not choose to go to the new world he was dragged into america to help establish the economy of that country this he has done with great credit distinguishing himself in all fields of human endeavor in music law diplomacy art science and education he has achieved great distinction for america the united states has therefore a moral duty to accept the essential humanity of the afroamerican time is of the essence this at once raises the matter of speed and urgency this is everything in our march we must in africa crowd into a generation that experience and achievements attained through centuries of trial and error by the older nations of the world we do not wish to see africa set on a course in which her nations grow indifferent separate and competing directions until they develop into a confused and disorderly economic tangle of sixes and sevens because europe has become the victim of such economic circumstances that is surely no reason why africa should follow a similar course those who set the example of europe as an illustration for the need to develop step by step in africa do not seem to appreciate that africa need not begin by imitating the mistakes of europe after all what use is the experience of human progress if we who study its course fail to learn from its errors and muddles as i said at addis ababa this world is no longer moving on camels and donkeys speed has become a new potent factor in the progress of the world the progress of the modern man like the agile kangaroo leaps and jumps more than that we have to remove the gap between those nations and ourselves if we are to emerge from the grip of the economic imperialism that will retard us the longer it remains a master or even a part of our economy we have to keep in mind however that the gap is not a static one but that it grows as modern technology improves and its productive capacities and output potentials increase thus the gap can widen seriously and new dangers threaten us unless we hasten forward at a much accelerated speed consciousness of the time element among the leaders of independent africa was clearly revealed in the course of our deliberations at addis ababa this awareness enabled us to examine our problems with a striking sense of urgency it was responsible for the speed with which we were able to adopt a charter of unity for africa why then cannot we observe the same consciousness of time and the same sense of urgency in pushing forward our unity into a form that will give it direction and authority so that we can speedup our common development and advancement in the horizon of africas future i see clearly the bright dawn of a union government the birth of a great nation which is no longer the dream of a new utopia africa the sleeping giant is now awake and is coming into her very own
