are negroes culture shy
by fletcher e dalton
am constantly appalled b y and concerned over the absence of negro patrons at events of general cultural importance in this country so seldom are there negroes attending events relating to the fine arts concerts lectures plays ballet that when i see a mere handful i feel especially blessed to what can this condition be attributed one excludes here the student and teacher of the arts although their representation is small whose interest after all is professional it is the general public with which i  am concerned although negroes are frequently encountered at vocal performances along the eastern and western coasts opera and song recitals i have yet to see more than a score per season at orchestral concerts or instrumental recitals i would be willing to wager that not one of the major orchestras in the country can count on more than a dozen negro subscribers the situation worsens where the dramatic stage is concerned it was pathetic to view the small negro audience proportionately speaking which viewed purlie victorious ossie davis uneven but strikingly good comedy which enjoyed an enthusiastic press reaction and was produced on broadway a member of the cast of fly blackbird a play dealing with the race problem deplored the lack of negro attendance in a letter to the new york times patterns differ however in the south obviously discrimination or segregation has been the bar to attendance of things cultural negroes were summarily turned down at the box office except at federally or municipally owned places of entertainment but is this prevailingly the case today i submit that the anticipation of being turned down is enough to deter many wouldbe patrons but if the tickets were secured somehow would they be refused at the door perhaps so my first memory of a concert however is that of a rubenstein recital at womans college  in greensboro north carolina at which my father and i were the only negroes present upon presenting our tickets ordered by mail we were shown to our seats with all due courtesy we enjoyed without anxiety or apprehension of any kind one of rubensteins best solo recitals i am sure this could be repeated in many southern cities but some positive effort has to be made on the part of the negroes themselves two years ago after the triumphant debut of leontyne price with the metropolitan opera association of new york when negro patrons were herded into the balcony of an atlanta theatre regardless of ticket location they lodged a protest which brought from general manager rudolf bing the declaration that the met would no longer play before segregated houses some time ago when the national road company of porgy and bess played in north carolina negroes it seems were refused tickets women then borrowed white children and went in great numbers as babysitters i am sure that the presence of negro actors and actresses on both the dramatic and the musical scene is rewarding in itself and that one should get out to see them perform as much as possible to go out only when they appear however is a strangely twisted form of dilettantism rightly one may rave over the performance of diahann carroll in no strings after all she has created the role hollow indeed however is the praise lavished on a price performance of aida an opera given perhaps as many as three times a week by various companies in new york city alone when it comes solely on the basis of vicarious experience through newspaper reviews wordofmouth reports or oneusually the firstvisit to the opera house the world of the fine arts like the world of sports is valid in and for itself it is only highlighted by special performers do we watch baseball games and boxing bouts only when we can directly identify with one of the participants a game by the new york yankees was no less exciting than a dodger game some years ago when the former had no negro players the addition of elston howard and others to the roster has added an extra dimension perhaps but the games are still worth watching even when howard is not in the lineup though we are absolutely glued to the tv when the globetrotters are playing we do not pass up a basketball game because the teams happen to have no negro players one could i suppose build up experience by attending only performances in which negroes appear comparing and contrasting various interpretations of the same role i should imagine that those people who last saw othello with paul robeson are growing rather weary with waiting for another negro to achieve such fabulous prominence in the role one would envy those persons who could afford to commute between paris and spoleto to compare grace bumbrys portrayal of carmen with that of shirley verrettcarter fees demanded by performers are high and there is little or no governmental support for the arts consequently box office prices are often extreme negroes are no longer only in professions at the bottom of the pay scale but even if they were they could afford live performances once in a while naturally one must be selective in the large cultural centers of the northeast and west in the small townships and in the south generally speaking one must take what comes along colleges and universities put on firstrate concert series and many municipal organizations put on free events of great variety if one must pay prices for nearly all cultural events usually begin at or under  a fee which many movie houses get nowadays especially when the spectaculars are presented speaking of movies it is said that the nationwide lack of negro patrons at raisin in the sun helped it to be withdrawn much earlier than it would have been what argument can possibly justify this for those who prefer better locations tickets range upward through    even to  as for the last stated ostentation is everyones privilege for those who decry these prices standing room is frequently available often providing the best overall view in the theatre in short neither high admission prices nor lack of opportunity except in isolated instances can be called effective means of barring negroes from attending high calibre events if it is due to lack of previous exposure the remedy is pleasant and easily attained in a recent statement president kennedy noted that last year more people attended concerts than baseball games without forsaking the latter can we not be more highly represented at the former  
fepc 
is not enough 
by william l becker
bout  per cent of y the nonwhite citizens of the north and the west are now covered by fair employment practices laws but it is already apparent that laws prohibiting discrimination in employment will not in themselves provide equal employment opportunity for the negro mexicanamerican or puerto rican communities it is probable that no one really expected them to but in any case next steps are now in order the basic approach of fepcs has been that of merit employment the employer is enjoined to hire the best most qualified man regardless of his color or religion or national origin if an individual whatever his race is refused a job because someone better qualified is available the employer is not discriminating in the eyes of the law he is discriminating only if he denies the job to a negro or other minority person who is the best qualified for that job and then gives that job to a caucasian who is less well qualified the problem here is that fepcs prohibit discrimination only at the time when the actual decision to hire or to promote is being made the discrimination and segregation which have taken place for the many generations before that time of decision are not a factor in the law yet the minority person typically brings this historical disadvantage to the employment office on the other hand if an employer who recognizes this background problem wants to make a special point of employing more negro workers he may not place an order with an employment agency asking for negro applicants in many of our fep states he would be violating the law if a labor union wants to make a special effort to get more negroes placed in jobs in its jurisdictionpossibly in the face of some employer resistanceit too may be violating the law especially as it applies to the hiring clause of its contract this is especially ironic in those situations where for years the union has catered to employer requests for an italian speaking worker for this neighborhood or an oriental for atmosphere it is true that an employer may take care to advertise his job needs broadly and especially to get coverage in the minority communitys newspapers and radio stations he may then hope that more minority people will apply for the jobs this is not against the law but if minority people do not respondand this is often the casemust he end his efforts or be in violation of the law the lack of information in the minority communities is a very serious problem if a substantial number of negro workers is put to work in a previously allwhite industry the word eventually gets around but if there is no community experience with this employment opportunity and the employer is relying on the newspapers and the radio the message may not get through communications cannot be good with communities who have so long been alienated from the mainstream of american life lack of complaints the small number of complaints actually filed with the fep commissions is one result of this lack of information and communication the surveys reveal a much greater incidence of discriminatory practices than the number of filed complaints would indicate another weakness that has been revealed in the present fepc structure concerns the complaint procedure most fepc laws are built around the filing of a verified complaint while it is true that many job practices are improved because of the processingpossibly even the filingof one individual complaint it is also true that fep commissions have had to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction lack of evidence or lack of proof at least  per cent of the cases filed the trailblazing efforts made by a number of fepc officials where despite a poor case they have found evidence of discrimination with which they were able to deal has been a valuable contribution to the methods of achieving progress but this only highlights their almost complete dependence on complaints and the severe limitations resulting from so few complaints actually being filed a commissions right to initiate action wherever it sees discrimination regardless of whether any complaint has been filed becomes critical under these circumstances a federal law based completely on response to complaints would be most effective in those areas where the minority population has had the most developed aspirations and sense of individual rights in these areas a federal law is needed least in the south on the other hand unless there is an organizational approach to the filing of complaints by the naacp or core or by the southern christian leadership movement few complaints will actually be filed drafters of fepc bills and proponents of fepc bills need to keep these problems in mind those who are attempting to administer present laws are well aware of them need for training but these technical deficiencies of fep laws are dwarfed by the problems of inadequate training in a period when the number of jobsespecially jobs requiring a minimum of skillseem to be declining in the long term curve unskilled and semiskilled males of all groups will be hard pressed to keep steady jobs the negro who is displaced by automation finds his problem compounded by the history of discrimination to which he and his race have for generations been subjected he is unequal to the guarantee of equal opportunity despite his years of hard and conscientious work because in comparison with the white jobhunter he starts with an inferior education and because of prefepc discrimination no experience in those jobs which might now be open to him there are many statistics on the current increase in technological unemployment but a few will suffice here in the last ten years the index of manufacturing has climbed from  to  but the number of production workers has remained at the  level gerard piel publisher of the scientific american writes it is evident that the number is now due to decline the rate of unemployment for negro workers remains constantly about twice that of white workers in  about  per cent of the white workers in the country were unemployed as against about  per cent of nonwhite workers in  about  per cent of the white workers were unemployed as against about  per cent of nonwhite workers in other terms unemployment among nonwhite workers multiplies twice as fast as unemployment among white workers the impact of automation on negroes in skilled jobs is dramatically illustrated by a picture in business week of jan   showing clerks being replaced by machines in the spiegel mail order house in chicago in one picture a large number of negro clerks are shown at work in order filling departments in the next picture a few mixed negro and white clerks are at work in a large room filled with machines it is to be noted that mr spiegel obviously has made a special effort to hire more than the usual proportion of negro employeesit is the machine not the white worker who is the competitor  but it is minority youth in or just out of high school who are having the most difficulty finding employment youth in general make up a disproportionately large share of the unemployed in a study quoted by dr conant in slums  suburbs we find that in june  the unemployment rate nationwide is something over  per cent for all age brackets but unemployment among youth under twentyone years of age is about  per cent or more than twice the nationwide rate for all workers the department of labor has estimated that  adolescents will enter the labor market in the sixties which of those will get what jobs exist on the basis of the pattern we see today negro youth will have much the rougher time landing a job dr conant reports in a slum area of  people mostly negro a sampling of the youth population showed that roughly  per cent of the boys and girls ages sixteen to twentyone were out of school and unemployed when one considers that the total population in this district is equal to that of a goodsized independent city the magnitude of the problem is appalling and the challenge to our society is clear need for counseling unless these negro boys and girls have been  much better counseled by their families or their schools than is usually the case the kind of unskilled or service industry jobs they have been thinking of getting may not existfor them or for anyone else donald n michael in cybernation the silent conquest argues that service activities will also tend to displace workers by becoming selfservice by becoming cybernated and by being eliminated there may be other jobs or at least as a result of fepcs there may be other jobs from which they are not barred because of race but they may never have heard of these jobs perhaps they did hear of them but did not consider them early enough in life to prepare for them with the necessary high school courses and the basic high school diploma which becomes a prerequisite to enter the training program for such better jobs and if our negro youth did take what courses were available to him and did get his high school diploma the slum school is too often our least effective educational institution especially at the secondary level its problems are greater but its staff and its budget are usually less its students need more special counseling and motivation than the college preparatory student but they usually receive less than those who by home background and teacher inspiration are already motivated the inequality of their total preparation for the job market is enormous if this is true for the northern city slum school how much more is it true for the many segregated and lowstandard schools of the south the south alone does not pay for its neglect youngsters from these southern schools come north looking for work fepcs are too limited to be of much help to this mushrooming group of unprepared unemployed young people fepc in good faith gives them a key to the world of work but the door has a double lock and the other key is education the basic economic problems of america will keep a substantial number of americans out of work regardless of race or religion until programs are developed to meet the problems which automation brings as things stand now however americans who also belong to one of our racial minorities do make up and will make up a disproportionately large share of these unemployed approaches to equality it would now seem necessary to develop some more affirmative approaches to the problem of equal employment opportunity it would now seem necessary to move from a neutral emphasis on eliminating discrimination at the point of hiring to an emphasis on programs which will selfconsciously place more minority workers in more and better jobs the civil_rights slogan of merit employment cannot be allowed to become a selfimposed limitation on efforts to achieve equality in employment some of the approaches of the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity do seem geared to accomplish this purpose the requirement of annual progress reports from  firms employing fifteen and a half million workers does not merely ask these employers to show compliance with the antidiscrimination clause in their government contract it also asks for a report on what positive progress has been made the plans for progress which are voluntary agreements with about thirty of the nations largest government contractors go even further the rca plan for example lists under plans for continuing affirmative action  added emphasis to existing programs for the purpose of seeking out greater numbers of qualified negro and other minority group applicants through a concerted effort during hiring campaigns the objective is to increase such groups representation in occupations at the higher skill levels  directives to employment and personnel managers at all locations to increase their contacts with negro organizations and other agencies in the development of qualified candidates for job referrals  a general program of guidance and encouragement to be made available to negroes and other minority group employees to stimulate upgrading training and transfer potential within their occupational specialty training managers at each location to arrange periodic sessions with individual employees or with groups of interested employees  a positive program of action to be undertaken for the appraisal and counseling of negro and other minority group employees who appear to have potential for advancement into supervisory and management positions the emphasis of the presidents committee is not on single cases of discrimination as it is with most fepc work but on the overall affirmative goal of employing more minority people the federal government can make other important contributions for example it is not enough to prohibit discrimination in the apprenticeship programs which receive government assistance it is important to take steps to provide for more apprenticeship training programs and more opportunities for the employment of apprentices equal opportunity is important but at the present time it is scarcity of apprenticeships which is being shared  in california alone for example collective bargaining agreements are said to provide for about   apprentices but employers are willing to employ only about   this year of these  over  are in the carpenters program so the opportunities in all the remaining  programs are very limited indeed it would help if the government would stipulate that every federal contract must have joint labormanagement apprenticeship training programs good vocational guidance programs are now administered by some state departments of employment these are especially helpful to young people this resource is not sufficiently used by minority people the federal government through its possible control over these state departments could make effective job counseling a service available in all states and to all people it could coordinate this counseling service with the training programs for national manpower needs for which the federal government must take increasing responsibility it is also necessary for government employment which is constantly expanding to develop a more conscious overall pattern of equal opportunity there is now substantial minority employment in government jobs but it varies from area to area from department to department and from job level to job level often depending on the prejudices of the local hiring officer here too it is necessary to go further back than the point of hiring for in some areas according to the united states civil_rights commission no negroes applied for the necessary civil service examinations perhaps while most of the schools in the south are still segregated the negro schools can play a special role making sure that their students are informed of possible civil service examinations and their requirementsand the fact that the federal government may not discriminate in employment at least not without violating a presidential order in short it is now urgent to recognize that the active measure of success for equal employment opportunity is not just the low number of discriminatory practices but the high number of minority people who are actually being hired the social remedy lies in a range of positive steps from improving the existing fep laws and practices to special training and recruiting programs to perhaps a drastic retooling of public school programs fep laws are an indispensable first step towards the achievement of equal job opportunity but even at best only a first step 
im sick of
by horton floyd
m sick soul i and tired of yes i am i say this» knowing fuu weh  that i will draw upon myself all the wrath and venom of a whole multitude of soulshouting chauvinists more intent on terror than on truth but it is about time that someone punctured the big balloon of budding black supremacy and it might just as well be me first let it be clearly understood that ilike most fairminded clearthinking americans negro and whitefully understand the emotions which drive so many negroes to seize what they consider a racial virtue and to attempt to raise it to the level of a unique and exclusive badge of superiority the racist practices which degrade and dehumanize negroes in this country deserve the worst possible opprobium it is madness but must negroes ape this madness if madness is to be fought with madness then what is to happen to sanity one of the legacies left by our negro ancestors was an enduring sense of simplicity and saneness must we abandon our heritage in the act of defending it in a brilliant article in a recent issue of the progressive magazine columnist murray kempton wrote we all americans owe to unknown southern negroes whatever has been epic in the history of the united states for the past ten years cooks and maids poor isole farmers students in colleges that hardly have libraries have become authors of that history kempton is a white man one who understands how racism can drive people to depths of depravity on the one hand and to great heights of nobility on the other hand and he knows which hand will hold the victory they will win who cling to honesty and truth and a vision unclouded by hate and revengehowever meritedand to the promise always inherent in the idea of freedom and dignity but the fanatical adherents of the cult of soul do not seem to understand this they are playing the enemys game by isolating what they believe to be a superior negro characteristic they are merely giving credence to the racists dogma they have swallowed the propaganda of racial superiority and are trying to twist it around to serve their own undernourished egos to begin with just what is this thing called soul stripped of emotion it seems to stand as that quality of negroness resulting from the fact of racial oppression and denial physiognomy aside negroes differ from whites in america in proportion to the degree of variance of their life experiences the american culture is a manyfaceted thing andcontrary to the preachings of the silly southernersthe pattern of life devised by negroes in an effort to overcome the obstacles strewn in their path is one of the central elements of the complex whole this negro subculture as the sociologists call it infused as it is with hurt and anger and anguish and love is the fertile womb of the concept called soul as expressed in muthe calm indomitable elegance of marian anderson the cool hard determination of james h meredith these are the qualities bred by suffering and denial and the strong unbreakable faith in human dignitywhich is a strong unbreakable faith in self but the negro is merely expressing in his own very special way the same qualities of character and perseverance which other races and  sicwhich seems to be the principal medium through which it is expoundedsoul is the sorrow and pain and joythe tonal sum total of the negro experience it is the salty blues of dinah washington the wailing laments of ray charles and the sweet bitter soaringly melancholy notes from the horn of miles davis and it is more it also is the lilting searching imageshattering prose of james baldwin the loping insinuating panthery grace of sidney poitier  other peoples express in their different ways the soul cultists would have the world believe that those characteristics bred by the negro experience are ipso facto superior this is pure nonsense the negro does indeed stand at this moment in historyin a morally privileged position but this is a gift chiefly given him by the folly and failure of white people in the pursuit of their vaunted principles by practicing rampant racism in the face of all the noble declarations about freedom and democracy white people have surrendered their right to identification with these precepts negroes can yet lay claim to these principles for circumstances have not provided negroes the opportunity of betraying them not yet that is but the black chauvinists are certainly doing their part to throw away whatever moral advantage the same logic apply in other areas to other art formsto opera for instance since opera is the creation of white people developed out of their experiences it therefore follows that no negro can sing it with appropriate feeling leontyne price then can never hope to equal the performance of renata tebaldi in interpreting the music of the italian composer verdi on the operatic stage and grace bumbry negroes may have in this ugly racial rivalry take the question of jazz for example in recent months a great wave of militancy has swept over certain negro jazz musicians and jazz lovers jazz they declare fire in eyes is a negro creation born of the travail and heartache and primeval memory of the race and therefore no white man can feel it and play it with the proper amount of soul well okay for the sake of argument assume this is so would who had the singular honor of singing the german wagners music at the great bayreuth festival should have accepted beforehand that she could never match elizabeth schwarzkopf as venus absurd worse plain silly leontyne price and grace bumbryand a whole handful of superlative negro singersare extraordinary vocal artists capable of performing operatic roles on a par with their white peers the fact of race is just inconsequential and white vocalists like barbara dane and anita oday can sing rings around a whole host of runofthemill negro blues singers and will match some of the best can diahann carroll sing the blues better than peggy lee because diahann is a negro and peggy is white well the answer to that is obvious diahann is a singer of sweet and sophisticated songs and she brings such an exquisite quality to them that the great richard rodgers who is white wrote a musical for her on the other hand peggy latches onto a barrelhouse number as if she came from rough and ready lower basin street rather than the placid plains of jamestown north dakota when it is a matter of style with these two lovely ladies race is irrelevant i want to make it perfectly clear yea to even emphasizethat i am not saying that negroes do not bring a certain indigenous quality to the blues that they do is selfevident but by the same token it is not true that only negroes can sing the blues any more than it is true that only whites can sing romantic balladsor opera american negroes have much to be proud of no group of people in this countryand few in any countryhave had to struggle as long and as hard against such strong and unrelenting forces in order to enjoy a measure of freedom the battle has been fought with great valor and with even greater dignity and the american culture has been glorified and enriched by the negros uncommon faith and perseverance but as splendid as the negros fight has been it has not been really unique considered in the vast context and panorama of history courage and determination are traits that belong to the human race not merely to the negro race nothing could be more selfdefeating than the idea that negroes share some superior natural virtue alien to the rest of mankind this is rabid racism no matter what other name it assumes and that is why i am sick and tired of hearing all this boastful talk about soul soul is merely an esotericsounding concept disguising the ugliness of racisminreverse and i want no part of it neither now nor ever 
commenting upon the contents of this volume the authors wrote in  the picture of life in that emerges from these chapters is a candidcamera shot of the community in the final stages of the depression and in the midst of the second world war depression and war have passed peace and prosperity prevail the reader will no doubt want to know to what extent has the community changed during the past  years bronzeville as a compact and selfconscious community still exists there has been very little change in the fundamental values of its people or in the basic social structure and cultural patterns of the community if we compare the content of the chicago defender as described in black metropolis for instance with that in the worlds greatest weekly of today we find that the basic themes and orientations persist although details have changed church and club news is still reported in elaborate detail and race heroes and race leaders are still big news although joe louis has been replaced by rafer johnson and archie moore and haile selassie by the new african leaders stories about martin_luther_king now compete for space with those about oldline politicians and race leaders and there is an increasing number of firsts and a diminishing number of onlies even a cursory tour of bronzeville will reveal that the measure of the man remains the same and that much of life still revolves around those axes of life originally selected for discussion staying alive getting ahead having fun praising god and advancing the race the changes which have occurred are related primarily to two crucial facts of the s namely that america is experiencing a period of prosperity and that negroes are living in the era of integration by  the lean years had gone just staying alive had ceased to be the problem for most people negroes were beginning to sing happy days are here again instead of moaning ive been down so long down dont bother me by  money had been circulating freely and rapidly for over a decade credit had been made easy through budget plans and wage assignments and in  it was even possible to find an ad like this in the negro press everyone rides we guarantee you a car even if youve had a repossession garnishee or judgment no comakers needed fine clothes new furniture and household gadgets ubiquitous tv and radio sets as well as a plethora of cars give visible evidence of bronzevilles participation in the abundance of the affluent society the negro population of chicago doubled between  and  bronzevilles doctors dentists lawyers preachers and businessmen captured a sizeable share of the dollars circulating in the expanded and to some extent captive black belt market their offices churches and homes reflect the new prosperity as do newspaper notices of frequent continental and occasional intercontinental travels and the elaboration of social rituals the addition of new neighborhoods to the black belt has increased the number of negro aldermen in city hall and has resulted in more precinct captains ward officials and jobs for the boys as well as symbolic appointments to high office the business center of bronzeville has shifted two miles southward as the community has grown in sizefrom th street to rd street negro entrepreneurs have opened up numerous new restaurants taverns liquor stores hotels barber shops and beauty parlors some negroes have also made a killing in real estate negro cab owners have not only expanded their illegal but protected business of running jitney cabs on bronzevilles main thoroughfares but they have also won the fight to operate their metered cabs throughout the city negro insurance companies have held their own and some have prospered greatly although they are still pygmies beside giants like metropolitan and prudential morticians too have profited from the population increase a highly successful sausage company and a   cosmetics enterprise are both selling to the broader white market but these are the exceptions which prove the rule that negro business still caters to a predominantly negro market the most spectacular business successes during the past decade have been scored in the publishing field one enterprising bronzeville publisher has nurtured his magazines ebony jet tan and negro digest to the point where they not only attract a high volume of national advertising but are also sold on newsstands throughout the country and overseas a daily defender has been in existence for almost five years to supplement the weekly chicago defender both publishers have purchased property in neardowntown chicago and moved their businesses there a bronzeville businessman has  bought the pittsburgh courier and now publishes a chicago courier as well for the benefit of readers in black metropolis the new crusader has replaced dynamite as a sensational race conscious agitational organ carrying the slogan negroes must control their own community the preachers have taken full advantage of the fat years to pay off mortgages and to build new churches and remodel old ones attractive modernistic edifices have sprung up and several church community centers planned and dreamed of during the depression years have now materialized also as in the past negro congregations have been buying the churches and synagogues abandoned by white congregations as they retreat in the face of negro settlement in new neighborhoods what was once bronzevilles most spectacular negro business policyhas been taken over by the mob policy shops no longer operate openly as negro businesses the jones brothers the gentlemen racketeeers who were described as race heroes in the first edition of black metropolis have now gone into legitimate business in mexico city they fled chicago after one of them was kidnapped by white racketeers and held for ransom the front man whom they left to look after their business in chicago was eventually gunned down on a street in bronzeville thus making the takeover of the once black syndicate complete while some successful negro policy operators still remain they are really only small fry and none of them exhibit social pretensions the policy racket lost its functional utility when prosperity came to bronzeville and its glamor when it ceased to be a negro controlled business few race leaders feel called upon to defend it now as they did during the depression change is most immediately evident in the physical setting within which community activities take place the black belt has grown enormously in size and thousands of negroes are now living in fine apartment buildings and in relatively new attractive homes vacated during the last ten years by white people who were getting ahead and who symbolized the fact by increasing the physical distance between themselves and negroes with money in the bank and gi and fha loans available bronzevilles home owners have been lavishing attention upon their newly acquired properties partly because of intrinsic satisfaction in so doing pride of possession and aso because it is part of the ritual of advancing the race they feel impelled to stamp out the stereotype that negroes always run neighborhoods down even the older parts of the black belt have a new look extensive slumclearance and rebuilding have changed the face of the black belts northern section while elbow grease paint and grass storm windows and flowers have eliminated much of the drab rundown depression look of yesteryears but unkempt neighborhoods and litterladen alleys and streets have by no means disappeared and bronzevilles masses are still piled up on top of each other in cramped quarters to a greater extent than in any other part of midwest metropolis to them the black ghetto has become a gilded ghetto but  a ghetto all the same the economic and ecological changes have inevitably affected what was referred to as the system of social classes in bronzeville although the basic pattern ville although the basic pattern has not been altered the departure of the gentlemen racketeers from the city and the tendency of members of what was described as the upper shady group to concentrate their investments in legitimate enterprises has been accompanied by the disappearance of an upperclass sector that was important during the depression years it might now be more accurate to define a center of orientation at the upperclass level called the unconventional uppers or the sporting set and to drop the term upper shadies the style of life of the upper respectables or the conventional uppers has not changed it has simply become more elaborate the same exclusive male clubs originally described in black metropolis set the tone of upperclass social life but the civic activity and social ritual of the upperclass and the activities of the greek letter fraternities and sororities are now functioning to weld together a new and larger upperclass stratum based upon a core of younger college graduates recruited from all social levelsthose who have made money during the period of prosperity and who want to live the upperclass style of fife not all of the successful professional men strive to become upperclass however some settle for a less expansive uppermiddleclass existence the upper and uppermiddle strata continue to supply leadership for the national association for the advancement of colored people the urban league the ymca the ywca provident hospital and a wide range of other civic organizations in bronzeville members of these strata too are beginning to appear in greater numbers upon the citywide boards of charitable and civic organizations thus linking bronzeville to influential sectors of the white community through membership in a variety of interracial organizations upon whose boards they serve at whose meetings they frequently speak and with whose members they now sustain to an increasing extent more intimate social participation but the major professional organizations do not yet welcome their negro counterparts as members and parallel structures to those organizations still exist in bronzeville the members of the upper stratum also continue to link bronzevilles elite to the negro elite in cities throughout the country by membership in national negro organizations and clubs and by frequent intervisiting the black proletariat divided into middleclass and lowerclass segments and sharing the fruits of the period of prosperity is even less inclined than in the past to think of itself as a part of some interracial workingclass in the marxian senseexcept during an occasional strike many of its members who however like their white counterparts belong to unions by checkoff if not by choice middleclass status now as in the past demands respectable public behavior relatively conventional family life and some concern for getting ahead the fact that recent migrants from the south are better educated than those of the past has probably augmented the size of bronzevilles middle class the world of the lower class is no longer neatly patterned in a physical sense as it was sixteen years ago slum clearance and urban redevelopment programs have wiped out the concentrated cluster of lowerclass institutions and scattered the population but as a subculture the world of the lower class still exists storefront churches flourish but illiterate and semiliterate individuals who feel that they are called to preach find it increasingly difficult to rent stores since rundown business streets are being eliminated by slum clearance and lowcost housing projects make no provision for such spiritual entrepreneurs there has been a substantial increase however in the number of conventional churches catering to lowerclass religious tastes the two large churches which were popular in these religious circles when black metropolis first appeared are still in existence but elder lucy is dead and when she passed her body was paraded through bronzevilles streets in state with coach and horses new churches appealing to recent immigrants from the south are now far more popular than either of these two churches still constitute a center of stability amid the constant flux and disorder of the world of the lower class bronzevilles upper class continues to worry about the negro image created among outsiders by lower class activities but they have had to resign themselves to what they consider the loud and unrepresentative radio programs for which the lower status churches easily find sponsors they are particularly concerned over the high degree of social disorganization which persists at the lowerclass level for the slicks the mr bens the baby chiles and their circle of associates are still prevalent how prevalent we really do not know but because their plight is so dramatic and their activities so unconventional they receive continuous publicity and thus help to fix an image in the popular mind within the disorganized segment of the lower class are the highly publicized unwed and deserted mothers some of whom draw a regular income from welfare sources as well  as the women and men who have formed loose and shifting commonlaw alliances the recalcitrant and sometimes violent school children the teenage gangsters the dope users and pushers and the small hard core of habitual criminals urban renewal tends to make the entire city more aware of bronzevilles lumpenproletariat for as the slums are cleared and the physical locus of the lower class is shattered individuals and families are forced to scatter into middleclass neighborhoods and onto the margins of these areas since public relocation housing has never kept pace with demolition enterprising realtors in middleclass neighborhoods are always ready to convert houses and apartment buildings in order to accommodate new tenants in crowded discomfort while the most marginal families huddle in dilapidated buildings awaiting demolition within clearance areas an occasional tragedy as when a firetrap burns or a baby is bitten by a rat excites a spate of excited newspaper comment and sometimes an expose the urban league refers to members of this group as chicagos dps bigger thomases as richard wright described them in native son keep on being bred and the frying pan is still useful against the rodents most of the people in midwest metropolis are now aware that all negroes are not that way but many people negro and white feel that too many of them are the middle classes insist upon increased police protection but realize that arrest and punishment solve no problems there is a general feeling that all social work efforts are merely holding operations until complete job equality and adequate housing provide a new physical and economic framework of existence and new incentives for young people out of which it is hoped new patterns of behavior will grow the lowerclass churches do not speak of the condition of the disorganized masses and very few brands are snatched from the burning despite continuous praying and singing preaching and revivals in recent years new black gods of the metropolis have appeared the leader and teacher the honorable elijah muhammad who was taught by the god whose proper name is allah has bought a synagogue near the university of chicago and converted it into mr muhammads temple no  with its affiliated university of islam here and through his newspaper and over the radio he exhorts the socalled negroes to repudiate the white mans religion to cast off the names inherited from slavery to eschew pork drinking smoking and gambling and to help build a nation in this wilderness of north america he encourages his followers to go into business but the attempts of the muslims to erect a business center in a new negro middleclass neighborhood created such vigorous opposition that the venture was blocked the moors    were operating in chicago as early as the s but it is only since the second world war that black muslims have attracted a substantial following the female faithful in their colorful pseudoarabic gowns and the fanatical males including the judotrained fruit of islam can fill the chicago stadium at nationwide conventions of the black muslims but the number of people in bronzeville who have actually joined the movement would hardly fill the auditoriums of the two largest baptist churches the rise of the black muslims is one index to the deep resentment among lowerclass negroes but is no more likely to have a significant impact upon bronzeville than did the communist party during the depression years neither the christian churches nor mr muhammad are able to influence that large segment of the lowerclass whose resentment is expressed in apathy cynicism and aggression and whose primary mode of escape is through having a good time it is the hope of most middleclass social workers and educators that as increasing numbers of migrants find regular employment as they settle inand as the educational level of bronzevilles population rises more and more people will adopt the middleclass way of life in addition to conventional family patterns this would involve widespread acceptance of church oriented and society oriented behavior the middleclass way of life thus takes on a degree of significance which justifies detailed consideration by sociologists it represents a realistic goal toward which younger people in the lowerclass can aspire it provides patterns which can be acquired without a great deal of selfdenial and with only a moderate amount of schooling a regular income is the main prerequisite it is a pattern which is attractive to the masses and which can motivate people to strive for it judged by intellectual standards it represents devotion to trivia judged by functional standards it provides stability amidst disorder consensus instead of anomie middleclass society is very much as it was sixteen years ago the same clubs which set the pattern when black metropolis was originally written are still going strong the kool kustomers dances are even more elaborate in this era of integration and they are sometimes held in loop hotels but scores of new clubs have also come into being some of them perhaps more popular than the amethyst girls and the kool kustomers the emergence of new clubs is sometimes mentioned in defender club notes in such announcements as a capacity crowd  frolicked with the dapper dans    when the clubs marked its first anniversary in clubdoms ranks or when it was stated that the contessas were busily preparing for their debut in a first annual dance fashion shows have become one of the most popular moneyraising activities throughout bronzeville prosperity has made possible an extreme elaboration of the cult of clothes which serves to integrate the world of society and the world of the church in upperclass and middleclass circles style shows and fashion revues are a fixture of the bronzeville subculture and no one sees anything incongruous about the guild of a catholic church sponsoring a pert and pretty fashion show or a baptist church presenting excelsiors in fashion review at its thirtythird anniversary services at the center of the cult of clothes is a group of amateur and professional models male and female some of whom are graduates of or students at charm and model schools the pace is still set by the group of women referred to in black metropolis as being the fashion setters sixteen years ago along with their younger admirers these women have connections with downtown department stores and some of them occasionally travel to paris in order to familiarize themselves with the latest styles these models move about bronzeville continually appearing at events sponsored by clubs and churches or giving their own revues despite the conspicuous consumption characteristic of bronzevilles people during the past decade considerable anxiety and apprehension exist beneath the surface for the bubble could burst as it once did in  also despite gains in living space the middle classes still have the problems posed by lorraine hansberry in her play a raisin in the sun uneasiness exists also over certain dilemmas presented by the era of integration all race leaders must express full commitment to the ultimate goal of complete and total integration but they find themselves involved in contradictions which result in inconsistencies of attitude and behavior there are problems and questions such as the following bronzevilles political power is based upon the existence of a segregated community what kind of political influence and rewards could negroes hope to expect if the black belt were to disappear some middleclass negroes are living in integrated communities the pressure of an overcrowded black belt is likely to transform such communities into sections of the black ghetto should negroes cooperate with whites in using various devices to maintain a realistic racial balance in these neighborhoods given the fact that their fellow black citizens need more housing should they help to keep the proportion of negro residents down in such areas the prosperity of negro business and professional men rests upon the existence of a black belt could they survive under conditions of general competition if the church is desegregated will mixed congregations ever accept negro ministers are there values and cultural products which have developed among negroes that will be lost if full integration ever becomes a reality such questions do not of course have the same urgency for those whose incomes do not depend upon the existence of a negro market or a negro electorate the negro masses for instance applaud the new race heroes on the white sox and cubs teams without giving a thought to the effect of this draining away of talent from the negro baseball leagues younger people too seem to be gaining a greater sense of confidence in their ability to face competition in an integrated america bronzevilles institutions keep alive the myth of salvation via negro business but the fact remains that despite the multiplication of small capitalists and the greater affluence of some large ones negroes have not broken into the industrial and commercial big time and the bulk of the negro markers money goes to white banks and loan companies the supermarkets the downtown department stores and to white insurance companiesnot to negro enterprises occasionally integrationist trends are viewed with alarm as a threat to negro business in midapril of  for instance the chicago negro chamber of commerce met to discuss how does integration affect negro business and the new crusader reported expressions of grave concern the negro masses on the whole have shown no inclination to sacrifice in order to build cooperatives nor to earmark a part of their income for supporting negro private ventures enough have shown racial loyalty however to support two very successful savings and loan companies and one cooperative store and credit union the goal of a selfcontained negro economy has always been considered a defensive measure and not an ideal solution to bronzevilles problems now some of bronzevilles capable and alert oldergeneration businessmen are talking of selling to the american market not just to the negro market and at least one is proving that it can be donehe has developed a cosmetics business which sells one line of goods to negroes and another to whites operating on a national scale his annual conventions of executives and salesmen are held at downtown chicago hotels and the defender refers not only to the lush setting but also to the fact that these conferences are an example of integration in action the competitive situation in this period of highly developed capitalism makes it very difficult for  negroes to enter business with sufficient capital and enough influential contacts to ensure a successful building up of impressive manufacturing or commercial concerns most negro businessmen find it much safer to invest in real estate or businesses within the negro community than to risk their capital in businesses oriented toward the general american market in recent years too there has been increased interest within the negro middle class in conventional stocks and bonds investments grumbling about jim crow is still one of bronzevilles major indoor sports taking the white man apart remains a routine conversational activity but fulltime fighting against discrimination and segregation is considered a specialist activitythe job for race leaders and race heroes for a certain kind of white person for job holders in the newer race relations organizations and for college kids who go freedom riding in the south or take a part in sitins and swimins in midwest metropolis everybody feels however that such people should be backed up raising money for freedom riders became a part of church ritual during the height of the movement just as campaigns for the scottsboro boys emmett tills defense fund or the montgomery bus boycotters had been in the past people also generally feel that they should contribute to the naacp and urban league even when they may not do so but for most people wearing their dark skin color is like living with a chronic disease one learns to take it and not to let it unduly cramp ones style of life and anodynes are always present religion the social ritual whiskey dopeand for those who can afford it an occasional trip to europe latin america or africa as a kind of play therapy from the black muslims point of view negroes should deliberately accept segregation they assert that negroes of all social classes are losing their selfrespect by pursuing an integrationist willothewisp the muslims continuously assail martin_luther_king the freedom riders the naacp and the urban league and call for the building of a black nation upon land to be secured from the government as compensation for back wages stolen during several centuries of slavery one member writes there are at least three things that we must do in order to lift the heel of satan ie the white man from our necks and that is to one separate our people from the caucasian race which means putting an end to integration second return the white mans religion of christianity which is the mental chain that is rusting and destroying our peoples minds and third we must come together this means dissolving our very foolish and false class system doctors professors lawyers college students mothers and fathers the young and old should take up the banner of islam and build a righteous nation on this earth most negroes reject the muslims racism and separatism while admiring their militancy and successful business enterprises during the s there has been a marked increase of interest in africa among the people of black metropolisa fascination with the rise of the new african states coupled with some resentment over the fact that special treatment is reserved for african diplomats so that they are less subject to discrimination at the upper and uppermiddleclass levels this interest is reflected in occasional parties for prominent african visitors in vacation trips to africa by the few who can afford it by investment in a few african business projects and by the frequent programming of lectures and discussions about africa before church groups and clubs at lower status levels there is considerable vicarious identification with leaders like jomo kenyatta and lumumba who symbolize violent assault upon the ramparts of white supremacy yet bronzeville rejects neogarveyism with its backtoafrica emphasis as decisively as it rejects mr muhammads nation in this wilderness identification with emergent africa while providing reinforcement for the sentiment of race pride is not diverting bronzevilles leadership from the primary goal of full integration into american life this blending of interest in the new africa with the american struggle for equality was reflected in the activities of those race leaders who in  were preparing for an exposition to celebrate the centennial of the emancipation proclamation their lobbying had secured financial support from both the federal and state governments most of the exhibits were to deal with the progress of the negro in america since slavery but considerable time and money was also being expended upon preparing an attractive display of our african background and of development in modern africa life in bronzeville is interesting often exciting and always meaningfulthough usually not in terms of values richard wright would have respected or admired yet like most intellectuals he underemphasized the extent to which a serious interest in art literature music and ideas has always existed side by side with the social ritual in the upper and uppermiddle classes the system is paying off and occasionally someone hits the jackpot opportunities and money are present for having a ball when people want to the mass culture provides a very wide range of satisfactions negrosparked race riots or mass demonstrations emigration to mother africa to the soviet motherland or to mr muhammads utopia have no appeal for they do not make sense in a period of prosperity and the era of integration and the big questions such as what of the bomb are seldom asked in bronzeville negroes in bronzeville are very much americans and this means too that if the masses are driven too far they are likely to fight back despite their sometimes seemingly indifferent reactions to discrimination and segregation a potential for future violence within black metropolis exists that should not and cannot be ignored 
the quiet leader
by bernard molohon
he year  marks t £ the anniversary of the p passing of one of the truy nee ro lead  ers of this century but because he shunned publicity during a lifetime devoted to bettering the lot of his people washington wire services gave his death only passing notice by the time those dispatches were published in the hinterlands most newspapers had cut the story to one paragraph the humble man who died of a heart attack at the age of  would have been very well satisfied with that because he was a government worker and those people are said to have a passion for anonymity he might have expected even less but i am one person who feels he deserved a large page one story dr ambrose caliver was the first negro ever to receive a permanent professional appointment to the united states civil service breaking this longtime insurmountable barrier alone could have tagged dr caliver for immortality among his people for his persistence not only opened those doors but helped pave the way for higher appointments of the ralph bunches and the robert weavers the latter to a full cabinet post if president kennedy had not been frustrated by a few narrow politicians however dr caliver was not satisfied merely to have broken down a colored berlin wall for years he quietly headed the negro education unit in the u s office of education working diligently to better the lot of his people in the one field which could truly make them equaland free and when he died he was chief of the adult education section of the u s office of education where he could help older people of all races who felt they had missed something in their youth or who eagerly wanted to go on learning among them he felt there was a high percentage of negroes because dr caliver wished that his many accomplishments be softpedaled he died barely known outside of american educational circles sad to relate millions of american negroes were hardly aware of his existence but his influence touched and will continue to affect the life of every negro in the united states for a long time and influence for generations many even beyond these shores  i first met dr caliver shortly after world war ii had broken out in europe he was then head of the negro education unit in the u s office of education and i was starting to gather material for my book voices of democracy since the iron boot of dictatorship was daily grinding down more areas of democracy america was determined to do everything possible to see that the torch of freedom was not entirely blotted out my little job was to put together a handbook for teachers speakers and writers showing what had been said and done over the centuries to further the cause of democracy one section was to consist of memorable stories of the long fight for freedom the other of quotations on all phases of freedom what was happening to minorities in europe probably blinded my thinking when i called on dr caliver for quotes and stories on the rights of minorities especially something from negro leaders since he was best acquainted with them the tall welldressed man thought a minute and then politely asked what other subheads i would have in my book i looked at my rough notes and read off some of the things i had in mind our inalienable rights liberty defending liberty giving up liberty power suffrage criticism freedom to know freedom of expression freedom of conscience free government free homes justice equality what we read and write truth thinking as we please    they were all just in the thinking stage but i felt most quotations would fall under those headings dr caliver made some notes and then told me he would have something for me in a few days he did but he personally brought it to my office rather than have his secretary call me and tell me the material was ready ive probably gone pretty far afield here and there he said rather apologetically but you can use what you want and throw out the rest for instance booker t washington spent his life trying to improve the mind of the negro but to my way of thinking one of his most memorable remarks was that no man should be ashamed to use his hands he stood in front of my desk as i glanced over the sheets he had handed me besides the pointed remark by booker t washington that the black man who cannot let love and sympathy go out to the white man is only half free and vice versa he included statements by such negro leaders as charles s johnson james weldon johnson william pickins and charles harris wesleyall caliver contemporaries but there was nothing by dr ambrose caliver when i reminded him of this he modestly said he had nothing worthy of being included after dr caliver left i realized that he had not confined himself to quotations by negro leaders on the narrow subject of minorities i remembered that i had suggested just that but without making a point of it dr caliver had included statements by negro leaders which would fit many other categories i could as he reminded me use them or not as i saw fit i wondered why i had been so warped my only excuse was that the pathetic state of minorities in europe screamed at me every day from the front pages of our newspapers certainly negroes had said things about other phases of freedom and liberty dr caliver also gave me leads to such stories as how john quincy adams broke the gag rule in the house of representatives with petitions signed by slaves and how james madison living in a slave state showed how he detested slaverywelcome additions to a section of the book carrying capsule stories of democracy  another thing bothered me after dr caliver left my office he had stood courteously at my desk while i overcome by the windfall of material he had brought me had been too absorbed or too impolite to ask him to sit down i mentioned this at lunch to a fellowworker in the office of education who had known dr caliver for a long time i know i should have invited him to sit down but wouldnt you think he would have anyway i asked no not dr caliver said my friend not until he gets to know you better for all he knows now you might be one of those birds who thinks hes superior to a negro so you were making him stand there on purpose what i was too surprised to say more sure and he wouldnt fight about it if you were one of those guys after all as long as he knows youre not any better than he is nothing else matters but a big guy like that    by big i meant that dr caliver with his string of college degrees really was a big man in educational circles in later months we had a good laugh together when i told him he was several degrees smarter than  was since i had missed getting my ba by three days but my friend thought i was referring to the fact that dr caliver was physically larger than i was well while he was standing there he was looking down on you wasnt he later when i got to know dr caliver better and found how easy it was to talk over such problems objectively i had it driven home again that trifles never bother a real big man no matter what his race the overall job of bettering the educational plight of the american negro was such a big undertaking that dr caliver could not waste time jousting with puny windmills human or material and today  when a dr ralph bunche says i both scorn and pity white bigots but i despise those who are black i can see that the influence of dr caliver has seeped down to the next generation just as dr caliver learned from his great hero booker t washington that love and sympathy are twoway streets knowing dr caliver better also gave me a new insight into his thinking and explained many of his actions i found that he in reaching his high state in civil service met with many problems similar to those encountered by benjamin o davis sr in becoming the first negro in u s history to receive a generals star but neither man seemed to resent the fact that to get such an appointment he probably had to be just a little better than the white man who attained the same grade instead both men appeared to welcome the gauntlet thrown down for them and were proud to pick it up in the end of course both confounded critics of the appointments    however at times in dr calivers career he felt as if he had run into a brick wall but instead of resenting it or getting violent about it he merely marked it down as experience refused to make the same mistake again backed up and made what he called an endrun around the wall he was quite adamant about violence im sure he was not a a pacifist but his attitude was that every time an agitator stirred negroes to violence they lost ground that had been gained by peaceful means and at the same time lost many potential friends he preferred to knock down enemies in a far more lasting and devastating manner somewhat in the way the man who was to become the catholic churchs first negro cardinal did a free north new jersey barber who refused to let him in his chair    with a shrug and the remark its all right  prayed for the man as dr caliver regarded such incidents the barber could quickly repair a broken window or even heal a split lip but he could never wipe out the scar left by such a perfect squelch and speaking of resentment i once asked dr caliver if it wasnt an affront to his race that a big part of the u s office of education was set aside as a negro unit when education in this country should be free and equal no i dont resent the idea at all negroes have special problems at least at this stage of the game and those problems can best be handled by people of their own race time will gravitate this unit out of existence of course but if the whites had learned that lesson early in their handling of the american indian maybe they wouldnt have had so much violence in finally settling the indian problem that made sense to me a pacific northwest native who had been reared a mile from an indian reservation    dont you get discouraged with the slowness of negro educational progress in this country i asked him not at all we havent done so badly in the few generations since the american negro was freed from slavery would you like to see some charts on how weve progressed from practically one hundred percent illiteracy in just a few short years i mean when compared to what the white man did in hundreds of years after he came to americaa free man i got the point however dr caliver went on there is just one thing a good many negroes havent learned yet from those white men even the ones who couldnt write their names many of those people came from countries where their station in life had been set for generations they came to america to get out of those ruts especially as they moved west one of the first things those illiterate pioneers did was build schools for their youngsters they were not too illiterate to realize that there would be jobs opening up in america for which their children couldnt qualify unless they were educated and they put forth a good deal of money and effort to solve their own educational problems i do not go along with any negro who spurns education because he thinks it is fruitless to prepare for a better job in america that was about as violent a remark as i ever heard from the lips of the man who in his humble way was trying to lead his race to a better life i am sure dr ambrose caliver would have been a success in any line of endeavor he chose with his unaffected dignity i often thought what a great doctor of medicine he could have become and how much money he could have made in that profession but he chose to get his doctorate in another field and to devote his life to helping all his people improve their lotat great personal and financial sacrifice to himself that is the mark of a true humanitarian and america lost one it could ill afford to lose when dr ambrose caliver died 
the negros escape from freedom
by dr nathan hare
recent years of study and observation of fellow negroes from coast to coast in america have made me ever aware of a strange paradox this is the unfortunate fact that the negro in our time is tenaciously engaged in a frantic escape from freedom the manner in which he makes his escape is somewhat curious and subtleif not sneakyyet unapparent to most owing in part to the complex sources from which it sprang indeed it has been a shocking study to me to analyze the motives for this pathetic situation i first became aware of it some years ago as i listened to the overworked cliche responses made to the question of negro disunity  apathy and the appalling sense of defeatism that is the plague of so many of them i noted that they invariably fell back on some convenient rationalization minimizing their own responsibility and group worth such as well you know we originated along the nile across from the euphrates before the dawn of civilization and the white europeans came and you know we were slaves for several centuries and you just cant expect etc    it was not long before i came to realize that in spite of the fact that the negros past experiences and enduring white abuse have inflicted formidable burdens on him negro intellectuals in their noble efforts to explain away and apologize for his current failures actually have contributed to the negros sense of defeatism and helplessness the resulting tendency is to refrain from what is thought to be futile action on his part as an individual this not only affects the negros conduct in the area of whitenegro relations in a number of amusing and interesting waysmore about that laterbut has tended as well to make him curiously more conservative in some respects than whites increasingly he has grown unwilling to differ from the general herdparticularly the white one thus he voluntarily enslaves himself without question or opposition to the white norms and standards which eric fromm the world famous psychoanalyst has diagnosed as representing collective neuroses let us take up these matters one by one to indicate specific ways in which the negro manages to escape from freedom while at the same time crying out that it is only being denied him it is apparent to begin with that the custom of apologizing for the negro has four main effects  increasingly allows the negro to give up his fate to the whims of the white world  magnifies the sense of white power and superiority  minimizes the negros own sense of responsibility for doing something about his situation himself including the forcing of white hands and  all of the foregoing contribute to the destruction of the negros selfrespect in both the individual and the collective sense undermine his selfsufficiency and destroy his general feeling of togetherness indeed a princeton university psychologist bertram p karon recently made an intensive study of the negro personality in which he concluded that some negroes now inwardly think of themselves and other negroes as just about as worthless as feces thus too many of them especially the middle class which should be setting a worthwhile model and contributing sound leadership  merely overidentify with the white world then frantically struggle to ape the same and to escape all traces of their negro identity see the black anglo saxons negro digest may  many seem pathetically unaware of the fact that they will always be coloredand never white once i conducted a survey of  negro college juniors and seniors in which a question asked was discuss the negros situation as you imagine it will be by  just  years from now mind you but i was amazed to note how many thought that the negro race will then be invisible or indistinguishable owing to the process of miscegenation thus these young leaders of tomorrow along with their highclass parents and peers flee desperately from their responsibility to the negro race and overconform to the trivialities of the white middle class yet being without recognition and true equality they experience a gnawing feeling of being left out of things and consequently pant after the signs and symbols of acceptance and participation too often excluded they affirm that they are not going to miss a thing and seldom do yet continue to feel that too much of the life they covet is passing them by many are the frenzied hours spent on spacious lawns and redecorated patios at getacquainted parties and gettogethers some take trips as far away as cairo egypt to get included in the act while touring abroad they frequently are able to feel  like a foreigner that is a nonnegro before jetting in to their waiting jobs those unable to take such trips even on paylater plans will sponsor make believe cruises in which they pretend to stop at such points as paris hawaii or sydney australia but almost never drop their imaginary anchors in a country inhabited by negroes or black folk at home again in the united states they frequently boast that they find more in common with whites even foreigners than with members of their own race and yet they are tormented by daily reminders of conscious differences this leads among other things to a sustained clamor for invitations to gatherings thrown by bored whites who use them in their quests for the thrill of the exotic and the forbidden and to satisfy their curiosity about the negro race to offset any feeling of similarity to lower class negroes on the other hand they label highclass residential sections for negroes gold coasts even though the nearest body of water may be miles away across town in integrated neighborhoods they may feel more perturbed than whites when they look up and see other negroes moving in in their group activities they constantly collect monies to rent swank ballrooms in downtown white hotels and night clubs in the effort to intensify their feeling of apartness from lower class negroes via scented invitations to formal balls and closed banquets there they proudly devour five course meals and boast that everyone was dressed for dinner after affairs not specifically devoted to eating are over the guests typically are feted at brunches sunday mornings after allnight drinking bouts and general barrelhousing then rush off at full speed and in solemnfaced piety to the front pews of their citys most elaborate church houses to show that all of the foregoing and especially the descriptions of negro behavior to follow represent an escape from freedom on their part let us first consider the validity of our general perspective this briefly is that man while influenced by things external to himself is not a slave to his circumstances past or present where lower animals rely on instinct and the nature of the habitat man is capable of resorting to strategy and reasonthough many do not indeed mans scientific name homo sapiens is translated thinking man although scientists also toyed with then discarded the label homo loguens or talking man which admittedly characterizes the majority of negro leaders but in a fundamental sense man is distinguished from other animals by his ability to think which is in the ideal sense an important aspect of talkingand is capable of choosing between two or more ideas or alternatives rejecting one or both history let alone the biographies of individuals is a testimony to mans ability to rise above the surface of his circumstances suggesting that whenever he does not he at least in part has himself to blame for man is able to cool deserts create warmth in icelands find water beneath the earth and fire and electricity in the clouds even if it could be said that the individual is one hundred per cent controlled by his circumstances it would be difficult to prove that the negro should be so more than others how long then can we continue to rationalize the negros escape from freedom and his all too frequent lack of gall yet this very thing continues at an accelerated speed with no promise of a letup indeed the pursuit of integration itself which began as a promising means to an end has contributed to this tendency in becoming an end in itself whereas other minority groups will insist on the right of their group to exist on an equal plane as distinct categories the negro prefers to liquidate the negro altogether as fast as possible thus integration is equated with acceptance by whites and mistakenly made synonymous with legal and objective equality the socioeconomic elevation of the negro as a group and the freedom of the individual indeed it often stands in the way of both negro uplift and ironically the achievement of the integrated goal itself the university of chicago political scientist prof james q wilson has pointed out in his book negro politics that negro voters for example are characterized by apathy and seldom take the trouble to vote even where they are not restrained this is due to a  sense of futility which also is responsible professor wilson found for the inability of the naacp to draw more than a handful of negroes to its mass meetings and freedom rallies and the necessity for overtaxing whites for contributions to make up for the failure of the negro community to come up to its quota at the same time the typical negro is prone to shell out his last penny to smiling white women collectors in exchange for some paper tag or emblem to wear on his coat lapel to signify that the chesty bearer has contributed to white charity professor wilson also was at a loss to explain the tendency of negroes to regard anything run by negroes as less than worthless and thus by refusing to patronize negro concerns help make their own evaluation turn out true this tendency to flee from organizations for negroes recently reached extreme proportions it seems to me when the president of a state branch of the naacp told his congregation of state con ventioners that the organization should not be called naacp the national association for the advancement of colored people but rather should be the naaap the national association for the advancement of all people apparently we may soon see the day when colored folk will be actively advancing  whites indeed this is not mere speculation when the national baptist convention the largest negro religious body met recently it voted a ten thousand dollar donation to rich roosevelt university a white institution forgetting all about the small colored colleges struggling in the south it is the considered opinions of some persons that colored folk are still too poor to show off like that another curious incident grew out of the negros efforts to gain white acceptance at all costs particularly by a conspicuous display of loyalty and similarity to the white race to the point of overconformity and superpatriotism this tendency is a point welldocumented by white behavioral scientists such as gunnar myrdal author of an american dilemma and the psychotherapists abram kardiner and lionel ovessey who wrote the classic study the mark of oppression as a matter of fact i have met negroes graduates of leading universities who argued in behalf of states rights one was even peeved because negroes are not allowed in the john birch society only recently i sat in an integrated gathering and listened to a negro gentleman proclaim that he didnt believe in all these overnight changes sometimes you end up worse off than you were before he then declared his conviction that rather we should go back to the customs we followed about two hundred years ago he seemed completely stunned when reminded that he himself would then be a slave fieldhand the negros cuperfrantic quest for sameness and social acceptance is even tightening the taboo against the negro individuals freedom to shun white company if he wants to when it is offered to him for fear of being accused of holding back integration at the same time they voluntarily submit in many cases to conditions of inferiority yet think that it is because they are forced to only i will never forget the way so many negroes in san diego california when i was there as a boy during world war ii used to slink to the back seats of buses in spite of the fact that they were free to ride anywhere years later in  i watched this same behavior in virginia after segregated seating rules were lifted on buses those i talked with said that they did not want to start no trouble or something to that effect i have often grown weakkneed and nauseated to see negroes cringing up to cubbyhole takeaway windows for their orders to go in the north i have watched full grown negroes calmly defy young children with pickets to enter places simply because im not going to walk way down yonder to that other store or hunh i got a charge account in there they let me have anything i want it is not hard to see that this tendency to place individual acceptance over group elevation which is a product in part of the negro individuals low regard for his own kind his desire to liquidate it and a depreciation therefore of his own sense of responsibility to it has a braking effect on the rise of the negro race in america it will take the negro far longer to acquire true freedom if he does not halt his frantic efforts to escape from it 
rude awakening
by terrezenia
like most fourteenyearold girls approaching the perplexing but wonderful age of fifteen am a dreamer dreams are good because you can escape the ugly things in life you can escape to a paradise all your own you can escape reality    for a while any way sooner or later you are captured and all of the things the ugly things you wish never existed hit you right in the face    hard thats what happened to me when i was running an errand for my mother one warm sunny afternoon in new jersey as i rode along the sidewalk on my bicycle everything was peaceful and quiet like it had always been in our interracial community suddenly a car speeding down the road broke the serenity i noticed it but continued to ride my bike when the car came to a screeching halt forcing the passengersa pale white man and probably his wife son and daughter forward then the man yelled to me hey i turned in his direction still riding my bike nigger he screamed his entire face turned red  an awful ugly red that i dont like to remember his words cut through me like a sharp knife i got off my bike to prevent myself from falling and stared at him in horrible disbelief saying nothing then he started up his car and continued his journey down the road that man must be crazy i thought risking his own life and everyone elses just to mock me about my brown skin momentarily i lost all faith in the caucasian race i didnt trust any of them i started to run home and tell my mother but then decided to go on to the store my two younger sisters would probably think i was chicken and i didnt want that to tell the truth i was chicken i was afraid to carry out my errand because i thought maybe he would come back and do something a lot worse than calling me a name maybe he would try to shoot me a lot of crazy thoughts ran through my head and for the first time in my life i was at a complete standstill and didnt know what to do or were the thoughts really so crazy hadnt i read in the newspapers and heard on the radio about poor unfortunate negroes in the south being shot beaten and having ks carved into their backs but this was the north it couldnt happen to me or could it i suppose these thoughts had really taken an effect on me because when a car pulled alongside the road occupied by white passengers and a man asked me very politely for directions to a nearby town i just stared at him wanting to run and wondered if the first man had really come back then i realized he hadnt because there were five people in this car and there had been only four in the  other one just keep going straight for about two miles i said dont make any turns and youll run right into it thanks the driver said i made a weak smile trying to act natural before i had a chance to remount my bicycle another car stopped occupied by a man woman and two childrena boy and girl the man asked for directions to a place where he could discard some rubbish he had previously passed a place where he could do just that about two hundred yards from where i was standing i jumped onto my bike and said pointing back there and rode up the street as fast as i could i looked back to see if the man was really going to dump some rubbish when the car passed by me as it did the people smiled at me it wasnt a friendly smile it was more like an imadeafooloutofyou smile or smirk i felt sorry for the two children of the man who mocked and ridiculed me it couldnt be too pleasant living with a father that found hatred in his heart so strong im glad that my parents never taught me to hate anyone especially because of something physical that could not be helped somehow im sure this man didnt try to ridicule me because of my skin color alone it has to be something else something much deeper than that maybe its because he and  other whites like him resent the great increase in negro progress after so many years of slavery after only fourteen years of life half spent in a segregated southern town in alabama and the other half spent in integrated northern communities in new jersey i really cant say that im much of an authority on the subject but i do know the difference between right and wrong ive been attending integrated classes since the third grade there have never been more than four negroes in my class for a couple of years i was the only colored student in my class at first i felt a little selfconscious and different and as if i didnt belong but the other pupils were so warmhearted and friendly that soon i felt like a member of the class i made many friends that i will never forget and the teachers were all very kind and understanding now that weve moved to los angeles i miss them very much often i think of the good times we had together on class projects and trips these students over fivesixths of them white never once called me a name relating to my race and color i invited the mayors niece along with other white and colored friends to some of my parties and we had a wonderful time we hardly ever discussed racial conflicts and problems arising in the south and i couldnt fully understand about the sitinners and freedom riders because i had not experienced what they were going through i couldnt understand why such a fuss was made over who rode in the front of the bus and who rode in the back and who ate at lunch counters and who couldnt and why colored and white children couldnt attend school together without riots and police i couldnt understand because i dont remember much of my first seven years spent in the south except that i attended a segregated school and lived in a segregated community in the beginning i resented the white man who mocked me but as i grow older this resentment turns to pity in this case he was my captor he was the one who awakened me from my dream and made me face things as they really are 
a letter to my nephew
by james baldwin
i have begun this letter five times and torn it up five times i keep seeing your face which is also the face of your father and my brother i have known both of you all your lives and have carried your daddy in my arms and on my shoulders kissed him and spanked him and watched him  learn to walk i dont know if you have known anybody from that far back if you have loved anybody that long first as an infant then as a child then as a man you gain a strange perspective on time and human pain and effort other people cannot see what i see whenever i look into your fathers face for behind your fathers face as it is today are all those other faces which were his let him laugh and i see a cellar your father does not remember and a house he does not remember and i hear in his present laughter his laughter as a child let him curse and i remember his falling down the cellar steps and howling and i remember with pain his tears which my hand or your grandmothers hand so easily wiped away but no ones hand can wioe away those tears he sheds invisibly today which one hears in his laughter and in his speech and in his songs i know what the world has done to my brother and how narrowly he has survived it and i know which is much worse and this is the crime of which i accuse my country and my countrymen and for which neither i nor time nor history will ever forgive them that they have destroyed and are destroying hundreds of thousands of lives and do not know it and do not want to know it one can be indeed one must strive to becometough and philosophical concerning destruction and death for this is what most of mankind has been best at since we have heard of war remember i said most of mankind but it is not permissible that the authors of devastation should also be innocent it is the innocence which constitutes the crime now my dear namesake these innocent and well meaning people your countrymen have caused you to be born under conditions not far removed from those described for us by charles dickens in the london of more than a hundred years ago i hear the chorus of the innocents screaming no this is not true how bitter you are but i am writing this letter to you to try to tell you something about how to handle them for most of them do not yet really know that you exist i know the conditions under which you were born for i was there your countrymen were not there and havent made it yet your grandmother was also there and no one has ever accused her of being bitter i suggest that the innocent check with her she isnt hard to find your countrymen dont know that she exists either though she has been working for them all their lives well you were born here you came something like fifteen years ago and though your father and mother and grandmother looking about the streets through which they were carrying you staring at the walls into which they brought you had every reason to be heavyhearted yet they were not for here you were big james named for me you were a big baby i was not here you were to be loved to be loved baby hard at once and forever to strengthen you against the loveless world remember that i know how black it looks today for you it looked black that day too yes we were trembling we have not stopped trembling yet but if we had not loved each other none of us would have survived and now you must survive because we love you and for the sake of your children and your childrens children this innocent country set you down in a ghetto in which in fact it intended that you should perish let me spell out precisely what i mean by that for the heart of the matter is here and the crux of my dispute with my country you were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason the limits to your ambition were thus expected to be settled you were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity and in as many ways as possible that you were a worthless human being you were not expected to aspire to excellence you were expected to make peace with mediocrity wherever you have turned james in your short time on this earth you have been told where you could go and what you could do and how you could do it where you could live and whom you could marry i know your countrymen do not agree with me here and i hear them saying you exaggerate they do not know harlem and i do so do you take no ones word for anything including mine but trust your experience know whence you came if you know whence you came there is really no limit to where you can go the details and symbols of your life have been deliberately constructed to make you believe what white people say about you please try to remember that what they believe as well as what they do and cause you to endure does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear please try to be clear dear james through the storm which  rages about your youthful head today about the reality which lies behind the words acceptance and integration there is no reason for you to try to become like white men and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you the really terrible thing old buddy is that you must accept them and i mean that very seriously you must accept them with love for these innocent people have no other hope they are in effect still trapped in a history which they do not understand and until they understand it they cannot be released from it they have had to believe for many years and for innumerable reasons that black men are inferior to white men many of them indeed know better but as you will discover people find it very difficult to act on what they know to act is to be committed and to be committed is to be in danger in this case the danger in the minds and hearts of most white americans is the loss of their identity try to imagine how you would feel if you woke up one morning to find the sun shivering and all the stars aflame you would be frightened because it is out of the order of nature any upheaval in the universe is terrifying because it so profoundly attacks ones sense of ones own reality well the black man has functioned in the white mans world as a fixed star as an immovable pillar and as he moves out of his place heaven and earth are shaken to their foundations you dont be afraid i said it was intended that you should perish in the ghetto perish by never being allowed to go beyond and behind the white mans definition by never being allowed to spell your proper name you have and many of us have defeated this intention and by a terrible law a terrible paradox those innocents who believed that your imprisonment made them safe are losing their grasp of reality but these men are your brothers your lost younger brothers and if the word integration means anything this is what it means that we with love shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it for this is your home my friend do not be driven from it great men have done great things here and will again and we can make america what america must become it will be hard james but you come from sturdy peasant stock men who picked cotton dammed rivers built railroads and in the teeth of the most terrifying odds achieved an unassailable and monumental dignity you come from a long line of great poets some of the greatest poets since homer one of them said the very time i thought i was lost my dungeon shook and my chains fell off you know and i know that the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred years too early we cannot be free until they are free god bless you james and godspeed your uncle james 
revolt and revenge
by john a morsell
week or so after a a violent black nationalist demonstration in the united nations in february  the new york times published two lengthy background articles dealing with this recurrent manifestation of negro discontent the reporters were able to identify and interview the leaders of some thirteen groups based in new york city and adhering in one way or another to racially selfassertive programs for negro americans these groups included besides the wellknown temple of islam the socalled black muslims such names as muslim brotherhood hostile to the black muslims united african nationalist movement universal african nationalist movement african nationalist pioneer movement united sons and daughters of africa liberation committee for africa cultural association for women of african heritage provisional committee for a free africa and so on solid information regarding the numbers of people involved is unobtainable the times reporters estimated that the total might be as low as  in the city itself at least half of them black muslims figures on the nationwide strength of these groups are even more elusive eric lincoln has made current a figure of  for the black muslims but he concedes that this guess is based on nothing that can be subjected to verification the significance of the black nationalist groups is not however simply a matter of their numbers as a matter of fact it derives in part from the very obscurity which surrounds the estimates of size as numerous observers have noted black nationalism is an extremist manifestation which rises out of deep and ancient fear and suspicion and which is nourished by contemporary frustration at the persistence of racial discrimination if even a relative handful is sufficiently impelled to active and personally satisfying participation and particularly if partial echoes of their arguments can be heard at nearly all levels of the negro community then there is some justification for thinking that the potential for espousal of black nationalist doctrines may be a good deal greater than the ascribable organizational base suggests it is important to understand that black nationalism is not a new phenomenon in organized form it reached its peak in the universal negro improvement association founded and led by marcus garvey just after world war i there may have been as many as  american negroes who enrolled as members or made contributions looking toward the establishment of an african state to be populated by black american emigres although the organization and its program failed to survive it is likely that fond memories have sent at least a few of its veterans into the presentday black nationalist camp in its african fatherland aspect even garveys movement was antedated in american history the colonization movement conducted and financed largely by proslavery elements in the decades prior to the civil war was the real forerunner despite its temporary appeal to some opponents of slavery it never flourished it was doomed by the neartotal lack of interest on the part of free negroes and by the eventual ascendency of abolitionism in the allegiance of those opposed to human bondage but the colonizationists must be reckoned the originators of back to africa it is equally important to understand something of the varied strains which have entered into black nationalism sometimes in combination sometimes indirectly and to see them in relation to the sustaining forces at work today i do not attempt here to develop a systematic analysis but am perforce content with what is largely an itemization in this should be included the rebellion against the sense of personal inferiority bred of generations of inferior status and fed by the constant exclusions disabilities and humiliations characteristic of the segregated society in which the basic orientations of most negroes are formed to escape some measure of this has been the good fortune of only a few but the urge to escape it is virtually universal many seek release in what is in all logic the most direct waynamely by creating an image of racial superiority in which the bruised personality can find solace parenthetically it may be noted i that the rallying cry for todays f  black nationalism is africa and the j african heritage and there is obviously an element of contemporary accident hereie the rise of new black nations in the dark continent fixing on africa as the chief symbol of negro militancy is something of a paradox it really implies acceptance of the derogatory stereotype of the american negro as submissive and dependent the passive beneficiary of a freedom bestowed upon him peri sons genuinely free of this stereotype and adequately informed as to their history might well have chosen their heroes and heroines ii from the american negros too littleknown record of slave revolts escapes resistance to captors abolitionist crusading and valiant combat by tens of thousands in the revolutionary war the war of  and the civil war and they might have reflected too that africas new states won their independence not on the field of battle but by the relinquishing of sovereignty through negotiation and under the pressure of world opinion another strain of great importance in the nurture of black nationalism is the abandonment of hope that racial justice will or can be achieved in the united states through invocation of the established process of democratic government it was the belief that the negros quest for constitutional rights had no hope of success in his or the succeeding generation that led booker t washington to preach the doctrine of negro selfimprovement rather than negro rights the conviction that negroes can never expect full equality of citizenship with the white majorityindeed that no white people can sincerely advocate such equalityis basic to the creed of the black muslims and some of the other racist groups the selfimprovement doctrine has persisted and it has numerous adherents who do not by any stretch of the imagination belong in the black nationalist category it is essentially separatist nonetheless drawing upon the seemingly unquenchable appeal of an economically selfsufficient negro community owning its own businesses and industries and in the perennial phraseology of its advocates keeping the money in our own neighborhoods it rests heavily upon the assumption that once negroes as a group have acquired their proportionate share of the nations wealth they will move as a matter of course into political and social acceptance its most common overt manifestation aside from the endless spinning of schemes for the raising of millions of dollars among negroes for investment in grandiose business proposals is the buy black movement the reference here is of course to economic selfimprovement preached as a doctrine of racial salvation obviously there can be no question of the necessity for achievement by negroes in economic affairs as in other areas of life the itemization would not be complete without a passing reference to the communist partys advocacy for many years of a separate negro state as formulated in its policy of selfdetermination in the black belt although this policy was imposed upon the american party leadership during the twenties for rigid ideological reasons and was as remote as could be from any realistic evaluation it remained in the partys program until comparatively recently evidence of communist connections in any of the nationalist groups is thus far not established and some of them are explicit in their rejection of such links communists and russians are after all mostly white people but it is most unlikely that the thought of infiltration has not at least entered the minds of the party leaders besides the racial elements in black nationalist growth there are other kinds of contributing factors of most of these it can safely be said that they would constitute sources of frustration and discontent even if every kind of purely racial discrimination were wiped out tomorrow with almost no exception black nationalist activity is urban it is most vigorous in the largest cities squalid housing a narrow range of job possibilities because of poor training low family income and the cultural aridity typical of the demoralized slumshocked fringe component of the city population are a way of life from which black nationalism seems to many to promise salvation a dim view of authority particularly as embodied in the police resentment of the more fortunate in this case middleand upperclass negroes endemic dislike of landlords shopkeepers and bosses so often jews and in any case usually white all these help to fuel the fire and to focus its heat on specified targets the grievances themselves are genuine enough the police are frequently brutal other negroes are too often insensitive to the needs of the disadvantaged and exploitation is not unknown on the part of landlords shopkeepers and employers but for the very reason that these are class not racial grievances they cannot properly be top priority items in organizational programs which are committed to the struggle against racial wrongs such problems are thus not within direct reach of the organized efforts in which aggrieved negroes are accustomed to think of themselves as being actually or potentially involved on a personal basis if however these nonracial problems can be so represented as to seem part and parcel of the racial burden per se the black nationalists hope to accomplish two things first in the minds of their followers a remote impregnable complexity will be replaced by an apparently simple and direct line of attack second the established civil_rights efforts can be exploited as whipping boys for their failure to solve all the problems that happen to affect negroes in the case of the muslim groups there is finally the explicit element of religion in a fashion made familiar by the father divine movement spiritual regeneration becomes part of the arsenal and numerous claims are made of the movements achievements in reforming thieves drug addicts prostitutes and so on there is no reason to doubt that some of these claims at least are warranted in view of the tremendous egosatisfaction derived by many adherents from their muslim affiliation beyond the buy black appeal and other activities growing out of the selfimprovement philosophy little in the way of specified objec tives and their related programs s discernible for some there seems to be nothing beyond activity intended to buttress internal morale by endless review and denunciation of the spectrum of grievances all profess to be concerned with awakening american negroes to their true ethnic status and with inculcating pride in their racial origins some do what they can along this line through meetings literature and individual example and exhortation the purely cultural manifestations often include campaigning for wider or exclusive use of african themes and artifacts in decoration negro women are called upon to abandon the hairdresser and to substitute natural modes of wearing the hair in the african style or more accurately in one of the great variety of african styles a few of the groups concern themselves chiefly with activity in behalf of what they conceive to be the best interest of the african nations they seek to interpret african needs to the american public generally and to have united states diplomatic pressure exerted in behalf of the african states and in opposition to colonial rule many of them have enshrined as patron saint the late patrice lumumba who is depicted as a black hero singlehandedly opposing the imperialist machinations of the western countries and murdered conspiratorially at the behest of those nations the closest approach to formulation of an ultimate goalie one intended to be the final solution to racial discriminationis that of the black muslims they are committed to working for the cession by the united states government of a portion of the continental united states preferably on the southeastern seaboard for settlement by negroes who will establish there a nation of their own no program of any kind has ever been announced for bringing such an event to pass although on many occasions attempts have been made to obtain one from black muslim representatives at least one group it should be noted for the record has been identified with a genuinely violent program looking to the disruption of civil authority by force this is the first africa corps sometimes known as the rastafarians originating in jamaica west indies federation and with at least one unit in new york city death sentence was pronounced earlier this year on one of its leaders who had been convicted in jamaica of the murder of two british soldiers the rastafarians however are a lone exception to the rule of professions of peaceful intent by black nationalist groups some observers have inferred an ultimate black muslim commitment to violence on the theory that they must know that peaceful requests cannot acquire for them their black slice of united states territory it scarcely seems necessary however to insist that the black muslims face up to the logical consequences of their propaganda premises they are surely not unique in their readiness to employ arguments of great emotional appeal without regard to where implementation of the arguments should logically lead southern segregationists are an eminent case in point indeed much else of what we see in the world today suggests that our age is strangely characterized by the potent allure of calls to action actionalmost any action and to intense personal commitmentalmost any commitment so long as they are intense and personal and fill the individual with a sense of purposeful involvement the need for escape from the hard work of seeking out and studying the facts which only leads to the even harder task of serious thinking and planning has made the emotional jag highly alluring to thousands and tens of thousands of peoplein this country and elsewhere for example this partly explains the massive appeal of the radical right with its substitution of nameless and ubiquitous conspiracies to fluoridate our water and poison us to promote mental health and brainwash us to lead us hypnotized down the road from free inquiry to communism for evaluation and acceptance of the realities of our national position and of the rigorous programs needed to sustain it certain special responsibilities are obviously imposed upon all of us who are in the fight for racial justice and who want it conducted with intelligence and effectiveness as well as with passion we must face the fact that logic to the contrary notwithstanding sizeable segments of the community will continue to heed the call of false prophets and with properly disturbing implications we should anticipate the strong possibility that the followers of black nationalist messiahs may become explosively frustrated when they discover that what they have bought is not hope but illusion if we understand the need not only for making such diagnoses but for performing the necessary prophylactic and restorative functions we must of course go farther at the very minimum we must never cease to be possessed by a level of moral resentment and indignation at least as high as that of the misled victims an indignation directed not so much at the false prophets as at the conditions which permit them to flourish failing in this we will not deserve and cannot arouse the confidence and respect on which our chances of being helpful rest among other things this means that we should be as deeply moved by a restricted apartment or a racial job denial or a segregationstunted mind as we are by a freedom rideand that we should see to it that others achieve the same comprehension the fact is that there are hardly any priorities the evils we face are all of a piece and we have no choice but to take them on collectively and we have very little time

hate that word i was born in boston and educated at harvard business but when i was in the army i was stationed down south and heard too much of it going back to the base after a night in town wed see them riding in the back of the bus they had their own waiting rooms rest rooms restaurants theater entrances everything here in san francisco we treat our negroes just like we treat our orientals and were damned proud of it despite anything duane duganhes from dallas texas might say barb and i have been paying the terrific rent at miss barrets just so we could have the apartment next to the dugans because duane is magnins hottest young executive and through him i hope to get their account for colt sheppard and davis but when he used that word in the elevator day before yesterday i caught him right up a what you know i hate that word duane okay buddybuddy call it the shadowed livery of the burnished sun but i tell you that one moved in upstairs yesterday be reasonable duane the cheapest apartment in the place is one seventyfive a month and the number of them that could afford he was lugging a bunch of boxes into eightysix probably just delivering a tv set or something number eightysix is the eighth apartment on the sixth floor duane and i were on four as we stepped out of the elevator duane grabbed my arm how about you being reasonable buddybuddy you know damned well that the naacp has agents out all the time guys they pay to go around just trying to get refused rooms or apartments or drinks so they can cause trouble what do you want to do for christs sake go burn a cross on  his door i jerked my arm loose and went into the apartment duane might have blue eyes that can blaze like rockets and he might have played guard for smu and have forty pounds on me and he might even represent the magnin account but guys with his basic attitudes do more harm to this countrys prestige abroad than every nuclear device weve ever tested and i wasnt going to let him back me down barb wasnt home but it was a nice afternoon so i went to the back balcony and looked down at the pool it made me feel better just to see her below sunning herself with those long tanned thoroughbred legs and that honeygolden hair as pretty as a starlets hey lovely lady she looked up and waved and that wonderful smile that i always feel right down to my toes lit up her face her gesture made the slanting afternoon sun cast exciting shadows down the dip of her suit i was glad it was friday afternoon and wed be able to stay in bed late the next morning come on down the waters fine dont kid me ill bet you havent even gotten wet yet i have too i went down and in a breathless water fight made sure that she got wet after a quick plunge id gotten over my irritation with duane and had even forgotten about the negro who was supposed to have moved in the sun was still half an hour above the high redwood fence around the pool area so we stretched out sidebyside on the warm cement i was almost dozing when barb said honey has miss barret gotten herself a chauffeur or something huh then i grunted drowsily i dont know baby but the rent she charges she could afford a brace of em like russian wolf hounds and she could afford a brace of those too why an absolutely huge negro man bowed to me on the stairs today when i was coming back from the hairdressers she gave a wicked little wiggle that she never learned at bryn mawr unless it was during a certain football weekend at harvard and just before you got home i was sure i saw him again staring at me over the balcony of one of the sixthfloor apartments i was wide awake by then dont tell me youre going to start in on me too baby before colt sheppard and davis moved us out here last january i dont believe barb had seen a dozen negroes in her life i never took her slumming in harlem or even to the village during the two years we were in new york and where she comes from in connecticut you couldnt find enough negroes to field a basketball team but shes gotten this idea maybe from seeing gone with the wind too often as a kid that a negro in negro digest april  a white apartment house just must be a domestic im not starting in on you herbie i just said that i saw a negro upstairs today and that i wondered im sorry i snapped baby especially on a friday night when weve got a whole weekend ahead of us and im having sexual urges its just that duane dugan claimed in the elevator today that a negro has moved in upstairs youre kidding dugan isnt hes convinced of it not only that he swears this guy is an naacp agent but you know all southerners are paranoid on the subject of negroes in general and the naacp in particular by then barb was more excited than she was last christmas over the pearls ill have paid for next year so i had to tell her the whole conversation ill bet thats just who he is she exclaimed triumphantly when id finished ill bet hes just waiting for someone to start trouble and then hell bring a lawsuit and the naacp wouldnt get to first base working that way baby not in this apartment house not with miss barret if you think theres anything about con that old gal doesnt know look at our rent but she wouldnt let go of it so i finally said all right then wench of my heart tomorrow about noon when we get out of bed were going upstairs and ask her we had a wine and candlelight dinner and it was nearly noon before we got up to the landladys yesterday as wed known she would she invited us in for cafe au lait and croissantsshe has a lot of oldworld ideas she once said that the bone structure of barbs face indicated true breedingand i opened up our subject casually with the cream and sugar say i hear that weve gotten some new tenants in eightysix miss barret is of indeterminate age stocky and grey and she wears clothes that are truly stylish and is the only woman ive ever met who can use a cigarette holder with elegance she was educated in france and once told us that at a parisian garden partythis was before world war iishe informed charles de gaulle that he had a very large nose and de gaulle responded gertrude it is not assez grand to interfere with my drinking which is all i care about with gallic gestures this always breaks barb up anyway when i asked miss barret about the new tenants her eyes lighted up and she exclaimed have you met them yet a charming couple not yet duane dugan said hed seen the husband in the hall she threw back her head and pealed out a ringing laugh something few women can do without  sounding like a polly adler girl i imagine that mr dugan considering his geographical antecedents was disturbed to the point of trauma mr veli is a melanesian from the fiji islands now permanently attached to the staff of the british embassy here in san francisco but im afraid that a southerners unselective eye would see him only as a gardenvariety american negro barb glanced at me and said i guess duanes noun was more colloquial than that and some of the laughter left miss barrets eyes doubtless that is a word which i hope someday will be stricken from our language except as an historical curiosity but i fear the purgation will not occur in my lifetime nor perhaps even in yours we thanked her for the coffee and sweet rolls and got out the porsche for a drive across the golden gate to sausalito and made it back in time for an afternoon dip we didnt see either duane or the new tenants at the pool but miss barret had made us both awfully curious as we were dripping our way up the back stairs toward our apartment barb showed a flaw in her liberal education honey im a little hazy about the exact location of the fiji islands youre asking me i was five years too young for the war in the pacific but i remember reading in holiday that the fijis were close enough to tonga for trading and occasional intermarriage and i know from cinerama south seas that the tongans are lightskinned polynesians i suppose this ratu veli is a little more suntanned than average and that duanes texas imagination did the rest mmf that was all i got until we were in the apartment and towelling off in time to offenbach and then she said as if there hadnt been a break in the conversation you can say dark polynesian but i saw our mr veli in the hall yesterday you didnt and im not convinced her eyes were sparkling as they do when she gets a deliciously naughty idea shall we beard the lion in his den black lions miss smartypants arent really black im not going to get any peace until youre satisfied am i no she said complacently so after dinnerthis was last eveningwe went up their name was in the slot beside the door mr and mrs ratu veli oxen ab i wasnt sure theyd be home on a saturday night but veli answered as soon as i pushed the buzzer and barb never finished what shed started to say when the door opened we were staring at that mans pectoral muscles i am fiveeleven a tennis  and my eyes were just chest level on him he was not only tall with a tremendous knot of kinky hair all over his black skull he was broad enough to have to go through doors sideways and since wed caught him wearing just a decorated cloth wraparounda sulu i read in holidayand a white shirt open to the waist i knew there was no fat on him his feet were bare each foot was as long and as broad as a ream of legal paper but their pigment in fact his overall hue was right out of the lamp shade i    my name is herbert benson i got it out somehow even though my voice was strange in my own ears this is my wife barbara we live downstairs and we thought    thought wed visit    thought    good neighbors    barb was having the same trouble with her voice that i was he was so damned big and black his eyes which were soft as a does looked pleased and he stuck out a hand the size of a squash racket delighted im ratu veli his voice was beautifully modulated and incongruously british just astounding from that enormous frame he turned towards the kitchen called mother put on the tea cosy visitors and then swung back towards us and went on wonderfully decent of you chaps to pop in this way his wife called from the kitchen that shed be half a second her hands were full of cookie dough and i shot a look at barb to see if she remembered our joke about the lion because veli moved with the sinuous grace of a black_panther and saw by her face that she did i surprised another expression there too something i hadnt expected well that was the damnedest half hour ive ever spent watching barb drinking tea and eating english muffins with marmalade and showing no slightest revulsion i was so proud of her that i could have hugged her we chatted right along with them and turned down their invitations to the ballet and the little theater and a soccer game at balboa stadium in the park without being obvious about it at all we learned that veli is eight years older than i am was a noncom in the fijian scouts during world war iihe said it as though i should know what they were that the oxen ab stands for what i thought it did and that he holds the victoria cross his wife brought that up but not as if she were showing him off he sounded like a bright guy but wed learned all we had to know when his woman walked through the kitchen door my jaw muscles are still stiff from holding that awful frozen grin in place we went all the way down to our apartment and were actually inside before barb let out her breath in a big whoosh you too i asked me too were young moderns as the ladies magazines put it and im as liberal as the next girl but      i dont have to repeat it all she was talking from a sort of shock and women especially american women who have had a lifetime of leisure to perfect the art can attack a female they find offensive in really vicious terms but last night i agreed with barb all the way i went halfway through the yellow pages before i found a mover who was open on sunday and i agreed to his price without haggling when i turned in the keys this morning i sure got straightened out about miss barret and her phony culture i started to say that id been recalled by phone to the head office in new york but she cut me off short i take it that in a spirit of daring and gay adventure you visited mr veli and his wife last night and his wife yes maam she had me stammering already but that has nothing to do  i mean this transfer is sudden and she burst out you disappoint terribly mr benson your wife knows of this fully knows and approves yes maam i mean of course shes going with me i wouldnt be transferred without my wife and    pleasespare my intelligence mr benson you may consider the week before your rent is due as sufficient notice of vacating then she took the keys from my hand and started to close the door and then opened it again and said something to me in frenchcalled me something i thinkthat i bet she didnt learn at any garden party with charlie de gaulle it made me a little sore that she wouldnt believe my explanation about why were moving tomorrow ill put in a change of address at the post office so she wont have the satisfaction of knowing that were still here in town twenty minutes ago i dug duane dugan out of bed to tell him that i was moving and to give him the name of the hotel where well be until we find a new apartment i hated to ruin his sunday morning but because of the magnin account i dont want to lose touch he answered the door barefoot and in pajamas his curly brown hair rumpled and listened to what i had to say you give us southerners a lot of heat about civil_rights but now you see what its gotten you fifty years ago one of them living like that right out in the open wed have lynched him in texas now theres nothing either of us can do buddybuddy im sure as hell not going to let him chase me out of my apartment i didnt say any more southerners are the ones who are supposed to have the intense personal pride and it wasnt his wife who was down by the swimming pool as i said ive always been for a good full life for our negroes and i always will be but i also spent two years as an enlisted man in the army and we had three of them in my barracks uneducated arrogant touchy about their color and i know all about how these people think call him a melanesian or any other euphemism you want when i see a black man living with a white woman with blonde hair and blue eyes and a peachesandcream skin and a british accent and when i see in my wifes eyes along with the disgust something she would never admit even to herself then im moving out from caution not prejudice because this ratu veli has what every black man who ever lived hungers after and the british accent and the degree from some overrated european university and the phony war medal wont make any difference his race has only evolved so far hes seen barb in a tight swimming suit and eventually hed go for her thats why its just common sense for me to move out of miss barrets thats why though i utterly loathe the thinking that inspires that word the southerners use i dont want the one in apartment eightysix living upstairs from me not when im away at the office all day not when my wife is home alone not after ive seen that expression in her eyes when she looks at him

there are all kinds of reasons for hailing and then we heard the thunder knopf  john o killens new novel about negro gis in world war ii in the first place the novel is some  years overdue there have been innumerable novels good and badby white writers telling the awful story of that awful war from their vantage point norman mailer that sensitive artist who sometimes now seems to be stumbling dangerously toward derangement first exploded into literary life with his own tale of trial by fire the naked and the dead john horne burns a finer and even more sensitive artist if that is possible dewhites understood negroes the frustration of educated solly saunders in his efforts to advance on merit alone in an army which judged him first as a negro and the cruel irony of men facing danger and death to destroy the twinheaded monster of fascism and racism abroad when that same monster held them prisoner at home and then we heard the thunder is not merely a protest novel as many critics are sure to term it it is a rich complex and believable story of men swept up in a stream of events both historic and violent from the reception center in new jersey to the training center in georgia and on to the pacific battlegrounds the novel moves with vitality and conviction 
what happened to the negros religion 
by the rev mr james f campbell
n recent years the american negro has  made great progress in civil_rights job opportunities housing and even in politics yet there is very definitely a decline in his interest and participation in religion statistics point out that more people are going to church in america today than ever before but of course this statistic is proportional and this is why it is easily refuted when referred to the negro yes there has been a population increase among negroes but at the same time the negros attendance at church and his religious enthusiasm has not kept pace with this increase at one point in the negros life religion was foremost all of his activities were centered around his religion and his church his religion gave him a sense of pride and dignity and even in his sins he felt an obligation to think and act religiously he possessed a deep consciousness of religion inwardly he believed that the things he hoped for and sought would come to him by way of his religion it may easily be said that the negro of yesteryear could be compared favorably with the jew who has always believed that god is first in life and from him comes the benefits of life there was a keen awareness of god in the negros life and his heart was rich with religious vigor but this is not true today from all indications there is a definite lag in the negros religious interests there seems to be a shyness among negroes when confronted with religion it is appalling to note the coolness that is shown throughout the nation toward the church and its activities in years gone by sunday meant going to church for the great majority of negroes and even though the statistics say america has more churchgoers today than ever before this is not true of the negro there is a drastic decline in the attendance of public worship no longer is sunday a big day for going to church todays negro would just as soon go bowling or spend the day at the beach why this is hard to figure i talked with a negro who has a top job with a science foundation his job is to travel around the nation and secure capable high school students who are interested in careers in science he told me that years ago he never failed to go to church whether he was home or away but now he says i almost never go when i asked him why he said he didnt know for one thing the problem cannot be blamed on poor leadership and church activities negro churches today have better trained ministers than ever before and they have good programs too if many of our ancestors could be restored to life again and were permitted to attend their former churches most of them would think they were in college thats just how much progress has been made in negro church life of course there is the danger of overprogramming but we cannot accuse the church of not having a problem perhaps the problem can to a degree be attributed to the negros liberation from poverty and fear the present day negro has a good income and he no longer has fear of being rejected because he knows the courts are on his side already a great number of his prayers have been answered maybe we are characteristic of the people of the old testament who after receiving deliverance from god forsook him about church attendance dont mention night worship service except for metropolitan areas with large churches and many hundreds to draw from you can almost count the number of negro churches that have sunday night services it is almost a thing of the past i will admit that there are some exceptions even in small places yet by contrast far more of the white churches proportionately are having night services i really feel that the negro has let the white man surpass him in the one thing that he alone possessed namely the integrity of religious practices why has this come about this is still hard to figure but perhaps the negros rise to social prominence has made its toll along with the negros rise in jobs and housing he has also found new meaning as a social being he has come about this with pointed interest and enthusiasm and in the process has seemingly overrun one of the most important aspects of life rather than spend his sunday evenings in church he is spending them in the homes of his friends and other places of entertainment sad as it may seem many negroes have taken an attitude of indifference toward religion it is practically an attitude of rebellion they simply dont care to be associated with any religious group there used to be a time when the negro was easily led to believe in god you could tell him that if he did not seek to live a godly life he would go to hell and this was frightening to him so consequently he sought to live daily by religious laws and beliefs but today with the great boom of liberalism and radicalism this kind of reasoning seems like folly to the negro he is far more objec tive than ever before and today he does a good job of matching an idea or a philosophy of life when you tell him something you may have to prove it he even feels quite capable of questioning divine existence years ago this was almost unheard of in the negro society except on college campuses but today this is done on a large scale freedom of belief is a great democratic ideal yet it can be very detrimental if it does not have its limits too many negroes have undoubtedly become obsessed with the idea of achieving and in so doing have denied themselves any growth and nurture from the supreme being integration has played its role too if we had the power to turn back the clock of integration we would not because integration has answered many of our hopes and aspirations but on the other hand i it too has made an apparent contri i bution to the declining religious life i of the american negro many ne i groes resent the fact that for a long i time the negro has been stigma i tized as a religionist in his quest i for integration he would like to be i accepted without being prejudged i in order to avoid this the negro i would rather appear irreligious or i even sacrilegious this seems to i be just how important total accept i ance would be to some people i any reason i have given for this i lag is not excusable in the final an i alysis this has to mean the negro has lost and abused a great privilege and a valuable asset granted all men religion when used understood and practiced wholesomely never fails to assist in making a better mankind it is something to be proud of and to improve it has been said that many times we condemn the things we passionately admire but far too often we deny ourselves of the things we really need and eventually we will discover that these things cant be done without 
wait till next year
by howard n meyer
readers who y are old enough to remember the baseball  era before jackie » j robinson joined the brooklyn dodgers will recall the chant that sports writers used to attribute to the local aficionados as their team finished out of the running wait till next year was the cry and even as it was uttered there was a mutual unacknowledged understanding that next year would never come during the days of my youth it never did school desegregation seems to be as hopelessly stalled today as the brooklyn baseball team ever was for over two and a half million negro children those living in the states of the former confederacy it seems that next year will never comeunless there is a drastic change in the temper of our people followed by a similar change in the conduct of our government we have just experienced the ninth september schoolopening since the supreme court affirmed the principle that racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional eight and a half years have passed since the court ruled unanimously that all provisions of federal state or local law requiring or permitting such discrimination must yield to this principle what did the ninth september produce in reviewing the first weeks developments u s attorney general kennedy commented that this was the second consecutive year in which every public school system being desegregated for the first time made this important transition without public disorder but one needs only to study the statistics to see that very little occurred except in new orleans parochial schools that would cause a segregationist to take the trouble to be disorderly the plain simple and unvarnished truth is that the united states constitution has been nullified in eleven states with only a few exceptions and token ones at that in large urban centers on the seventh anniversary of the court desegregation decision united press international described the period that had passed as the seven lean years and noted that the overall gain in terms of negro pupils in desegregated classes stood at a meager  per cent the year and a half that have since elapsed give no promise that the lean years will be followed by seven fat ones the socalled regional overall average as given by the admirably objective southern education reporting service will probably remain under  per cent after this years returns are in unfortunately the regional average bad as it is analyzes out to a gross overstatement of what has been really achieved the  per cent figure is obtained by lumping together the socalled border states which remained loyal during the civil war with oklahoma and the district of columbia and tabulating with them the exconfederate states if  the latter are taken separately as a group the following picture emerges using sers figures of the more than  negro  children of school age in those eleven states a gross total of  were in school with white children by may of  and if we exclude texas whose western region accounts for most of that states  contribution to the  we have ten states with a total of almost two and one half million negro school age children of whom under three thousand are in school with whites another tiny sprinkling was admitted this september whatever the final total the essential picture will remain the same another way of looking at it is from the point of view of the school board there are  such groups of local public officials in the eleven states in question each sworn to uphold law and order and presumably the u s constitution only  of these school boards have taken any steps toward desegregation it would seem that something must be lacking in our methods of securing compliance with law if the results to date are so disheartening there was published last year a careful and useful study of the performance of the united states district court judges in school desegregation cases in the southern states about the most serious error in the book is its title  lonely men that would seem to convey the impression that it is a study of fiftyeight heroic judicial figures standing firm as isolated bastions of constitutional right not quite while there have been and continue to be notable exceptions such as skelly wright of new orleans who was promoted but because of senatorial resistance to a post in washington d cthe average district court judge has not been a lonely pillar of justice in school segregation cases the author of  lonely men professor j w peltason of the university of illinois would be the first to agree that nothing could be further from the truth than this idealized picture he has studied the more than two hundred lawsuits launched over a sevenyear period in the effort to compel obedience to the requirements of the constitution at the local school board level his conclusions by and large federal judges applied the law adversely to the claims of negroes the refusal of some of the district judges to clamp down on recalcitrant boards has had a cumulatively adverse impact on the other judges the supreme court has declared public school segregation unconstitutional but many southern federal district judges had permitted the evasion of the consequences of those decisions  the judges have approved programs that will keep most negroes in segregated institutions until long beyond the time when even those now starting first grade will have graduated in his book prof peltason tells us with keen insight into the nature of the judicial process just why that process cannot succeed in reforming the offending school systerns some of the obstacles encountered were inevitable builtin as it were in judicial procedure others not so foreordained nevertheless have been erected and made a rocky road wellnigh impassable there has been for example the fact that the district judge is very much a part of the life of the south the author might have been more precise and said the white south and hence reluctant even when seeking to apply the law as laid down by higher courts to take action that will arouse hostility in the community of which he is a part the effect is sometimes not easily pinpointed but there are so many ways in which by delay in holding hearings by upholding technical objections by making the path of the suitor harder in one way or another the judge can deny justice unanticipated and gave difficulties were created by the march  manifesto of the ninetysix congressmen from the south who promised their constituencies to use all lawful means to resist the enforcement of law by dignifying the posture of defiance and contributing to the illusion that the supreme courts unanimous interpretation might somehow be set aside they gave the segregationists a major breakthrough school boards took due notice and the judges in the federal courts were faced with an additional inhibition and a further source of actively hostile community sentiment  shortly after the little rock episode as we need to be reminded the rumor spread in washington that president eisenhower had said privately that he wished the supreme court had never ruled against segregation and had also said that he felt the southern communities should proceed more slowly confronted at a press conference with this rumor the president declared in his deathless prose i might have said something about slower but i do believe that we shouldbecause i do say as i did yesterday or last week we have got to have reason and sense and education and a lot of other developments that go hand in hand as this processif this process is going to have any real acceptance in the united states the presidents statement was hardly calculated to encourage a lonely federal judge to stand up to the segregationists a reflection of such difficulties can be seen in the retreat of the courts when faced with the pupil placement or pupil assignment laws devised in some of the resisting states to create additional obstacles to those who would take steps to vindicate their childrens constitutional rights in court these are probably the greatest and most enduring of all the obstacles to school desegregation erected during the seven lean years just past and it is a fair statement that until they are broken down the device of token desegregation will stall further progress  some twenty years ago an eminent sociologist an associate of gunnar myrdal wrote that the american south is the only place in the world today where one can get a reputation for being a liberal simply by urging obedience to law and where conservatives regularly violate the law true as this statement remains today it needs to be elaborated by the addition of another aspect one can get a reputation as a moderate by urging the community to pretend to obey the law by token compliance what of the future the kennedy administration which has in many ways lived up to its campaign pledges to act against discrimination on every front has not changed significantly the course of events spotlighted in  lonely men it was not long after his induction that the new attorney general speaking in georgia forthrightly declared that if the orders of the court are circumvented the department of justice will act we will not stand by or be aloof we will move however the civil_rights crisis in the schools is not so much due to the circumvention of i existing court orders as it is to the i difficulty of securing meaningful i court orders and enough of them i it took two hundred lawsuits i each one privately financed to gain i the admission of the handful of stu i dents who have entered a few i schools not only must each law i suit be privately financed but in i each case a family or group of families must come forward separately in each school district and face the threat of economic reprisals or worse will we ever know the full story of what happened to the negro families whose children at first entered and then withdrew from the parochial school at buras to have a profound and revolutionary readjustment of race relations in the schools depend on privately financed lawsuits with volunteer plaintiffs is utterly unsatisfactory except as professor peltason points out to the segregationists negroes lack the political power to force school boards to integrate their only choice is to litigate and to persuade a judge to command the board to act segregationists do not fear this as long as the national government does not interfere there will obviously be no change in the school situation until there is new legislation there have been plenty of proposals but the kennedy administration has not as yet seen fit to identify itself with any one of them or put forward any of its own presumably the administration has refrained from asking for new legislation in respect to school desegregation either because of a fear of adverse effect on the balance of the legislative program or because of lack of prospect of passage yet it is hard to see how the presidents program could have fared much worse as to lack of prospect of passage it would seem that if the administration were to have brought the facts to the people there might have been a reaction strong enough to get some sort of legislation the eisenhower administration produced civil_rights laws on the subject of voting that while far from perfect or complete have given attorney general kennedy and his civil_rights chief burke marshall tools to move in on the grosser instances of disenfranchisement early in the kennedy administration the congress gave the president an unusual chance to eliminate roadblocks in civil_rights litigation but the opportunity was not seized upon there had developed in the last years of the eisenhower administration a great need for additional federal judgeships throughout the united states to meet the problem of overloaded dockets and court congestion on may   the omnibus judgeship bill was passed creating seventythree new federal court posts of these twentynine vacancies were to be filled in states with recurrent civil_rights problems unfortunately as walter dean burnham recently wrote in these pages no president is strong enough to have his way against the entrenched custom of senatorial courtesy the practical significance of that powerful political tradition is that judges appointed by a democratic president are really nominated by segregationist senators consider in this connection the number one appointment made by president kennedy under the omnibus judgeship bill that of william harold cox an associate of senator eastland it seems according to another of our national traditions that when a presidential appointee is acceptable to both of the senators from the state where he resides the rest of the senate liberal or conservative follows a courtesy practice or hands off rule when mr cox was nominated to the federal bench for the district of mississippi there was merely a pro forma hearing and no objection was raised to the nomination compare the ordeal of thurgood marshall judge coxbellwether of the appointments under the omnibus billdid not lose much time in ? making clear where he stood on the issues that would come before him a federal civil_rights statute of long standing has provided that a state criminal prosecution wherein civil_rights are involved may be transferred to the local federal court in order to assure protection of those rights counsel for a group of the freedom riders sought to so transfer their clients cases the move was rejected by judge cox decisions on such transfer removal cases are nonappealable so that we shall never know whether he was right or wrong in a technical sense but in his decision judge cox gave expression to selfrevealing dicta and characterizations the riders he declared judically came from other states for provocative  purposes their destination was jackson but their objective was trouble this court may not be regarded as any haven for any such counterfeit citizens from other states deliberately seeking to cause trouble here among its people what provoked judge coxs denunciation was the quiet entry of whites and negroes into socalled white waiting rooms and lunch counters in interstate travel facilities unfortunately judge cox has not been the only judicial appointee foisted on the president by a democratic state organizationand approved let it be added by the american bar associationwho proved to be an embarrassment and a fierce foe of certain constitutional requirements frank ellis of the ellenderlong organization who was appointed to succeed j skelly wright in new orleans hardly waited until the latter got on the train to leave the state before voiding his desegregation orders which were later only partially reinstated by an appellate court more recent and dramatic was the performance of talmadge henchman j robert elliott of georgia who unashamedly issued without a hearing an injunction against the peaceful protest activities of the albany movement shortly afterwards there was administered the rebuke of summary revocation of his order by an appellate judge but that has not deterred judge elliott from continuing to dispense his own brand of justice these are extreme cases it would be wrong to imply that the average southern federal judge takes his oath of office with mental reservation or purpose of evasion as to the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments but the bulk of the recent appointees give no promise of departing from the pattern of conduct of the roosevelttrumaneisenhower appointees whose performance is studied and found wanting in  lonely men the lesson to be derived from all this is that the federal district courts by reason of the character and origin of their personnel and limitations of the lawsuitbylawsuit method are not qualified to continue to preside over so farreaching a reform as the change in the practices of three thousand different local school boards this major social problem calls for the functioning of a single national administrative agency equipped with investigative and enforcement powers very much like those of the federal trade commission or the national labor relations board such an agency could act with speed flexibility that would enable it to cope with evasion and a forcefulness that will come from freedom from local roots and pressures it could devote itself to the singleminded pursuit of compliance with the constitution its orders to cease and desist could be enforced by the federal courts of appealwithout the intervention of a district judgeand the authority of the courts of appeal to review or revise such orders could be limited to the extremely narrow scope reserved for appeals from administrative agencies such a plan and agency would be beyond doubt constitutional section five of the fourteenth amendment expressly provides that congress shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article the right to bargain collectively is not endowed by the constitution it is merely a statutory right yet it is enforced by the effective method of administrative action why should there not be an administrative remedy for deprivation of such a constitutional right as access to an unsegregated school an agency of this nature being truly national in scope would be equipped and obliged to investigate intervene and act in the many situations at the north east and west that have been lumped together under the head of de facto segregation a national body can and should be out gunning for the northern discriminationist as well as the southern segregationist why should the underprivileged families of engel wood n j and mai verne l i los angeles and chicagoto name only a few where phases of this same problem have cropped up in various guiseshave to chip in from meager resources to pay the cost of expensive and longdrawnout litigation one should not of course be under any illusions any legislation let alone effective legislation to enforce the constitutional rights of american children will not be easy to pass it will require the development of a seething burning massive public demanda demand that is not yet in sight not until our collective conscience is aroused to action will our government respond but just as each citizen has an obligation to act to be heard from so too the president has an obligation to give us leadership when the american people are properly aroused no sectional veto or filibuster will stand in the way but as professor peltason says until those favoring school integration fight as hard for civil_rights as segregationists are fighting against them southern schools will remain segregated as long as the schools in any area remain segregated the really basic facts of race relations will remain the sameregardless of whether white lavatories at bus terminals are thrown open to all or whether the second secretary of the upper volta legation can get a meal on route  these are the surface the vitals of our difficulty are largely untouchedtotal segregation in most exconfederate areas and economic and residential discrimination throughout the nation voting rights are important but school segregation is the very heart of the issue it plays an overwhelming and selfperpetuating role as both the cause and the effect of prejudice charles sumner great massachusetts senator of a century ago who saw so much so far ahead of his time stated the issue over a decade before the civil war when he vainly sought to persuade the massachusetts court to desegregate the boston school system the worst aspect of segregated schools he said is that they tend to deepen and perpetuate the odious distinction of caste founded in a deeprooted prejudice in public opinion one of the most challenging statements i ever saw on this subject was the opening of an address by the rev raymond t bosler last year on the catholic hour we americans are an impatient people he said we are proud of the fact we want results and we want them right now we are impatient about everything under the sun except one thing and about this one thing we are extremely virtuous we are not only most patient we are most prudent about it    this is not the way americans ordinarily approach a problem this is untypical of america and when you come right down to it everything about the race problem is untypical  it doesnt fit into the american picture and that is why we ought to get rid of it right away it is time we approached the race problem in the typical american mannerwith impatience with a determination to get results immediate results what is holding us back 
the recovery of
by kwame nkrumah
istinguished scholars it is an honour and privilege for me to welcome you to ghana and to this first africanist conference your meeting here within the ramparts of an african university is a reflection of africas recovery and reawakening it is also a recognition of the new spirit which now animates the people of this great continent it is even edifying that this congress is taking place on african soil i know that you who have gathered here represent various fields and branches of learning in fact i see familiar faces of professors of universities and academies what has impelled you distinguished scholars to gather here at such a time as this you are here and are united by the fact that you want to find out the truth about africa and when you have found out to proclaim it to the world scholarly and academic interest in africa is not a new venture the desire to know more about africa has been expressed from the very earliest times because africa has been the questionmark of history to a roman proconsul semper aliquid novi ex africa from the imaginings of the ancient geographers an inaccurate and distorted picture of africa often emerged south of the atlas ranges a sandy desert was believed to extend indefinitely with here and there a providential oasis a rivulet which nibbling and corroding its way through the sandy wastes dripped into the sea even so the ancients had some genuine knowledge of the african continent for they had a scientific curiosity about it thus erastostheses and aristotle knew that the cranes migrated as far as the lakes where the nile had its source and both of them thought that it was there that the pygmies dwelt among the travellers of the ancient world who tried to explore africa we may recall men like strabo and hanno of carthage after these early travels foreign knowledge of africa became static until a new impetus was given to it by the arabs and the chinese the arabs and the chinese discovered and chronicled a succession of powerful african kingdoms one of these kingdoms was that of ghana the pomp of whose court was the admiration of that ageand also of ours it bred and developed within its borders the instruments of civilisation and art its palaces were of solid architectural construction complete with glass windows murals and sculpture and the thrones within the palaces were bedecked with gold there were other kingdoms such as those of shonghay sala berissa the renowned empires of bornu wangara melli the historians tell us that these empires and kingdoms were maintained with remarkable efficiency and administrative competence their splendour was proverbial in mediaeval times the chinese too during the tang dynasty ad  published their earliest major records of africa in the th century scholarship connected egypt with china but chinese acquaintance with africa was not confined to knowledge of egypt only they had detailed knowledge of somaliland madagascar and zanzibar and made extensive visits to other parts of africa the european exploration of africa reached its height in the th century what is unfortunate however is the fact that much of the discovery was given a subjective instead of an objective interpretation in the regeneration of learning which is taking place in our universities and in other institutions of higher learning we are treated as subjects and not objects they forget that we are a historic people responsible for our unique forms of language culture and society it is therefore proper and fitting that a congress of africanists should take place in africa and that the concept of africanism should desolve from and be animated by that congress between ancient times and the th century some european scholars forgot what their predecessors in african studies had known this amnesia this regrettable loss of interest in the power of the african mind deepened with growth of interest in the economic exploitation of africa it is no wonder that the portuguese were erroneously credited with having erected the stone fortress of mashonaland which even when barbossa cousin of magellan first visited them were ruins of long standing i have said that the pursuit of african studies is not a new experience but the motives which have led various scholars to undertake these studies have been diverse we can distinguish first a true scientific curiosity most of the persian greek and roman travelers exhibited this motive even when as in the case of the romans they had a primary military purpose they still tried and often succeeded in preserving some sense of objectivity arab explorers were also often unbiased in their accounts of africa and indeed we are grateful to them for much of what they wrote concerning our past by the time the early european writings on africa got underway a new motive had begun to inform african studies those early european works exchanged the scientific motive for one that was purely economic there was the unbalanced trade in ivory and gold and there was the illegitimate trafficking in men for which these writings needed to find some sort of excuse the point i wish to make at this stage is that much of european and american writing on africa was at that time apologetic it was devoted to an attempt to justify slavery and the continued exploitation of african labour and resources african studies in europe and america were thus at their lowest ebb scientifically with the abolition of the slave trade african studies could no longer be inspired by the economic motive the experts in african studies therefore changed the contents and direction of their writings they began to give accounts of african society which were used to justify colonialism as a duty of civilisation even the most flattering of these writings fell short of objectivity and truth this explains i believe the popularity and success of anthropology as the main segment of african studies the stage was then set for the economic and political subjugation of africa africa therefore was unable to look forward or backward the central myth in the mythology surrounding africa is that of the denial that we are a historical people it is said that whereas other continents have shaped history and determined its course africa has stood still held down by inertia africa it is said entered history only as a result of european contact its history therefore is widely felt to be an extension of european history hegels authority was lent to this ahistorical hypothesis concerning africa and apologists of colonialism and imperialism lost little time in seizing upon it and writing wildly about it to their hearts content to those who say that there is no documentary source for that period of african history which predates the european contact modern research has a crushing answer we know that we were not without a tradition of historiography and that this is so is now the verdict of true africanists african historians by the end of the th century had a tradition of recorded history and certainly by the time when mohamud alkati wrote tarikh alfattash this tradition was incidentally much much wider than that of the timbuktu school of historians and our own institute of african studies here at this university is bringing to light several chronicles relating to the history of northern ghana particularly those of alhajj usmanu of those chronicles the most exciting traced down to date appears to be the isnad alshuykh wa ilulama written around  by alhajj muhama ben mustafa who lived in western gonja it gives details of the conversion of the dynasty in  a great deal of interesting work has been done and continues to be done in learned centres in africa in nigeria for example dr dike has worked on politics and trade in the niger delta here he reflects like other africanist scholars a new africancentred approach to the study of the relations between the delta states and europe in the th century in this connection the collaboration of archaeologists historians and anthropologists studying different aspects of the history institutions and culture of precolonial africa has produced beneficial results a large collection of manuscripts and other evidence helping this adventure has now been made in many african centres of learning at the university of dakar for example i understand that a great deal has been collected in the way of documentary material relating to the history of the western sudan in mali also considerable work is being done on precolonial history and the museum at bamako has gathered a great deal of material both useful and fascinating in guinea too the story of the contact between europe and africa is being written as an african experience and not as a european adventure similar work is being successfully undertaken in the ivory coast in upper volta there is the important work of professor kizerbo on the moshi kingdom and he has for some months now been working happily and successfully in our institute of african studies as an expression of the cultural unity of africa in east africa a great deal of progressive work continues to be done documents and inscriptions in egez and amharic in swahili and arabic in old nubian and meroitic are being collected in order to make possible our authentic reinterpretation of our past in sudan in ethiopia in tanganyika in somalia kenya uganda everywhere in africa there is purposeful effort to bring to light those means which alone will enable us to present our history as the history of the african people the history of our actions and of the ideology and principles behind them the history of our sufferings and our triumphs this congress among other things is an attempt to share experience in this common endeavour many of these sources are documents and documents written in african languages are coming to light thus apart from hausa there are vast collections written in fufulde kanuri nupe dagbani these are mainly th century documents but they reflect a tradition of learning which goes back to the mediaeval times but our historical records do not consist alone in the facts which we committed in the arabic script every society has methods of preserving facts about its past and where a society has no literate traditions it devises rigorous methods of oral recording scholars who have studied this phenomenon know this well historical recording in africa therefore rightly comprises the documents in arabic and african languages on the one hand and on the other the wellpreserved and authentic records of oral tradition our inheritance of oral literature of epic and lyric poetry of stories and legends praise songs and the chronicles of states and dynasties preserved by palace officials is of intrinsic interest and merit as it is of historical importance the history of a nation is unfortunately too easily written as the history of its dominant class if the history of a nation of a people cannot be found in the history of a class how much less can the history of a continent be found in what is not even a part of iteurope and yet this is precisely what many a european historian has done in the past the history of africa has with them been european centred africa was only the space in which europe swelled up the african past was ignored or dismissed in these tendentious works as not contributing to or affecting the european expansion and presence in africa if africas history is interpreted in terms of the interests of european merchandise and capital missionaries and administrators it is no wonder that african nationalism is regarded as a perversion and colonialism as a virtue you who are meeting here today in the first congress of africanists are all representatives of various disciplines and are determined to pool your immense knowledge of africa for the progress of the african your efforts mark a renascence of scientific curiosity in the study of africa and should be directed at an objective impartial scrutiny and assessment of things african while some of us are engaged with the political unification of africa africanists everywhere must also help in building the spiritual and cultural foundations for the unity of our continent in east africa in the sudan in egypt in nigeria here in ghana and elsewhere the earth is being dug up apacethis time not for gold or diamonds only or for bauxite and other mineral riches but also for its rich information about our past its testimony to our achievements and its refutation of the sombre prophets of african history valuable pieces have already been unearthed including evidence of the origin of man in africa we have made our contribution to the fund of human knowledge by extending the frontiers of art culture and spiritual values democracy for instance has always been for us not a matter of a technique but more important than techniquea matter of socialist goals and aims it was however not only our socialist aims that were democratically inspired but also the methods of their pursuit were socialist if we have lost touch with what our forefathers discovered and knew this has been due to the system of education to which we were introduced this system of education prepared us for a subservient role to europe and things european it was directed at estranging us from our own cultures in order the more effectively to serve a new and alien interest in rediscovering and revitalising our cultural and spiritual heritage and values african studies must help to redirect this new endeavour the educational system which we devise today must equip us with the resources of a personality and a force strong enough to meet the intensities of the african presence and situation education must enable us to understand correctly the strains and stresses to which africa is subjected to appreciate objectively the changes taking place and enable us to contribute fully in a truly african spirit for the benefit of all african studies is not a kind of academic hermitage it has warm connections with similar studies in other countries of the world it should change its course from anthropology to sociology for it is the latter which more than any other aspect creates the firmest basis for social policy your meeting here today as africanists from various countries of the world is truly historic it emphasises the idea that knowledge transcends political and national boundaries it is incumbent upon all africanist scholars all over the world to work for a complete emancipation of the mind from all forms of domination control and enslavement    a great century has come upon us no race possessing the inherent capacity to survive can resist and remain unaffected by this influence of contact and intercourse the backward with the advanced this influence constitutes the very essence of efficient progress and of civilisation from these heights of the twentieth century i again ask you to cast your eyes south of the desert of sahara if you could go with me to the oppressed congos and ask what does it mean that now for liberty they fight like men and die like martyrs if you would go with me to bachuanaland face their council of headmen and ask what motives caused them recently to decree so emphatically that alcoholic drinks shall not enter their countryvisit their king khama ask for what cause he leaves the gold and ivory palace of his ancestors its mountain strongholds and all its august ceremony to wander daily from village to village through all his kingdom without a guard or any decoration of his ranka preacher of industry and education and an apostle of the new order of things if you would ask menelik what means this that abyssinia is now looking across the oceanoh if you could read the letters that come to us from zululandyou too would be convinced that the elevation of the african race is evidently a part of the new order of things that belongs to this new and powerful period the african already recognizes his anomalous position and desires a change the brighter day is rising upon africa already i seem to see her chains dissolved her desert plains red with harvest her abyssinia and her zululand the seats of science and religion reflecting the glory of the rising sun from the spires of their churches and universities her congo and her gambia whitened with commerce her crowded cities sending forth the hum of business and all her sons employed in advancing the victories of peacegreater and more abiding than the spoils of war yes the regeneration of africa belongs to this new and powerful period by this term regeneration i wish to be understood to mean the entrance into a new life embracing the diverse phases of a higher complex existence the basic factor which assures their regeneration resides in the awakened raceconsciousness this gives them a clear perception of their elemental needs and of their undeveloped powers it therefore must lead them to the attainment of that higher and advanced standard of life the african people although not a strictly homogeneous race possess a common fundamental sentiment which is everywhere manifest crystalizing itself into one common controlling idea conflicts and strife are rapidly disappearing before the fusing force of this enlightened perception of the true intertribal relation which relation should subsist among a people with a common destiny agencies of a social economic and religious advance tell of a new spirit which acting as a leavening ferment shall raise the anxious and aspiring mass to the level of their ancient glory the ancestral greatness the unimpaired genius and the recuperative power of the race its irrepressibility which assures its permanence constitute the africans greatest source of inspiration he has refused to camp forever on the borders of the industrial world having learned that knowledge is power he is educating his children you find them in edinburgh in cambridge and in the great schools of germany these return to their country like arrows to drive darkness from the land i hold that this industrial and educational initiative and his untiring devotion to these activities must be regarded as positive evidences of this process of his regeneration the regeneration of africa means that a new and unique civilization is soon to be added to the world the african is not a proletarian in the world of science and art he has precious creations of his own of ivory of copper and of gold fine plated willowware and weapons of superior workmanship civilization resembles an organic being in its developmentit is born it perishes and it can propagate itself more particularly it resembles a plant it takes root in the teeming earth and when the seeds fall in other soils new varieties sprout up the most essential departure of this new civilization is that it shall be thoroughly spiritual and humanisticindeed a regeneration moral and eternal o africa like some great century plant that shall bloom in ages hence we watch thee in our dream see in thy swamps the prospero of our stream thy doors unlocked where knowledge in her tomb hath lain innumerable years in gloom then shalt thou waking with that morning gleam shine as thy sister lands with equal beam distinguished scholars on behalf of myself and the government and people of ghana it is my great pleasure to welcome you to ghana and to this first africanists conference to be held in africa i wish you every success
