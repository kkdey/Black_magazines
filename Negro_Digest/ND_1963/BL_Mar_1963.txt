the new challenge facing negro leaders
by eugene walton
or the first hundred ii  years following the   emancipation negro leadership has been absorbed m eradicating the last vestiges of slavery while the battle against jim crow is by no means won it has progressed to a point from which victory can be dimly seen this is certainly no time for negro leaders to let up in any way but a time to press on until this blemish has been completely obliterated from the american scene in achieving this victory they will have not only met and defeated a challenge to their own ingenuity and resourcefulness but eliminated a serious challenge to the whole american ideal as well but with crusades against social diseases as with crusades against physical diseases victory over one challenge only begets a new challenge and the thing that distinguishes successful from unsuccessful social movements is that the leaders of the former are more alert to recognizing new challenges and directing their energies toward meeting them if the ultimate goal of negro leaders is the elimination of all racial prerequisites to the enjoyment of the good life in america then they must surely recognize the differences between the challenge with which they have wrestled for the first hundred years of emancipation and the new challenge they face upon entering the second hundred years the old challenge has been negative in nature fighting against something but the new challenge is a positive one working for something the old challenge has been to knock out mandatory state supported segregation and other barriers that prevent the individual who happens to be darkskinned from competing and benefiting purely on the basis of merit the new challenge is the building of pride self respect and self esteem and confidence of negroes as a group and to devise and create a new and positive relationship for american negroes visavis american society the new challenge is to follow up the victory over racial barriers with a program that will inspire those previously barred to contribute effectively to the political economic and industrial life in america the new challenge is to provide his dispossessed with the intellectual inspirational and spiritual motivation and equipment required for them to fully benefit from the new oportunities that the removal of the barriers will permit under most circumstances the upgrading of a groups position within a larger environment necessitates accompanying changes within the group itself lest the whole effort fail in the case of the changing status of the negro in america these accompanying changes are doubly necessary because of some of the side effects that the long struggle for desegregation has had on the negro community this is to say that some of the arguments and positions advanced for the benefit of improving the negros status relative to his larger environment have caused certain unanticipated consequences in their attitudes toward themselves that tend to make any racial uplift task more difficult than it otherwise would have been what are some of these unanticipated consequences or side effects and how do they make the new challenge to negro leaders more difficult the first of these is that the negro man in the street is confused over goals on one hand and is cherishing unrealistic expectations on the other the questions raised are where are we negroes going and precisely what kind of bargain are we seeking to come out with is it limited to desegregation and free access to the public sector of american life or is it integration assimilation into the private sectors as well then is integration an end in itself or a means to some other end if so what is that end such questions are raised partly because the american mass media and some negro leaders have carelessly and consistently used the terms desegregation and integration interchangeably and failed to distinguish between the two mass circulation newspapers and magazines have been particularly guilty of reporting negroes efforts to desegregate public facilities under the heading of integration and negro leaders have been equally guilty in not correcting them all this has led the negro man in the street to be unsure of where nirvana is but yet to assume unrealistically that it is integration assimilation and that after the current struggle negroes and whites will live happily ever after the unrealism of this expectation was sharply pointed up by tilma cothran atlanta universitys specialist in social theory before the  convention of the american sociological association cothran reported that desegregation where it has occurred in the south has been accepted by whites mainly on the basis of conforming to the law and economic pressure and that very few have accepted the rightness of it even if all the barriers to integration were removed this scholar reported there would not be any tremendous association between whites and negroes the implications of the above situation for meeting the new challenge are serious for a people who are expecting to be consumed in the mainstream can hardly be expected to respond favorably to a program of racial uplift they would resist and oppose such an effort on the grounds that it betrayed what we have been fighting for assimilation and stood in the way of their long desired synthesis the more serious of the side effects of the long struggle is that all these years of talk about the importance of racial balance and integration having some whites mixed in to keep it from being allnegro regardless of what it happens to be has caused serious self depreciation and lack of group pride on the part of the negro in the street the clamor for integration has been so strong and stringent as to leave the implication that anything not integrated is ipso facto bad this subconsciously equating integrated with good and negro or allnegro with bad has created the kind of environment in which a young negro couple inspecting a house for sale asks is the school down the street integrated instead of asking is it the best school in town the new challenge of building the spirit and pride of the negro community in america can not possibly be met unless this unverbalized stigma that negroes attach to negro nonintegrated organizations and institutions is eliminated from their minds if the new goals of selfhelp and uplift are met at all it will surely be through the cooperation and coordination of predominantly negro organizations like the churches newspapers fraternal lodges and civic clubs organized at the grass roots level of the negro communities anyone who thinks that with the passing of state supported segregation negro institutions are going to fold up and die while the negro fades namelessly into the mass is just whistling in the dark besides these unanticipated consequences there are other elements in the current sociopolitical situation that will make the new challenge more difficult for negro leaders one is the existence of the organized black muslims as a new fact of life in applying their own solution to the new challenge black supremacy they have poisoned the air for the more legitimate racial uplift movement they have made it difficult for negro leaders to glorify the distinctive contributions of the negro to american life and to urge negroes to take pride in their negroness without running the risk of being branded a black supremacist or separationist another factor that will make the new challenge more difficult for negro leaders is that it calls for such new behavior on their part they have proven their ability to mobilize the negro community against something segregation but can they also mobilize it for something internal group betterment they will learn if they do not already know that it is one thing to get the negro to fight the evils of the white man but something else to get him to fight the evils within himself it is so much easier to lead a wrecking crew than to lead a construction gang unless a lot of old hands learn new tricks or are replaced with young new hands who know the new tricks the new challenge facing negro leadership could turn out to be more than they can handle these then are some of the consequences and factors that will make the job of negro leaders more difficult as they face their new challenge no one should kid himself about the magnitude of the task that lies ahead but in spite of the difficulty and the magnitude this is a challenge negro leaders can hardly afford not to face lest the whole victory of the first hundred years struggle assume a distinctly hollow ring and leave untouched certain conditions which the new challenge would overcome up to now the crime rate neighborhood deterioration illegitimacy and other unfavorable conditions that exist within the negro community have been blamed on the existence of racial segregation and discrimination such claims it should be clearly noted have been well founded since the correlation between social disorganization and socialeconomicpolitical deprivation can be supported by both rational and statistical arguments but with the passing or drastic reduction of segregation and discrimination this rationale will no longer be valid and yet to expect these conditions to right themselves automatically and without a positive program pushes ones confidence in human nature a bit far these are problems that will be with the negro community long after the court cases and sitins have removed the bars of discrimination unless its leaders face up to this reality and act positively to remedy the situation up to this point we have talked glibly about what the new challenge facing negro leadership is like and the difficulties they can expect in meeting it it would be nice if we could conclude by giving them a sure simple guaranteed solution but of course no such thing exists however we could mention two factors bearing on this problem which suggest that the task before negro leaders is far from hopeless first there is the existence of that magnificent body of negro contributions to american culture which we will call negro culture here lies a solid contribution in religious and nonreligious music humor literature and culinary art of which every american negro can be justly proud and which can be used as a kind of news peg for a program to build the spirit and pride of the negro community it provides an alternative to the black supremacy ideology used by the black muslims and can become an excellent positive starting place for a complete reorientation of the negro selfimage the second factor that makes the new challenge facing negro leadership more hopeful than hopeless is that there are already definite signs cthat negro leaders have recognized this challenge and are preparing to meet it most encouraging of these signs was the thematic tone of the  national convention of the urban league meeting the conference focused its attention on meeting the changing challenges of tomorrow and was keyed to the problems of unemployment due to automation school dropouts youth incentives migrant adjustment and family disorganization at the conference the executive director dr whitney young indicated that the league has been criticized for being too slow too conservative and failing to produce the results of the congress of racial equality the naacp the southern christian leadership conference and the studentnonviolent coordinating committee it could be we submit that the differences in perception of the effectiveness of these organizations is because the latter ones are reaping the glory of the finale of the original challenge while the league is tooling up to meet the new while the glory of the first century of struggle on behalf of the negro in america certainly belongs to the naacp it may very well be that the new challenge of the second century will belong to the urban league but more likely however it will belong to core naacp sclc urban league and many more organizations yet to be born the challenge is certainly large enough to engross them all 
the meaning of the i egro experience
by dr c eric lincoln
ne balmy afternoon in the late summer of  a ship of the royal dutch navy put about and tacked slowly into the harbor at jamestown virginia there was something strange about the appearance and the movement of the ship something grotesque and foreboding there was something repulsive and evil about that ship the colonists waiting at the dockside experienced an unaccustomed shudder of apprehension as with an ominous rumble the long anchor chain uncoiled itself and brought the ship up fast against the wharf the captain of the dutch ship caused the plank to be lowered and went ashore followed by as motley a crew of sailors as had ever put to sea their provisions were gone their water was gone they had no moneybut the captain explained that his ship carried a cargo well worth the provisions he wanted the settlers to exchange for it it was a strange cargo it was a cargo of men lying in the darkness in the hold of the dutch manofwar were one hundred separate items of human fleshchained ankle to ankle and wrist to wrist braving the terrible stench and ignoring the cries of the suffering captives by the dim light of a ships lantern the virginians picked out twenty and carried them ashore in chains by that act they founded in democratic america a most peculiar institution an institution about which thomas jefferson himself a slaveholder was to reveal the lacerations of his own conscience when he said i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever this was the first and most compelling image america has had of the negro the image of a commodity a thing to be bought and sold or exchanged a thing to be used in the production of wealth and power comfort and egosatisfaction for the benefit of those who own or have dominion over it with the clairvoyant wisdom which made him a great leader george washington had this to say about negroes as a commodity i shall be happily mistaken if they are not found to be a very troublesome species of property ere many years have passed over our heads george washington has been gathered with the blest for  years but that troublesome species of property first landed at jamestown virginia  years ago has perhaps proven mr washington unhappily unmistaken for men are not property they are not commodities they may not be bought and sold either on the slave block or at the employment office or in the courts or at the bargaining table or in the real estate office for so long as they are so long will they be troublesome the image of an explorer i have said that the early image most americans have of the negro in america is that of a commodity such was not the negros first role on this continent nor within the present boundaries of this country if no welldefined image consistent with his earlier experiences here has been developed then american history and racial understanding are poorer for the deficiency had you been aboard the good ship pinta on october   you would have noticed that among those rejoicing at the sighting of land was a small black man with the air of a scholar he was pedro alonzo nino navigator of the flag ship on which columbus sailed he was a negro if you had marched with balboa to the shores of the pacific in  you would have known nuflo de olano one of the thirty negroes included in his expedition or had you served with navarez in  you would have thrilled to the heroism of estevanico his negro lieutenant who led an expedition into what is now arizona and new mexico opening up the great southwest for european conquest estevanico died fighting the indians  years before the first wagon train rolled westward from the mississippi there were negroes with the spaniards in south america at the conquest of peru with the french in the settlement of the mississippi valley and the founding of chicago and in more recent times even with admiral peary at the discovery of the north pole but the image of the negro as an explorer has not been sustained in the mind of america indeed except for a handful of scholars the negros role in discovery and exploration has remained classified information the image of uncle tom let us look quickly at two other historical images both are stereotypes from the slave period one is that of a gentle old man his hair is white and woolly his back is bent and his shoulders are rounded from a lifetime of genuflection he observes a controlled deference to his betters and a supercilious indifference to the disapproval of his peers he is the medium through which communication passes from one class to another he is the channel of distribution moving from the top to the bottom he is the channel of information moving from the bottom to the top his function is that of control and pacification control of one class for the exploitation of another and the pacification of one class for the protection of another his personal reward is the favor and the protection of the power structure and they call him uncle tom he is rewarded by his peers with suspicion and hatred and envy and fear they rely upon his offices indeed they have no choice and they also call him uncle but never to his face this is an image of the american negro during the slave era it is an image which has persisted into quite recent times but it is an image which has been painfully eroded by the acids of social change the power structure has found the image of uncle tom to be a reliable agent of class control no longer the negro has found the image of uncle tom no longer capable of delivering even the oldtime fractional benefits once surreptitiously lifted from the treasury of american citizenship and further the negro today does not want anything that it takes an uncle tom to procure todays negro doesnt want charity he does want a chance uncle tom is in bad health he will soon be dead the image of a freedom fighter on the second of october in  there appeared in the boston gazette the following notice ran away from his master william brown  on the th of september last a negro fellow about  years of age named crispus  feet  inches high short curls hair his knees nearer together than common had on a light colourd bearskin coat    blue yarn stockings and a checked woolen shirt whoever shall take up said runaway and convey him to his    master shall have ten pounds    reward    history does not record whether the tall knockkneed negro was ever taken up and returned to his master but history has recorded the story of his martyrdom in the cause of american freedom it was the morning of march  that the first american patriot died for a cause which remains so dear to us all a cause we have since defended successfully many times but a cause which is forever in jeopardy for the enemies of freedom are not always strangers from abroad so often they lie coiled within the bosom of democracy itself on a cold blustery morning in march  years ago a company of british soldiers marched briskly up state street in the heart of downtown boston they had chosen state street because it was the principal street of what was then the principal city in america their objective was to remind the americans of their continued subjection to the british crown and to suppress with force any protestations of injustice or any complaints about secondclass citizenship the americans had become very unhappy over being taxed while being denied representation in the government taxation without representation is galling to any selfrespecting citizenry indeed no people could be reasonably expected to rejoice over a kind of citizenship that required them to share responsibility while privilege was withheld or deferred so it was that when the british soldiers swung arrogantly up the streetresplendent in their scarlet jackets and arrogant and confident in the superiority of their weapons they could not have been surprised to find themselves challenged to be sure the challenge did not come from the class with vested interests for that class was in league with the crown the challenge came from the kind of men for whom principle is more important than wealth or station or even personal security the challenge came from men for whom the vision of equality and justice for all was a presently attainable objective facing the british at the end of state street was a handful of patriots at the head was crispus attucks a man who had established his personal freedom by running away as a youth but who had now as a man returned to play his part in making a more complete freedom available for every americanincluding the master who had put a price on his head as the company of redcoats approached attucks turned to his supporters the way to get rid of these soldiers he said is to attack the main guard with sticks and clubs and whatever weapons that came to hand the americans did attack as crispus attucks led the charge the british soldiers opened fire and he was first to fall three men died with attucks at the boston massacre but the struggle against tyranny had been joined and ultimately the cause of freedom and justice did prevail that america is today a free country testifies most eloquently to the availability of freedom when brave men work together in mutual confidence and determination today we are all free but we are not yet equally free we have been a long time completing the job begun in boston so many years ago crispus attucks provides an image of the american negro as a freedom fighter not many americans remember attucks fewer still not his race his statue still stands on the boston greensward along with those of other heroes of the american revolution for attucks was the first american of any race to give his life in the cause of freedom it is a pity that the editors of our childrens textbooks do not know this or do not think it significant for these times there were many others to follow attucks for the freedom of america did not mean that all americans were free the struggle to be free was continued by negro leaders like nat turner denmark vesey gabriel prosser and others whose names are lost to history contrary to the widely circulated fiction of the negros docile acceptance of slavery there were at least  recorded revolts in america between  and  a period of  years in addition there were no fewer than fiftyfive revolts at sea during a similar period since it was the practice to suppress news about slave uprisings less they become infectious it is reasonable to assume that scores of insurrections must have gone unrecorded the historical image of the negro as a freedom fighter is certainly one which must be considered if the current struggle for freedom and dignity is to have perspective we need to talk about the past because the present has no meaning except with reference to the past and to the future america cannot hope to understand the complex image of the contempo rary negro unless there is an historical screen against which to project it we cannot understand the sitins the freedom riders the black muslims the naacp or even the urban league except in the context of antecedent behavior the keys to the negros resentments his forebearance his hostility his love his patience his weariness with waiting his resignation and his determination are all there in his previous condition but the full story of his previous condition is not a mere tale of abject servitude there has not been enough said about the past the negros strengths and his weaknesses are reflected in the images he has of himself and others have of him most negroes have displayed a childish squeamishness about probing negro history they have been too afraid that research might lead to some dark jungle and that the negro would be further disgraced they have been too afraid of being deprived of certain convenient excuses for comfortable mediocrity they seem to enjoy in a segregated society the white man has preferred not to disturb the negros past because he wants no new challenge to his moral consciousness no new feelings of guilt he does not wish to risk the possibility that some outofdate conclusions may on reexamination require some adjustment in his habits of thinking or patterns of behavior it sometimes appears that negroes and whites are joined in a conspiracy of silence for their mutual protection against social and moral embarrassment the threefold myth the racial chauvinists in the south are far from silent in centennial celebrations all over the old confederacy the diehards are resurrecting the pale grey ghost of the civil war they are doing so with the meek compliance of the north and very often with the financial and technical assistance of agencies of the federal government which might well be occupied with more plausible and more socially profitable undertakings the civil war image of the south being offered today to americas innocent and unsuspecting children and to their unprotesting parents is very often fraudulent fictional irrelevant and inane it is an image which carefully ignores the fundamental issues over which the civil war was fought white supremacy is busily engaged in beating a dead horse to make him win a race that is over the resurrection of the grand illusion would be pathetic if ours were a more sophisticated or even a more moral society unfortunately the trinal myth of the negros inherent inferiority his satisfaction with thingsastheyare and the white mans good intentions to be executed of his own initiative byeandbye is still supported by a formidable cult if the negro continues his attacks upon the segregated institutions of the north the cult of the grand illusion is certain to grow larger at least for a time bigotry must have an image of its victim consistent with its aim the negros selfimage the negro has some images of himself whereas outsiders tend to see one negroa composite stereotyped image of the race negroes see themselves as a multifaceted american subgroup with many images some good some indifferent some bad what is the negros image of the negro in america it depends upon which negro you ask it is the dramatic image of thurgood marshall pleading the cause of human justice before the high court of the nation and the conscience of the people it is the image of a shoeshine boy in nashville refusing to scramble for a ioc tip flipped into the gutter at his feet it is the image of martin_luther_king challenging a hatefilled and often violent postchristian society to relearn the great principles of the sermon on the mountshowing them how to win over hatred with love and how to overcome violence with humble faith and selfrestraint it is the image of elijah muhammadblack messenger of a black god calling the disconsolate and arming them with hatred a bitter man this muhammad and one tired of waiting for his share of america leader of the militant black muslims who return hatred for hatred insult for insult blow for blow a black supremacist in search of victory over white supremacy it is the image of jackie robinson maintaining speed while shifting gearsmoving on from a brilliant career in sports to an executive position in a major american business enterprise it is the image of ralph bunche doing a job for his country and losing his racial identity in the process it is the image of ralph boston and wilma rudolph saving the day for america on the olympic fields of the world it is the image of malcolm_x strident apostle of black nationalism preaching in the black ghettos debating at the universities haranguing on the street comers shouting from the television screen and the eleven oclock radio shows think black buy black stay black and beware the white mans phony integration it is the image of louis armstrong the ambassador with a horn at his lips and of chubby checker teaching the world a new twist it is the image of nine little teenagers at little rocks central high schoolignoring the insults accepting the hot soup poured on their heads the lighted cigarettes dropped down their backs the screaming mothers the bombs and the dynamite while the world recoiled in horrorand then cheered and cheered and cheered it is the image of college youth all over americasitting in riding in wading in reading in kneeling inand sometimes having to crawl outgoing to jail accepting their punishment and then sitting in again it is the image of the urban league executives working quietly but persuasively with the concerned and responsible citizens of the great metropolisestrying to make urban living better for all the people irrespective of race or creed the negros image of the negro is sometimes one of a steadily increasing middleclass with all of the status pretentions of the white middle class it is the image of a burgeoning black bourgeosie striving mightily to become totally assimilated into the mainstream of america and suffering massive frustration for having failed there is another imageone of hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers caught in the deteriorated inner circle of the great cities of america the black ghettos ringed with bands of steelpolitical steel economic steel the cold hard steel of prejudice it is the image of crime of drug addiction alcoholism burglary desertion assault prostitution gambling and murder it is the image of unemployment destitution bitterness hopelessness disease and resignation it is the image of extreme poverty in the midst of an affluent society it is the image of a raw deal it is the image of a keg of powder with a six inch fuse the image of a hungry man the most compelling image i know of the contemporary negro is that of a hungry man this is the era of the hungry man to some the abominable hungry man the hungry man is the symbol of very many millions ol people who are hungry for food hungry for understanding hungry for freedom and selfdetermination but most of allhungry for the dignity without which a man is a thing a chattel and a commodity the dignity without which a man is a misfit a monstrous joke in his own eyes a broken vessel in the eyes of god the sign of the hungry man is his determination his dedication his quiet insistence and his courage it is the sign of the search for dignity the negro is like a certain hungry man who though an uninvited guest has seated himself as unobtrusively as possible at the banquet table of america since he was not invited he has come of his own accord since no place was set for him he has brought his own utensils this makes him abominable for no diner of good breeding comes unasked and then brings to the table his own knife and fork but this hungry man has come to eat he feels his right to be there for he has shared in the cultivation of the fields in the production of the food and in the protection of the common heritage that is america from the hostile incursions of our common enemies who would have put us all to the sword the hungry man is seated at the banquet table of america he sees the rich viands passed back and forth in front of him as the opulent diners officially ignore his presence and make merry eating and drinking to satiety i say that the hungry man is officially ignored for behind the convivial facade the light and pleasant chatter the clever exchange of anecdotes there is an uneasy awareness that the hungry man is about to become a problem he refuses to go away he doesnt seem to frighten anymore he is dressed in evening clothes like all the other diners and he sits there like a man who is determined to be served he is quiet and dignified but he has big shoulders he has big hands the problem how to pacify him with the least cost and inconvenience how to get him outor get him served without a commotion that may well spoil the banquet for everybody but the hungry man isnt leaving he has come to eat he has come to stay he has taken his seat at the banquet table he worked so faithfully to help prepare he is sittingin until hes served this is his moment in the struggle for freedom and dignity throughout the world a world in which men have been enslaved by men for so long that the orderly processes of history have been disturbed and the moral nature of man has been grotesquely distorted the negros prevailing selfimage is in general reflected in the determination that if the most desirable values of our society have been consistently preempted on the arbitrary basis of race then the forces which sustain that arrangement ought to be challenged his struggle is nothing more than what america ought to expect of its citizens the selfrespecting contemporary negro is determined that color shall no longer be the criterion by which his opportunities and his personal dignity and worth are to be measuredneither in the south nor in the north nor anywhere else in this democratic society shackles may be made of iron lacerating the flesh and restraining the body but there are shackles of custom and tradition the prejudice which binds the mind kills the spirit and deforms the soul of anyone it touches negroes will no longer submit to bigotry america can no longer expect it of them the essence of the negro almost a hundred years have passed since the fourteenth amendment recognized the image of the negro to be the image of a citizen a hundred years is a very long time for people in an equalitarian democracy to fail to make fully effective the normal expectations of citizenship our national behavior has not been consistent with the very reasonable expectation that the highest values available on equal terms to all instead of working to eliminate causes we have been expending our resources on symptoms instead of policing the forests we have been dissipating our energies running from brush fire to brush firetoo late and with too little water instead of looking for essence we have been looking at images and trying to construct programs on sands that shift with each passing wind an image is a chimera it is always changingalways appearing differently from different perspectives an image is always reflecting the vicissitudes of the times the pressures and opportunities of the moment it is always partly the creation of the man who perceives it image is what you see essence is what you feel in trying to deal with an image one may miss the broader opportunity of encountering a person i have to say that there is no one image of the negro upon which sincere people should attempt to base their social attitudes one can no more generalize about  million black americans than one can about  million white americans image is what you see essence is what you feel human images differ from day to day from group to group and within the group every group human essence is the same in all menall the time it is that peculiar quality which makes a man a man and separates him from all other possibilities it is essence with which we ought to be concerned for if we were there could be but one image and that would be the image of america

ghere is a harlem in new york city and there is a harlem in albany georgia that is where the ordinary negro lives out his life there are two lines that william butler yeats set down about another country also productive of special talents but generally inhabited by propertyless country people and their children parnell came down the road he said to a cheering man ireland shall get her freedom and you still break stone  a friend of mine talked recently to a negro who had traveled the south looking for work i like to get to a town early the negro said when the garbage trucks are out i look at the back to see whos handling the garbage if its a white man i move on theres no job in that town for  »? me to this have we come one hundred years after the emancipation proclamation how strange that we who are white should think of that date with pride and that the negro should think of it with gratitude every reference to it is a reminder that as recently as our greatgrandfathers time americans held other americans as bond slaves and might well have kept holding them if the south had not gone to war to expand the limits of a system which the north was resigned merely to containing still we boast of this event and the negro is appreciative of it perhaps the stereotypes are accurate and white people are smug and negroes are instinctively polite yet even an instinct may be submerged by the overpowering pressures of circumstances pressures which can produce the muslims a current concern of fashion it is not a fashion i am afraid that has much to do with what they are about because the concern is for their words and not their faces the muslims are most relevant to an unmentioned fact about the negros real situation in the american city most black nationalists are persons of small education in middle age with menial employment the rest of their lives holds no other prospect integration if it came tomorrow would not alter their lives integration cannot make the poor comfortable and the untrained skillful the american economy seems peculiarly designed for the care and feeling of incompetent white men the union fleshpeddler the sheriff of holmes county mississippi the television space salesman the loud man in the saloon all these luxuries of a wasteful society have no real claim upon our contributions to their comfort except that they are citizens and white if they were negroes how many of them would have any expression but black nationalism the negro makes his way to the extent he makes it at all only as creator there are important negro novelists but no fashionable negro critics negroes produce jazz for which the explanatory notes are always written by white critics the parasitic occupations are not for negroes our surplusage sits in offices exercising its imagination only to fabricate expense accounts their surplusage sits on doorsteps in harlem in the daytime there will never be many muslims but i should be surprised if there were not a little muslim in every negro it would be hard to think of an american negro no matter how psychologically integrated who does not enjoy the speeches of malcolm_x a negro who hates us so much that he adopted the initial x to erase his original surname of little which he has to assume belonged originally to the white family that also owned his ancestors but there is no muslim either who is so thoroughly alienated as he says and genuinely feels he is i once served as chairman of a roundtable of negro speakers one of whom was malcolm_x the audience was largely muslim it was a few days after a los angeles muslim temple had been shot up by the local police malcolm_x was in a condition of honest shock and indignation and his audience cheered fervently his message that no white man deserved to be liked or trusted my main function for the occasion was as object to be pointed at in evidence yet as i was leaving three muslims came up to meet me and asked whether i could go to los angeles and find out the truth about what had happened to their brothers they were that ready to trust an enemy they had never seen before that night for there is also a little bit of every negro which understands what camus meant when he said that we are all condemned to live together yet the act of living together can provide release this is a lesson jackie robinson taught perhaps the most conventional of all the things robinson did for america is seldom mentioned robinson could be harsh combative and ungracious after a while he was free to be these things when the fit was on him that right was hardearned for him but he gave us for nothing the priceless boon of being able to dislike him as a human being it was never possible not to respect robinson but it was easy if you were not a dodger fan to be affronted by his belligerence on the field he did not represent a race he competed for a team it was a moment of emancipation for him and for us the first time he was booed not as a negro but as jackie robinson a dodger player robinsons last important hit in baseball was a triple in the  world series against the yankees he hit it as a judgment of history over the head of enos slaughter a north carolinian who as a saint louis cardinal had welcomed robinson to the major leagues and the border south by trying to spike him that nigger robinsons hit won the game for the dodgers afterwards a brave sports writer asked slaughter whether he might not have misjudged the ball there aint a left fielder in this game could have caught that ball slaughter answered i never saw even that bastard hit a ball that hard it was jackie robinsons triumph that when he came into the league enos slaughter called him that nigger and when he went out enos slaughter called him that bastard sonny liston may tell us still more than robinsonor even ralph buncheabout the negros progress since emancipation liston is the first morallyinferior negro to be given an equal chance at a position revered by any great number of his fellow americans that is a revolutionary movement for to be a negro in america is to be required to be superior to your station in life liston has an impressive crimimcprh mest mccci nal record but he is not the first thug of this generation to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world by all evidence he is a cleaner fighter inside the ring than tony galento ever thought of being but he is the first negro thug to have that chance before liston a negro heavyweight was expected not merely to fight well enough to win the office but to ennoble it when he got it the most significant opposition to listons advancement did not come from the white citizens councils to whom any negro is as bad as any other unless that other is like floyd patterson a member of the national association for the advancement of colored people it came rather from negroes who thought liston might disgrace their community there were reports that ralph bunche had asked patterson not to risk this disaster there is of course a gap between negroes who have made their way in the white world and those who have been left behind but in this case bunche seemed to reflect a universal sentiment harlem by all accounts was as united against liston as it had been against any challenger for the championship since joe louis fought max schmeling in  yet for once at least the negro has judged us whites unfairly sonny liston is not a negro hoodlum to us but simply a hoodlum in his small way he is rendering the special service so many other negroes have given america which is to tell us the truth about ourselves he is the first heavyweight champion to suggest to us the truth about the office he holds it was affecting to have a champion who talked as though he were seeking admission to the university of mississippi but it was also ridiculous pathetic and deceptive sonny liston is a symbol of national maturity there is no longer danger that he will discredit the negro he offers only the bright promise of giving boxing the discredit it has deserved all these years we shall never again i am sure have a member of the presidents cabinet unequipped with a special assistant who is a negro one of his duties a basic necessity of government is to provide protective coloration sonny liston has finally relieved the negro of this function for boxing maturity comes more slowly in other areas of national life but the last five years of all this depressing century have been the best and they began somewhere when no one was looking they might be said for purposes of identification to have begun in clay kentucky where the negro settlement is by decision of the citizens of clay outside of town a nineyearold boy named james gordon was listening to the radio and heard about the national guard being summoned to enforce integration in a school a hundred miles away mommy he asked why cant i go to the white school if his mother answered you got the guts to go i got the guts to take you and he and she went down to the school together and were driven off with shotguns and the national guard came in for them too there were never many of them yet they and the children who follow them have turned and changed that which everyone had thought would be the inevitable development of the south a decade ago the hope of the south was generally considered to be in its upper middle class the south was full of white people who understood that segregation waswhat was that expressionmorally wrong and who reached out their hands to what tiny negro middle class there was but now they are silent it was out of the black poor the most powerless and abandoned of our citizens that people came who had the guts to go the white middle class can no longer talk to the negro middle class but there has come the poor barely literate southern negro child meeting the poor white face to face enforcing a reminder of his human identity and because of these children it will never again be easy for a southern deputy sheriff to think one negro like every other charley jones of charlotte north carolina has been in prison eight times as a core leader the last time was in albany georgia where by then the police were so welltrained and circumspect that some advanced social thinkers complained that there was not enough violence to dramatize the problem and dont you think its nice that theyre not beating us up any longer charley jones answered i guess youve never been in a southern jail how proud a southern negro woman is of a son who goes to jail the negro male is peculiarly a menial in this culture and he is a menial whose degradation is less in demand than it once was the negro woman as domestic is most often the support of the family the image of a negro boy who wills to go to jail to assert himself a man is a sudden delightful surprise i dont think its fair an albany mother said last summer to get a boy out of jail if he dont want to who would have thought that these school children when they began might have done something as important as to make life easier for every poor southern negro who goes to jail a hundred years later they have started where the emancipation proclamation should have started all these things are of course simple and obvious but after a century it remains a particular complication that what is truly obvious is so seldom said a mother reported with pride to me the other m day her daughters comment on the mississippi riots but this little girl had said its all so simple it doesnt make any difference what color anyones skin is but what is simple and obvious is quite the opposite it makes an enormous difference what color a mans skin is the difference is not just in the places a negro is kept out of but in the atmosphere of the places he gets into i have a friend who is a reporter for one of the news magazines his specialties  exceptionally nonparochial for a negroare labor and politics he was in chicago one day and stopped in to see adlai stevenson right after his greeting stevenson said wryly that he supposed his visitor had come to talk about civil_rights when he was only a candidate for president john f kennedy met twice with jackie robinson to solicit his support the meetings were cold hostile and left the senator baffled what does robinson want he asked one of those he questioned asked in turn what they had talked about oh civil_rights of course senator kennedy answered only civil_rights of course said the senator white southerners thought for years that negroes werent interested in civil_rights we are more enlightened we think they arent interested in anything else any negros face in a white public place in our world is consequently likely to be the face of the negro that is the problem in some ways he has more privacy in the south because he is taken for granted there how many secret meetings of white citizens council leaders have been held in offices while the omnipresent negro porter went in and out emptying ash trays this is not a fanciful notion i once spent a long afternoon in the office of a citizens council leader in a southern city near the end he turned confidential you know he said theres something i dont understand they know everything we do just as soon as we do i bet theyve got my office wired right now and are taking down everything i say a negro porter was cleaning his waiting room at that moment and could certainly hear everything he said i looked at the porter and constructed a whole network of colored domestics reporting back on masters who like this one were not even aware of their presence i sat there and elected him a conspirator and laughed inside and cheered him on but was that not an invasion of his privacy an assumption one would hardly make about a stranger unless that stranger were a negro it was at best a mixed compliment to refuse to spy can after all be a point of pride so it does make a difference when your face is a label and once a society decides without feeling any need to ask him that a man is nothing except the burning embodiment of a problem with time he comes to seem to us only a crank to government he seems only an inconvenience mississippi would have been quiet if james meredith had not insisted on enrolling in its university offer no victims and there will be no mobs the negro affronts our conscience less than he disturbs our peace and there is a little bit of government in all of us we only are when we see a negro we confront someone who threatens to become to narrow the question almost everyone seems to know by now that white people do not understand the negro but is what everyone knows necessarily the truth we owe to unknown southern negroes whatever has been epic in the history of the united states for the last ten years cooks and maids poor farmers students in colleges that hardly have libraries have become authors of that history cities where no change seemed possible have found themselves at the mercy of little colored children who have gone afraid but proud to prison and emerged laughing sonny liston looks back over what has been as close to an animal existence as could be possible for an american and the only figure outside his world who seems to him worthy of admiration is martin_luther_king and who predicted this wild card in our history except william faulkner we know now that we should have gone to him to find out what the southern negro could do in the same way we wentwe know now to richard wright and ralph ellison and james baldwin not to find out what negroes are but what white people are what is more likely i am afraid is that whatever our color we do not understand ourselves 
how to spot phony intellectual
by horton floyd
he definitions a q of an intellectual proj vided by websters jd new international dictionary are the following a person endowed with intellect having the power of understanding having the capacity for the higher forms of knowledge or thought  a member of a party or faction claiming to represent or regarded as representing intelligent opinion    the above definitions have to do with people who are intellectuals and therefore have the right to be called intellectuals interestingly enough however the people who fit the definitions usually are the people who prefer not to be labelled as intellectuals they take their intelligence and erudition for granted and go about the business of creative labor contributing to art and science and literature and philosophy breastbeating and posturing are characteristics alien to these people they are true intellectuals on the other hand there is a vast and growing breed of poseurs who have all but abrogated to themselves the term intellectual the adjective pseudo which means phony probably best describes them generally but within the group as a whole there are a multitude of variations some of the more familiar specimens of this allembracing breed are described below the philosopher this is the highesttype pseudointellectual for his or her realm of specialized knowledge is in the rarified heights of philosophical profundity with this type it is impossible to engage in a simple uncomplicated discussion all conversa  tional avenues lead to quotations from aristotle and plato and every current situation must be considered in the context of great philosophical concepts with this intellectual any sentence or statement is challengeable he delights in differing and will proceed to prove that black is not really black or that the tree standing ten feet away does not really exist names like kant hegel sartre hobbes and descartes and terms like nihilism existentialism theism and empiricism fall from the lips of the philosophical intellectual with the ease of water dripping from a faucet concepts like truth beauty and love which every normal human being is content to accept in their ordinary and usual connotations must be laid out under the microscope of philosophical technique and analyzed and dissected into utter meaninglessness the philosophical intellectual seems happiest when communication is most muddled which may very well be the best indication of the state of his own mentality the psychoanalyst this species is very close to the preceding species they may be said to be unidentical twins while the philosopher is concerned with considering everything in the light of a philosophical discipline the psychoanalyst is intent on forcing everything through the funnel of freudian interpretation the psychoanalyst never accepts anything at face value he must of necessity get to the real meaning behind every word or gesture and this real meaning is never apparent it must always be ferreted out to this unlicensed headshrinker sleeplessness is proof of a guilty conscious friendship for someone of the same sex is latent homosexuality and opposition to domineering parents means an oedipus complex is abroad in the psyche most of the time these amateur analysts have simply had a few college courses in psychology and using their own troubled souls as springboards are intent on proving their superior insight and education the deadliest of the species however are those whose unsolvable problems led them to the professional analysts couch these specimens are like religious zealots they talk and think about nothing but headshrinking and their analysts are the very disciples of the great god freud that these people are sick goes without saying what is significant is the nature of their malady almost without exception they are afflicted with a feeling of inferiority so deep and so basic that not even all of freuds vast army of followers could dig it out and kill it the beard this is a relatively new species of pseudo intellectual in the united states as a whole for many years their habitat in this country was limited by the borders of new yorks greenwich village but they escaped a decade or so ago to places like san francisco and taos and have been generously flourishing all over the landscape ever since speaking generally the beards are a harmless bunch often charming and occasionally even genuine intellectuals may be found among them one such is novelist john a williams a masterful writer and a fine young man who confessed in an article in nugget magazine that he affected his whiskers to disguise an unromantic chin while many of the beardwearing musicians may be classified as intellectuals some like the modern jazz quartets john lewis being the real item all of them are not some musicians wear beards like badges in much the same fashion as phi beta kappas or legionnaires the beards under consideration here are rarely musicians although they sometimes affect a great passion for jazz they are free and independent and rebellious souls or they like to think of themselves in that image but it is dangerous to pursue the question of what they are free from independent of and rebellious against for their answers if they are articulate enough to give answers will usually serve to strip from them every facade of glamour far too frequently it develops that they are free of jobs and the desire to find remunerative work they are independent of responsibility and its concomitant stability and they are in rebellion against maturity of course they will put it differently they will give longwinded speeches about the conformity of american society the degradation of to labor and the utter meaninglessness of the struggle for achievement it is perhaps cruel to say so but far too many of these bearded rebels merely have a greater conception of their own value than they find it possible to express being frustrated by limited talent they take refuge in unlimited posing the excess hair helps to give the distinction they so desperately crave but seem unable to earn the aficionado aficionado is a spanish word meaning roughly a fan it is usually applied to followers of bullfighting those fevered addicts who know and savor every twist of the toreros toe every sweep of the cape every lunge of the bull transported across the atlantic aficionado has come to mean on the one hand an expert and on the other hand a knowitall and since a true expert is a person secure in his knowledge with no need for pretense aficionado does not apply to the expert in this case the concern here is with the aficionado as a knowitallor a phony this species of intellectual is usually found on the periphery of the arts especially jazz he calls all the musicians by their first names just as if he knows them and he uses all the wayout terminology current among jazz musicians bird parker the dead tenor saxophonist is the hallowed and sanctified high priest and miles davis is the holy son there is no other music but jazz and no other musicians but jazzmen and cursed be those who do not worship at the shrine and honor the commandments dope the instrument of death and dishonor among so many jazz musicians holds a very special place in the mystique of the aficionados world it is the open sesame to that surrealistic and levitated mood so endemic to that realm of night while more prevalent on the edges of jazz the aficionado is also found on the outskirts of art sometimes he is a painter an inept one who attempts to compensate for his inadequacy by affecting the airs of a connoisseur he knows what is good painting and what is junk and the incomprehensibles of socalled modern art are all clarities to him whatever the artist was trying to express the aficionado understands it and if it just so happens that the artist in fact was merely expressing his own boredom and lack of imagination then the aficionado comes to the rescue by seeing beyond this aridity to irrepressible talent ah the aficionado is indomitable unconquerable supremely confident in an ignorance without bounds the africanist this is the very latest of the species in the pseudointellectual breed and it is growing with all deliberate speed the most vocal and enthusiastic of this species are those whoa scant decade agowould have come close to puking had it been suggested that they identify with africa and africans now they adore anything african they almost have reached the point where they love anything black but they havent become that extreme yet they talk knowingly of ashanti stools and yoruba culture and the hausa language and can roll off the capitals of the three areas of nigeria with more ease than they can name the states of new england they can hold forth for hours on the glories of ancient mali or the power of the old ghana kings or the beauties of the songhay regime they speak with great erudition of the concept of negritude and could not if their lives depended on it give a coherent statement of the concepts meaning having seized africa and claimed it for their very own they will denounce and challenge anyone who even hints that africans are not all fine and noble and beautiful in short these africaloving pseudointellectuals use africa as a crutch in very much the same way that the aficionados use jazz as a crutch there is a strange militancy about their procedure africa they feel is on the ascendancy and if they can identify with it now then they can ascend with it they will never have to recognize and admit that they havent the stuff to make it on their own there are many other species of the breed of pseudointellectual but the abovementioned ones are the most prevalent true intellectuals have a largeness of outlook and spirit phony intellectuals are narrow and mean they are easy enough to sight they are seldom thoughtful compassionate and willing to listen they are always cocksure and arrogant and all too often wrong 
floyd patterson revisited
by hosea l martin 
few months ago a friend of mine sent me the july issue of negro digest in his accompanying letter he called my attention to the article are todays athletes too dull by a s doc young im sure my friend sent me the magazine as a joke since i was something of a lackluster athlete in my college days at any rate the article was quickly read and just as quickly forgotten or more truthfully it was filed in that compartment of my mind reserved for articles by frustrated sportswriters who couldnt make their high school football team then came september and the pattersonliston fight ordinarily i have only a passing interest in boxing perhaps because a turbulent boyhood on chicagos south side left me unable to appreciate or understand the spectacle of two grown men beating hell out of each  other with mere fists when there were so many really effective weapons at their disposal on th street the cardinal rule had been waste no time with fists and hands when a brick can send em to the promised land violation of this rule could possibly afford the individual his only opportunity to have his name appear in the chicago defenderin the section labeled obituaries my reaction to the pattersonliston skirmish however was a little more than slightly different however passive it might have been i was giving my support to patterson for somehow the mass media had been able to project the image of a young man epitomizing those virtues we find so admirable in public figures skill reticence and a sense of the importance of his position while still maintaining a posture of humility and childlike awe the fact that he was beaten didnt disturb me for defeat has nothing to do with the shattering of an image what truly disturbed me was the unconcealed glee that greeted the news of his defeat was i alone in my admiration of floyd patterson i asked myself and if so what was there about him that blinded others to his qualities that i considered so attractive these were the questions that compelled me to return to that dustcovered issue of negro digest surely i thought mr young would have an explanation for the almost universal rejection of this fallen warrior so i carefully reread that profound article and not being able to believe my eyes read it a third time the fourth reading convinced me that neither advancing age nor the strenuous military life i was leading had impaired my vision to the extent that i would miss a name on a printed page the only conclusion i could draw was that mr young was guilty of a monumental sin of omission in his classification of sports figures he had not classified floyd patterson as neither colorful nor colorless in fact patterson had not been mentioned at all now it doesnt take a mel allen or jimmy powers to realize that the heavyweight boxing championship is in the eyesight of many as significant a position as the presidency of the united states i will always cherish the memory of that seemingly dull student in my high school civics class who couldnt recall where the president resided but volunteered to recite the training sites of louis charles and walcott if one claims that that student should have been admonished then the same punishment should apply to the millions of adults who deemed it their duty to sit glued to their radios until the last punch was thrown in a championship match yet thought nothing of retiring early on the night of a presidential election you will note that i said those devotees sat glued to their radios until the last punch was thrown i make this distinction because many negroes during the era of joe louis felt that the postfight statements by the brown bomber were just too painful to listen to so the wireless was promptly switched off the moment he was called to the mike the few brave ones who did listen to louis classic hi ma i glad i win would invariably squirm with embarrassment and moan why cant he devote a little of his training time to the study of english fewer still were able to recognize and appreciate the pure exhilaration and sincerity conveyed by louis clumsy statement it had an effect on that few that has never been approached by the flowery rhetoric of sugar ray robinson or archie moore but the fact remained that the great hero had flaws glaring flaws that were quickly noted and laughed at by the caucasian public they laughed at his broken english his marital problems and in later years his financial shortsightedness they laughed and soon their laughter began to have its effect on negroes what good is it they began to ask themselves if joe beats billy conn and conn winds up an oil millionaire while joe goes broke paying taxes what satisfaction is there in knowing that our joe is the most skilled ringman in the world if we must look askance at his naive behavior outside the ring their only consolation was the hope that some day the title would be held by a negro who was as wellschooled in the social graces as he was in pugilism i it was a long wait the short reigns of charles and walcott fighters who possessed many of louis flaws but few of his virtueshad to be endured next came the seemingly endless but really short era of marciano an outsider whose retirement was i little lamented by negroes finally the long awaited day arrived on a wintry night of november of  floyd patterson descended messianically to fulfill the dreams of negro boxing fans perhaps many will accuse me of sacrilege for comparing the advent of patterson with that of the messiah but who can deny that he was a dream come true his soft polished voice revealed a command of language that was often used devastatingly against snide reporters what a joy he was to listen to on a sports interview show the fact that he didnt make the national bestdressed lists was proof that his taste in clothing leaned toward conservatism and negroes like most americans equate conservatism with dignity add to this the facts that he had a placid almost dull home life had never been photographed in a nightclub andwonders of wonderswas even reported to be saving his money and you have the picture of a sports figure the negro public should have immediately clasped to its breast the fact that it didnt left pattersons admirers bewildered and frustrated they asked the same questions that i asked at the beginning of this article but most of us were unwilling to dig for an answer at the time finally the article by mr young goaded me into launching a factfinding program i hope the answers ive come up with are satisfactory to the ones who failed to discover a similar incentive first it should be pointed out that louis and the negro boxers who preceded him were symbols they were looked upon as symbols of the last negro citadel that had been assaulted but not taken by caucasians the citadel of physical prowess in that era the negro had all but conceded the intellectual war because for each dunbar and hughes he pointed to the caucasian could cite dozens of his own kind that were equal if not better and each time the negro praised his dr drew or dr carver the caucasian would cluck disdainfully and match this claim with a multitude of einsteins comptons and millikans only a foolhardy few however would even dare to claim they ever had a fighter who surpassed joe louis but something happened during world war ii and immediately after it was something that would profoundly affect the status of boxers as well as all sports figures for suddenly the negro had a change of heart about giving up the intellectual war and thus launched an attack that would eventually move the struggle between black and white outside the sports arena and into the world of ideas the physical aspect of the struggle was being supplanted by the intellectual one which was perhaps a little less violent but certainly a great deal more intense in short the seeds that had been sown by the participants of the harlem renaissance began to bear fruit this meant that the negro no longer had to limit himself to one idol there were now so many in so many fields that he could choose fromwith little if any fear that they would be ignored or scoffed at by the caucasian public who was going to scoff at ralph bundles competence as a statesman when the world had bestowed upon him one of its highest honors and would anyone dare expose his lack of good taste by laughing at the writings of james baldwin or ralph ellison after the worlds most celebrated critics had acclaimed them no longer did the negro have to enter a theater with apprehension for instead of the uncle tomish performances he had been subjected to in the past he could now look forward to seeing stars like sidney poitier and sammy davis jr handling roles that were believable even in the sports world the negro found that he had to divide his loyalties among a host of brownskinned starsand all of them werent boxers either should he stay on channel  and watch jimmy brown cavort on the pro football field or should he switch to channel  and watch wilt chamberlain make shambles of the pro basketball record book should he root for elston howard and the yankees or should he stick with hank aaron and the braves in fact things were going so well for the negro sports fan that in  many of them had been tempted to write and accuse the sportswriters of america of prejudice in selecting an all negro all  american basketball team after all they reasoned they didnt want their children encouraged to brag about black supremacy it was into this climate of negro achievement that floyd patterson stepped in  he had won the championship in hopes of filling a vacuum only to discover too late that it was already crowded it was like the cavalry arriving after the wagon train had been rescued by the infantry despite this however i still feel that the negro owes patterson something i view him as the heir to a position that for a long time was the only thing the negro could reach out and touch and say in this much we are supreme i realize that today the heavyweight boxing championship has been stripped of its importance and has outlived its usefulness as a symbol but is this really any reason for the negro to hold it in less esteem in britain as well as other european countries the monarchy was long ago deprived of its governing functions and yet it is retained for the simple reason that it reminds the people of the glory that once was theirs it is something they consider a part of their heritage and consequently should be preserved and cherished for a nation that is ashamed of its history is ashamed of itself and whether he likes it or not boxing has been an important part of the negros history but all of this will probably fall on deaf ears so i have resigned myself to a comer of each room and barbershop where i will be unable to hear the derisive remarks about floyd patterson my ears are good though and i know that sooner or later one of those remarks will reach them when this happens i know that i will not be able to keep myself from shouting but he was the champion 
the growing rebellion in the negro church
by the rev mr charles h king
startling statement was one of the slave codes in the state of mississippi and the year it was written was  in  today  years later the negro minister is still facing the dilemmas of his profession though not a recipient of physical lashes he is increasingly feeling the lashes inflicted by his problems and is beginning to pay the cost the silver bluff baptist church organized in  stands today as a monument of the original negro church in america organized by a negro rev j a goflin and located in aiken county south carolina it symbolizes the early desire of the negro to worship in a church of his own negro clergy now serve as spiritual leaders of over  million people the baptists compose the largest segment of this number a consequence of the white baptist allowance for negro slaves to enter the ministry other denominations worked among the slaves in the name of christianity but the added incentive of following the negro clergy gave impetus to the denominational attraction towards the baptist with the exception of the above cited slave code of mississippi it is a paradox of history that even as slaves prior to the civil war negroes enjoyed full fellowship in the white churches of the south some due to extraordinary talents and gifts in preaching pastored these mixed fellowships robert e semple in his book the history of the baptist in virginia wrote mr thomas armstead pastored the portsmouth church in virginia until  and resigned after his resignation the church declined greatly they then employed josiah bishop a black man of considerable talent to preach for them    however soon he resigned because of some objection among the membership william lemmon a man of color was then chosen and served until his death several years later the negro minister currently pastoring over  churches of all sizes and denominations today finds himself facing the problem experienced by josiah bishop now the problem is within his own church and among his own people some  of these churches are baptist consisting of approximately  members the omission here of other denominational problems is not meant to indicate that none exists on the contrary all negro churches in part are confronted with the fundamental dilemmas that are to be presented in this essay the baptist church and its clergy because of size and familiar church structure in negro life invites this appraisal of the dilemmas it presents the negro church is in the throes of a silent rebellion silent it is for no concerted voices are heard in many respects only the clergyman is able to recognize its movement the rebellion is undeniably clear to him for strangely enough it is exerted in his direction a recent seminar held for negro ministers at virginia union university brought to the forefront the basic unrest and insecurity faced by these men many of them from varying denominations related the tensions and internal conflicts that awaited their return the most interesting feature of the seminar was the sessions where problems were shared and solutions offered a stranger happening by chance upon these conversations would have concluded the gathering to be one of dictators planning to curtail insurrection in their respective countries this rebellion probably received its largest thrust in the years following world war ii prior to that time definite patterns were established that are primarily responsible for todays dilemmas to understand the negro church and its clergy an insight into the background of its leadership functions is necessary except in recent years churches required little of their minister in terms of education and training his role as a man of god was highlighted by his ability to arouse his listeners up to the pearly gates of heaven through vocal calisthenics deliberately calculated to provoke emotionalism he was able to hold them there his ability to do this beyond a questionable doubt served a very important need his emphasis was on the hereafter and the gospel that he preached was one of deliverance people suffering from the ills of segregation ill housing lack of opportunity and discrimination welcomed the therapeutic effect that this ministry gave them these ministers and the time that produced them rendered an invaluable service the release given people in the form of religion cast the ministers in the role of a practicing psychiatrist dr morris b tynes pastor of the monumental baptist church chicago in referring to this phenomenon stated if the negro had not been encouraged to shout on sunday he would be compelled by his tensions to shoot on monday this obvious exaggeration only points up the anxieties and frustrations that the ministry of the church succeeded in quelling and succeeded quite admirably such ministry produced the resulting transference towards the symbol of internal healing with little equivocation the negro clergyman held a secure grasp on the hearts of the people his voice was the medicine of hope and eventual deliverance this is not true today great social changes induced by the recent war found the negro making rapid transitions from his life of old employment multiplied managerial techniques and industrial procedures were found in defense factories and in the armed forces in effect the negro was freed from emotional frustrations to an awakening realization that the pearly white gates of heaven were nearer earth than first thought the minister was discovering that he faced each sunday an increasingly enlightened membership following the war the veterans gi bill of rights fha and other equators of progress gave to the negro church solid citizens who had etched a niche in the community of hope the inevitable consequences of this social evolution worked its way into throbbing church discontentment motivated by the antiquity of church dynamics and aggravated by the emotional overtones of the ministry a rebellion brewed within the form of this rebellion has many sides some rebels changed faiths which might account for the increasing negro pilgrimage towards catholicism others remained and developed their rebellion toward the negro clergy itself the rebellion is so quiet that even those who assist it are often unaware of its existence a cross section taken of the average  negro congregation is revealing it constitutes a picture of dramatic evolution today the trumpeting voice of the clergy is unheard unless it relates itself to this change if not observed and heeded damaging consequences will be felt the tragic consequence brought about by this rebellion is that both people and clergy deny themselves of the full measure of honest religious experience the minister of the evolutionized church whose voice and philosophy are not cognizant of these changes underestimates the loss of his power churches are known to suffer this ministry only out of respect to his person no assumption is made that they are universally ineffective many in spite of the rebellion are serving remaining needs that shall later be discovered the ministers reluctance to surrender to change is understandable ego is its mainspring it must be remembered that the leadership and power structure of the negro community was formerly and admittedly in the hands of its ministers they spoke acted and listened in behalf of the people the pulpit was the launching pad for community thrust however they now find themselves victimized by the success of their efforts the brighter day that was promised is approaching within this same community are now found lawyers doctors labor leaders teachers collegians and many other competent and enlightened negroes these persons through education and specialization are now adequately serving the increasingly complex needs of the community the beleaguered minister now is haunted by the knowledge that the diminishing emotional characteristics of the church have left him with more sound than substance too late for change he clings to and treasures the few voices that respond to his call for old time religion some churches have become so evolutionized that those who give vent to their feelings through shouting become victims of glares of disgust many suggest that such actions are indicators of  mental disturbances lord how far we have come the reasons for this radical change among churchgoers might be found in the progress of the negro himself the negro has achieved many of the rights formerly denied him to be sure he has not yet received full citizenship but his educational opportunities and achievements frequently have surpassed even his own dreams where once he peered hopefully into the swirling waters of democracy he now finds himself in the waters therefore the emotional holds of his religion have been released rightly or wrongly if the negro minister fails to recognize these factors or strives to maintain the multiplicity of tasks that were once his complete domain he strides into the teeth of the rebellion this silent rebellion within the church might be looked upon as the core of the national baptist convention inc conflict the seeds of division were sown in  when the struggle for power and position divided it into opposing camps the progressive baptists newly organized in  established their break on the claim that established leadership failed to respond to progress thus today baptists are faced with a threeheaded structure each contending for power and prestige these conventional separations offer the negro clergyman a frustrating look at his own congregation unrest dissatisfaction with procedure administrative weaknesses and the clinging vine of emotionalism constitute factors which have risen like yeast from local congregations to split the national bodies ministers who contend most fervently for change at the national level fail to realize they are only echoing the voices of their own congregations the congregations voice unlike his own is silent the blame for this failure of communication must be equally shared local congregations bewildered by the storms that erupt from their ministers at the national level have not recognized that the church itself created the tempest the silent conflict of pew and pulpit has found its catharsis in the conventions as the oldline negro christians make their departure through retirement and death they leave the negro church a mixed legacy it is this legacy that constitutes the dilemma facing todays minister who is fast discerning that he cannot escape his heritage the first problem facing the modern minister is the problem of preaching itself the negro church is a paradox even though the evolutionized church silently rebelled against the emotional service there remains the subconscious desire to experience it the minister who cannot arouse his listeners to occasional bursts of emotional experiences soon finds himself competing  unwillingly with those who can these competitors who learned the oldtime art of preaching from their fathers are eagerly sought for revivals and special services the people demand that he make the bible alive exciting and emotional this is the evoluaonized voice crying out for the past whether subconsciously or consciously the desire is there soaring to the heights of rhetorical beauty and using the voice as a painter would splashing a canvas with bright colors the minister surrenders to the past and increases his own dilemma when the local pastor is unable to satisfy these retrogressive moods once again silent rebellion sets in unfortunately many churches do not know what they want from their minister in regards to preaching churches become seriously divided in respect to the character of the minister desired large followings are found on both extremes when a minister accepts a call to a church of this divided nature the groundwork for rebellion is already laid it is noted that the dilemma of how to preach is ofttimes more of a concern to him than what to preach those who apply themselves to the concern of how consequently make a hollow mockery of their own talent the tradition of the pastors anniversary likewise rears up out of the past as one of the seeds of insurrection its original purpose was to honor the pastor by awarding him additional finances to supplement his meager salary money raised by membership taxation were ceremoniously presented to him on this big day as an expression of appreciation seated before the congregation with all of the pomp and circumstances afforded royalty he graciously received their gifts the original purpose was considered both honest and necessary when we consider the internal changes already notedthe diminishing emotional factor and the loss of ministerial influence resulting from the silent rebellionthe existence of the pastors anniversary today places a question mark behind both its honesty and necessity ministers who have an understanding of the psychology of their people have attempted to eliminate this tradition and in its place to obtain wages adjusted to the time in which he lives a recent salary survey taken among all clergymen shockingly revealed how the negro church values its ministry other ministers have discontinued the pastors anniversary because of the hostilities that arise from those who disagree with its purpose finally it has an additional shortcoming in that it subjects the minister to a yearly straw vote as to his popularity probably the most distressing rebellion in the negro church is the one occasioned by the official board of the church baptist churches have two traditional spiritual offices those of pastor and deacon the original calling of the deacons as found in chapter six of acts was to assist the apostles in the care of the membership in order to free the latter for preaching and study even the early church experienced a rebellion among its membership the evolution of society welfare agencies and socialization have now taken from the church many of the tasks and responsibilities of caring for the individual with the exception of sick visitations which are unfailingly required by and of the pastors deacons have been left with little external responsibilities yet as officers of the church and seeking recognition as such they seek and have found administrative authority on par with the minister many churches conscientiously grant them this authority the dilemma posed by this grant is awesome for the minister realizes that authority without responsibility is catastrophic he is faced with allowing such conditions to exist or firming his own authoritative powers neither condition is healthy he finds himself in the position of having to work with these men of varied backgrounds with opinions and personalities to match the variations these men convinced by tradition and urged on by members vie with the minister for administrative leadership if the pastor possesses  any degree of human frailty that is obvious to them they have the tendency to magnify it unfortunately in some churches such activity becomes the deacons sole raison detre as can be noted the consequences of this situation render both pastor and deacons ineffective for a full ministry in fact they have a tendency under these conditions to cancel each other out the apostles who initiated the deaconship would be horrified to learn that those who were called to help are actually watering the ground for the seeds of rebellion the minister is helpless to correct this situation without appearing autocratic an appeal to the people for release from this situation is useless after all the growth of the boards authority is the voice of their own rebellion facing the minister also are organizational structures and cliques which individually and collectively seek authoritative recognition and status circles and auxiliaries have created internal pastorates within their own groups and have successfully established a power structure add to this picture the members who deplore such infringements upon the church when the minister is unable or unwilling to challenge the trend of internal competing forces he is soundly blamed for allowing such conditions to exist thus the rebellion is complete facing the necessity of making choices in all these perplexing predicaments the minister recognizes that alternatives are equally conclusive against him however reflection upon his dilemma informs him that the integrity of his office and personality is at stake like paul two men war within him for the possession of his mind casting about in this religious sea the minister discovers the helm slipping from his grasp swirling around him are the angry waves of the rebellion and he realizes the old ship of zion is in peril unwilling to become a martyr to a cause that will not support itself through progress he wrestles with the desire to flee its consequences indeed ministers have been tempted to change professions for the maintenance of peace of mind the internal destructive elements in each crisis evokes additional terror to his very soul yet true to the code of the prophets many ministers hear the voice of god reminding them of responsibility and accountability as with the code of the sea the captain is the last to disembark from a sinking ship his primary responsibility is to the passengers it is here that we find the modern minister his position is not totally unbearable for he recognizes that he himself is a product of the ethnic centrifugal forces that are at work in the church he was born into the structure the ingrained and deeply rooted impulse that brought his religion to life cannot now by the same token be utilized to quiet the rebellion around him here he stands god help him he cannot do otherwise no other profession stands in such urgent need of solutions as that of the negro minister harking back to the code of mississippi in  it can be seen that negro ministers are not yet free from its prophetic stricture free negroes or mulattoes for exercising the functions of a minister of the gospel on conviction may be punished by any number of lashes not exceeding  on the bare back and shall pay the cost 
tootsie belle alaska
by clinton clark
bright summer sun y a  lit the scene below as    our little plane circled the village of flat alaska this nearly abandoned gold mining town lies midway between the yukon and kuskokwim rivers in an area of small mountains about  miles w m southeast of nome gold dredges have thoroughly torn up the countryside making it anything but a place of scenic beauty two dredges still remained one of which was still in operation we set our wheels down on an old landing strip at the edge of town with a mild assortment of uncomplimentary remarks we swatted mosquitoes beyond number as we walked up a pathway through small timber to the village store where we inquired our way to our destination moments later we paused at the door of a small  frame building alongside the door time had almost erased the letters which spelled the words tootsies tavern knocking on the door we were greeted by a little old lady who all of alaska knows and loves fighting her way over wilderness rivers and trails mrs martha crosby has forged her name on the pages of alaskan history her career has been a colorful one colorful in more ways than one for tootsie as she is known all over alaska is truly a colored lady black as night tootsie was born in maine in  the daughter of joe and susannah mcelhaney next to the baby in a family of  her father was a blacksmith after the death of her mother in  mr and mrs j d wade who had been friends of the family talked her father into giving tootsie to them to raise i just want a little colored child for an ornament mrs wade said very wealthy the wades spent most of their time traveling he was connected with the united fruit company their travels took them to many of the latin american countries and everywhere they went little tootsie also went but the call of alaska reaches far and eventually they turned their backs on the southern climes attracted by tales of gold and adventure they landed in skagway on september   traveling all over alaska and canadas yukon during the years that followed they found the adventure they sought tootsie last saw her foster parents in skagway in  they left a large amount of money for her in the bank of commerce in dawson recalling her early life with them tootsie says no white child was ever raised better than i was returning to seattle that same year tootsie married a colored man who worked in a hotel but the next day when he went to work she somehow got the idea that he had run off with her sister and some others and she took out for chicago and never saw him again while on the train she gained the acquaintance of a lady who was en route to take a stage test as a dancer accompanying her new found friend to the rehearsal tootsies feet could not be still and she  too started to dance the director said keep going keep going i thought he meant git out  tootsie said so i was a gittin out the door and a gittin out fast then he said no no i meant keep dancing  whered you learn to dance the director asked tootsie i dont know i guess i was just born that way did you ever hear of the amateur theater no well you go there thus began a year of stage dancing in chicago in  accompanied by a colored girl friend tootsie returned to alaska and the two women started stage dancing in iditarod a small village only a few miles from flat but this life was too confining for tootsie so she quit the dancing bought a gasolinepowered boat and went into business hauling freight and passengers between iditarod on the iditarod river and marshall on the yukon river all up and down the rivers she was greeted by eskimos who would run to their friends shouting theres a black white woman in town once she was confronted by an eskimo who exclaimed how come you more blackern us yet you talk like white woman other eskimos rubbed her hands to see if the black would come off staying at a road house she sat at the supper table and was given a very scornful look by an eskimo across the table i don t like you you been here all day and you aint washed your face yet on one trip she took a group of passengers from marshall to kotlik at the mouth of the yukon to catch a steamship but on arrival at kotlik the captain of the steamer refused to accept her passengers he said we will give you all the passengers you want for st michael so she took  more passengers and left for st michael despite their warning that they would not pay her if she did not get beyond romanof st michael is on norton sound across from nome just beyond romanof the little river boat got froze in and was marooned there until their food supplies were almost exhausted but patience won out and eventually they arrived at st michael on the return trip to kotlik they were caught in a storm and nearly sank when they left kotlik enroute to st michael one of tootsies crew members was told to bring back a supply of snuff and tobacco but he promptly forgot it on arrival back at kotlik tootsie faced a storm almost as bad as the one on the water one man told her i wish you had drowned weve been out of snuff for two weeks returning to iditarod tootsie opened a road house she cooked for  to  men alone days and days i never got a chance to go to bed she said handled whiskey too got pinched too  in those days gold was the magic word in alaska when you heard of a strike within  miles you just took your hat and a crust of bread and started right off across country the mail from outside was brought overland by dogteam road houses were few and far between they slept in the snow didnt carry no tent or nothin tootsie recalled they cooked mush on the trail for their dogs the prettiest thing in the world was to see the mail man a cornin with  or  dogs with their tails curled up and their little bells a ringin great big dogshuskies them was the kind of dogs to have i wouldnt have these little playthings they have now they cant haul nothin during the first world war tootsie boarded dogs in the summer time she averaged

the only man on liberty street 
by william melvin kelley
he was squatting in the s v front yard digging f with an old brass spoon  in the dirt which was an ocean to the islands of short yellow grass she wore a red and white checkered dress which hung loosely from her shoulders and obscured her legs it was early spring and she was barefoot her toes stuck from under the skirt she could not see the man yet riding down liberty street his shoulders  square the duster he wore spread back over the horses rump a carpetbag tied with a leather strap to his saddle horn and knocking against his leg she could not see him until he had dismounted and tied his horse to a small black iron negro jockey and unstrapped the bag she watched now as he opened the wooden gate came into the yard and stood looking down at her his face stern almost gray beneath the brim of his wide ha she knew him her mother called him mister herder and had told jennie that he was jennies father he was one of the men who came riding down liberty street in their fine black suits and starched shirts and large dark ties each of these men had a house to go to into which mostly in the evening he would disappear only women and children lived on liberty street all of them were negroes some of the women were quite dark but most were coffeecolor they were all very beautiful her mother was light she was tall had black eyes and black hair so long she could sit on it the man standing over her was the one who came to her house once or twice a week he was never there in the morning when jennie got up he was tall and thin and blond he had a short beard that looked as coarse as the grass beneath her feet his eyes were blue like jennies he did not speak english very well jennies mother had told her he came from across the sea and jennie often wondered if he went there between visits to their house jennie you ask your mother why i do not stay at night is so she looked up at him yes mister herder the hair under his jaw was not as light as that on his cheeks or on his head he nodded i stay now go and bring your mother she left the spoon in the dirt and ran into the house down the long hall dark now because she had been sitting in the sun she found her mother standing over the stove a great black lid in her left hand a wooden spoon in her right there were jewels of sweat on her forehead she wore a full black skirt and a white blouse her one waistlength braid hung straight between her shoulder blades she turned to jennies running steps mama that man my father he in the yard he brung a carpetbag first her mother smiled then frowned then looked puzzled a carpetbag darling yes mama she followed her mother through the house pausing with her at the hall mirror where the woman ran her hand up the back of her neck to smooth stray black hair then they went onto the porch where the man was now seated surveying the tiny yard and the dark green hedge that enclosed it the carpetbag rested beside his chair her mother stood with her hands beneath her apron staring at the bag mister herder he turned to them i will not go back this time no matter what why should i live in that house when i must come here to know what home is he nodded sharply as if in answer to a question so i stay i give her that house i will send her money but i stay here with you two so her mother stood silently for an instant then turned to the door dinnerll be on the table in a halfhour she opened the screen door the spring whined and cracked oh she let go the door and picked up the carpetbag ill tote this on up she went inside as she passed jennie could see she was smiling again after that jennies mother became a celebrity on liberty street the other women would stop her to ask about the man and he staying for good josie yes you have any trouble yet not yet well child you make him put that there house in your name you dont want to be no sissie markham that white woman come down the same day he died and moved she and her children right into the gutter you get that house put in your name you hear yes how is it it different her mother would look dazed yes it different he told me to call him maynard the other women were always very surprised at first jennie too was surprised the man was always there in the morning and sometimes even woke her up her mother no longer called him mister herder and at odd times though still quite seldom still said no she had never before heard her mother say no to anything the man ever said it was not long before jennie was convinced that he actually was her father she began to call him papa daily now a white woman had been driving by their house jennie did not know who she was or what she wanted but playing in the yard would see the white womans gray buggy turn the corner and come slowly down the block pulled by a speckled horse that trudged in the dry dust a negro driver sat erect in his black uniform a whip in his fist the white woman would peer at the house as if looking for an address or something special she would look at the curtained windows looking for someone and sometimes even at jennie the look was not kind or tender but hard and angry as if she knew something bad about the child then one day the buggy stopped the negro pulling gently on the reins the white woman leaned forward spoke to the driver and handed him a small pink envelop he jumped down opened the gate and without looking at jennie his face dark and shining advanced on the porch up the three steps which knocked hollow beneath his boots opened the screen door and twisted the polished brass bell key in the center of the open winter door her mother came drying her hands the negro reached out the envelop and her mother took it looking beyond him for an instant at the buggy and the white woman who returned her look coldly as the negro turned her mother opened the letter read it moving her lips slightly then jennie could see the wet twinkling at the corners of her eyes her mother stood framed in the black square of the doorway tall fair the black hair swept to hide her tears her eyes glistening jennie turned back to the white woman now and saw her lean further into her seat then suddenly  she pulled forward do you understand what i will have them do she was shouting shrilly and spoke like jennies father you tell him he has got one wife you are something different she leaned back again waved her gloved hand and the buggy lurched down the street gained speed and jangled out of sight around the corner jennie was on her feet and pounding up the stairs mama go play jennie go on now play still her mother stared straight ahead as if the buggy and the white woman remained in front of the house she still held the letter as if to read it the corners of her eyes were twinkling and wet then she turned and went into the house the screen door clacked behind her at nights now jennie waited by the gate in the yard for her father to turn the corner walking in the beginning she had been waiting too for the one day he would not turn the corner but each night he came ¦ that day seemed less likely to come even so she was always surprised to see him when she saw him she would wave timidly raising her hand only to her shoulder wiggling only her fingers as if to wave too wildly would somehow cause the entire picture of him advancing to collapse as only a slight wind would be enough to disarrange a design of feathers that night too she waved and saw him raise his hand high over his head greeting her she backed away when he reached the gate so he might open it her head thrown way back looking up at him well my jennie what kind of day did you have she only smiled then remembered the white woman a white lady come to visit mama she come in a buggy and give her a letter too she made mama cry his smile fled he clicked his tongue angry now we go see what is wrong come he reached for her hand her mother was in the kitchen she looked as if she did not really care what she was doing or how walking from pump to stove stove to cupboard in a deep trance the pink envelope was on the table she turned to them her eyes were red several strands of hair stuck to her temples she cleared her nose and pointed to the letter she come today her father let go jennies hand picked up the letter and read it when he was finished he took it to the stove and dropped it into the flame there was a puff of smoke before he replaced the lid  he shook his head she cannot make me go back josephine her mother fell heavily into a wooden chair beginning to cry again but she white maynard he raised his eyebrows like a priest or a displeased school teacher your skin is whiter my mother was a slave he threw up his hands making fists your mother did not ask to be a slave then he went to her crouched on his haunches befor her speaking quietly no one can make me go back but she can get them to do what she say she turned her gaze on jennie but looked away quickly you wasnt here after the war but i seen things i seen things happen to field niggers that    i was up in the house they didnt bother me my own father the general he stood on a platform in the center of town and promised to keep the niggers down i was close by she took his face in her hands maynard maybe you better get on back leastways i go backdead you hear dead these children these cowardly children in their masks will not move me i go back dead that is all we do not discuss it and he was gone jennie heard him thundering down the hall knocking against the table near the stairs pounding up to the second floor her mother was looking at her now her eyes even more red than before her lips trembling her hands active in her lap jennie  yes mama she took a step toward her staring into the womans eyes jennie i want you to promise me something and not forget it yes mama she was between her mothers knees felt the womans hands clutching her shoulders jennie youll be right pretty when you get grown did you know that promise me youll go up north promise me if im not here when you get eighteen youll go north and get married you understand jennie was not sure she did she could not picture the north except that she had heard once it was cold and white things fell from the sky she could not picture being eighteen and her mother not being there but she knew her mother wanted her to understand and she lied yes mama repeat what i just said she did her mother kissed her mouth hard the first time ever from the kitchen below their voices came her fathers voice sounded hard cut short jennie knew he had made a decision and was sticking to it her mother was pleading trying to change his mind it was july the fourth the day of the shooting match she dressed in her sunday clothes and coming downstairs heard her mother maynard please dont take her she was frantic now im begging you dont take that child with you today i take her we do not discuss it i take her those sneaking cowards in their masks    jennie knew now what they were talking about her father had promised to take her to the shooting match for some reason her mother feared there would be trouble if jennie went downtown she did not know why her mother felt that way except that it might have something to do with the white woman who continued to ride by their house each morning after her father had left for the day perhaps her mother did not want to be alone in the house when the white woman drove by in her gray buggy even though she had not stopped the buggy since the day two months ago when the negro had given her mother the pink envelope but other strange things had happened after that in the beginning she and her mother as always before had gone downtown to the market to shop amid the bright stalls brimming with green and yellow vegetables and brickred meats tended by dark country negroes in gay clothes and large straw hats it would get very quiet when they passed and jennie would see the negroes look away fear in their eyes and knots of white men watching sometimes giggling but the white women in fine clothes were the most frightening sitting on the verandas or passing in carriages some even coming to their windows they would stare angrily as if her mother had done something terrible to each one personally as if all these white women could be the one who drove by each morning her mother would walk through it all her back straight very like her fathers the bun into which she wove her waistlength braid on market days gleaming dark in the beginning they had gone to the suddenly quiet market but now her mother hardly set foot from the house and food was brought to them in a carton by a crippled negro boy who was coming just as jennie and her father left the house that morning balancing the carton on his left arm he removed his ragged hat and smiled morning mister herder good luck at the shooting match sir his left leg was short and he seemed to tilt her father nodded thank you henry i do my best then you a sure thing mister herder he replaced his hat and went on around the house walking her hand in her fathers jennie could see some of the women of liberty street peering out at them through their curtains downtown was not the same flags and banners draped the verandas people wore their best clothes the square had been roped off a platform set up to one side and new marsails avenue which ran into the square had been cleared for two blocks far away down the avenue stood a row of cotton bales onto which had been pinned oilcloth targets from where they stood the bullseyes looked no bigger than red jawbreakers many men slapped her father on the back and furtively looked at her with a kind of clinical interest but mostly they ignored her the celebrity of the day was her father and unlike her mother he was very popular everyone felt sure he would win the match he was the best shot in the state after everyone shot the judge came running down from the targets waving his arms maynard herder six shots and you can cover them all with a good gob of spit he grabbed her fathers elbow and pulled him toward the platform where an old man with white beard wearing a gray uniform trimmed with yellow waited she followed them to the platform steps but was afraid to go any further because now some women had begun to look at her as they had at her mother the old man made a short speech his voice deep but coarse grainysounding and gave her father a silver medal in a blue velvet box her father turned and smiled at her she started up the steps toward him but just then the old man put his hand on her fathers shoulder people had begun to walk away down the streets leading out of the square there was less noise now but she could not hear the first words the old man said to her father  her fathers face tightened into the same look she had seen the day the letter came the same as this morning in the kitchen she went halfway up the stairs stopped the old man went on you know im no meddler everybody knows about liberty street i had a woman down there myself    before the war i know that the words came out of her fathers face though his lips did not move the old man nodded but maynard what youre doing is different shes your own daughter maybe thats why    the old man looked down the street toward the cotton bales and the targets but shes a nigger and now the talk is taking an ugly turn and the folks talking are the ones i cant hold her father spoke in an angry whisper you see what i do to that target you tell those children in their masks i do that to the forehead of any man  or woman that comes near her or my house you tell them maynard that wouldnt do any real good after theyd done something to her he stopped looked at jennie and smiled thats my only granddaughter you know his eyes clicked off her youre a man who knows firearms youre a gunsmith i know firearms too pistols and rifles can do lots of things but they dont make very good doctors nobodys asking you to give her up just go back home thats all go back to your wife her father turned away walking fast came down the stairs and grabbed her hand his face was red as blood between the white of his collar and the straw yellow of his hair they slowed after a block paused in a small park with green trees shading several benches and a statue of a sternfaced young man in uniform carrying pack and rifle we will sit she squirmed up onto the bench beside him he was quiet for a long while the warm wind smelled of salt from the gulf the leaves were a dull low tambourine finally he sighed leaned forward to get up but first thrust the blue velvet box into her hand it was cool and almost prickly i give it to you it is yours always remember i give it to you he stood now you must go home tell your mother  come later that night jennie tried to stay awake until he came home until he was there to kiss her goodnight his whiskers scratching her cheek but all at once there was sun at her window and the sound of carts and wagons grating outside in the dirt street her mother was quiet while the two of them ate after breakfast jennie went into the yard to wait for the gray buggy to turn the corner but for the first morning in many months the white woman did not jounce by peering at the house searching for someone nr something special

 erdition catch my p soul but i do love thee    fetch me   the handkerchief    v beware my lord of jealousy it is the greeneyed monster    then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well the gorgeous rhetoric and fearful tension of shakespeares othello the moor of venice have enthralled three and a half centuries of players and audiences the worlds finest actors have delighted in the challenges of the roles of the bighearted gullible othello and the malicious iago theatergoers find it particularly satisfying when a negro portrays the harassed moor it certainly is the greatest role ever written for an african in the s paul robeson played othello with jose ferrer as iago for several prosperous seasons in the s william marshall headed the brattle troupe of cambridge mass which took othello to new york ira aldridge the eminent th century american actor is often called the first negro to play othello but this is not quite correct when aldridge was a boy in new york james hewlett and several fellow players organized the african company which staged othello and other shakespeare plays there was quite a movement for drama and general education among new york negroes in those days when george washington was president the african free school was established even before a free school for white children was available ira aldridge probably was graduated from that school and from the hewlett company the facts pertaining to his early career are obscure a candidate for an advanced degree in theater history could write a valuable book about him if he or she were willing to undertake long research ira was born about  his grandfather was said to have been chief of a senegalese tribe who was assassinated by his subjects for advocating an exchange of prisoners the kings son daniel escaped with the aid of an american missionary and made his way to new york eventually daniel became pastor of a new york congregation and sent his son ira to schenectady n y to prepare for the ministry but the boy had developed a taste for the theater from his school activities and soon returned to new york to take backstage jobs when ira was  and working as a stage carpenter he was befriended by a man of influence some historians believe that the friend was the greatest english ac tor of his time edmund kean who was acting in new york around  others assert that the benefactor was james wallach a prominent manager of new york and london theaters at any rate aldridge was taken to london and presented in othello when he was only  the critics and paying customers received him so favorably that he was starred in the theaters of the capital and of the provinces for many years he was frequently billed as the african roscius roscius was a slave who become the most famous actor of ancient rome and incidentally a millionaire aldridge himself was never a slave and strangely he never acted in the united states as a mature professional he came back to new york a time or two but never could make a satisfactory deal with the managers actually his european successes were more than sufficient he was rapturously received not only as othello but as lear macbeth hamlet shylock and richard iii just about the greatest characters ever created by shakespeare he also starred in plays that are almost forgotten now pizarro the revenge the slave the padlock and others he revived one of shakespeares lesser plays titus adronicus so that he could take the role of aaron the moor his othello remained his best role however and it was unmatched anywhere at that time the journalists reported that the audiences wept shouted and shuddered at his interpretation maria malibran a great singing actress of opera declared never in the whole course of my professional career have i witnessed a more powerful and interesting performance after one performance a leading english playwright sheridan knowles rushed up to him flung his arms about the actor and shouted for the honor of the human race let me embrace you the reception of the american on the european continent was equally ecstatic one of his admirers was the greatest of german opera composers richard wagner who had a prodigious knowledge of theater in general he wrote a friend for your attention wednesday othello with ira aldridge tickets should be secured early in those continental performances aldridge spoke english and the other actors used the language of the particular nation in which they appeared evidently an understanding of his speech was not necessary at a berlin performance the german actress playing desdemona became so alarmed that she screamed and ran from the stage wherever he went aldridge was a box office magnet an announcement of his forthcoming appearance resulted in an advance sale of many thousands of tickets he played for five solid months in berlin and received  a week plus expensesan enormous stipend for that era he received decorations and honorary orders from kings dukes and other nobles the king of prussia this before the united german empire was formed awarded him the national gold medal of science and art only three celebrities had received it previously humboldt the naturalist spontini the composer and liszt the pianistcomposer aldridge became a british citizen and made his home in upper norwood his villa there was literally crammed with gifts and decorations a visiting reporter observed a leading french author and critic theophile gautier considered aldridge the finest actor of the midth century he saw aldridge in russia and wrote he was the lion of st petersburg now leningrad it was necessary to engage seats far in advance his entrance as othello was magnificent the frenchman continued with his eyes half closed as if dazzled by the african sun he was othello himself he had that nonchalance that oriental attitude that freedom of movement possessed by a negro which no european can imitate he created an immense effect and received endless applause after his first performance in st petersburg the theatergoers unhitched his horses and pulled his carriage through the streets gautier considered aldridges lear even better than his othello white paint covered his cheeks and a thick white beard enveloped the rest of his face even his fellow players could not have guessed he was a negro although he was at the height of his physical power he did not betray by a single movement that he was a younger man his voice step and gestures were all those of an english king  years old many other critics wrote of him with equal enthusiasm a reviewer in the large polish port city of danzig called him the greatest dramatic artist we have ever seen a vienna journalist declared that aldridge is without doubt the greatest actor that has ever been seen in europethis in vienna a traditionally great center of theatrical activity aldridge was twice married his first wife a wealthy english woman had met him when she went backstage tc congratulate him after her death he married a swedish countess amanda pauline brandt three children were born to them their daughter amanda studied singing under the immortal jenny lind the swedish nightingale and became a prominent voice teacher in london among her pupils were the famous american negro singers robeson and roland hayes aldridge died in lodz poland in his early sixties he was stricken by a heart attack just as he was winding up his european tour and preparing to make a tour of his native landa land never privileged to see him act

n august  a  dutch manofwar anchored off the coast of virginia twenty frightened sick negroes were pulled out of the steaming hold and quickly rowed to shore they were the first african slaves sold in english america the captain mistakenly believed that slaves were his only cargo he had no barrels of rum no agricultural tools no bolts of cloth to put off the negroes carried no baggage they had left all the material manifestations of their culture in africa what the captain didnt know is that a secondary cargo had been secretly stowed away on the shipa cargo that was locked in the minds of all the slaves it was composed of human ideas and traditions one of the stowaways was the african belief that slavery was a natural state of affairs since time immemorial the african negroes had been enslaving each other in fact the new world negroes had been run down and sold to the europeans by some of their own people a few of the newlyarrived slaves had themselves owned slaves in africa therefore it should come as no surprise to know that barely fifty years after the first negroes touched the coast of virginia a few managed to free themselves and become the masters instead of the mastered until now the history of the negros role as slave master has been largely neglected in this country it hasnt been for lack of material evidence the archives of our country contain abundant references to this practiceenough to keep researchers busy for years there are three main reasons why the public has not been made conscious of this little known sidelight on american history first the original writers on the subject said that most of the colored slave masters became such for philanthropic reasonsin order to free or protect their own people it is true that many negro freedmen owned members of their own families such as wives children and parents however in this authors opinion personal emotional motives rather than genuine philanthropy inspired the purchase of close relatives the records prove that few freedmen manumitted slaves outside the immediate family circle there are only a few instances of genuine philanthropy among negro freedmen john barry meachum a negro baptist minister who lived in the early th century purchased negroes and allowed them to earn their freedom on liberal terms in  samuel gibson a mississippi negro took his six slaves to cincinnati ohio and settled them on free territory however such philanthropy was rare not enough to release the american negro from his share of guilt the truth is that an uncomfortable percentage of free negroes hungered for property in slaves they bought as many as they could afford and acquired a reputation as hard frugal efficient task masters other historians have wrongly exaggerated the importance of the old laws restricting freedmen on the books they were quite oppressive it appeared that the freedmen could acquire true freedom only by going north in florida their lot was so intolerable that many asked to be returned to slavery however in most slave states the laws against freedmen were intolerable only in theorynot in actual practice they were drawn up to provide legal ground for the whites in case the freedmen got out of hand such laws generally made life impossible for vagrants and the unemployed before the outbreak of the civil war more than fifty per cent of all free negroes lived in the south those who were skilled in the trades or had other special talents had more work than they could handle arkansas and florida appear to be the only states where private enterprise among the negroes was seriously curtailed even so some negroes in those states managed to buy and hold property in their own people others have discounted the importance of negro slaveholding on the grounds that relatively few of them owned slaves in comparison with the whites this is true however the fact that they did it when able and that several of the largest slaveholders in the old south were negroes proves that many american negroes had an appetite for slaveholding and enthusiastically contributed to its perpetuation many negroes used to sit on the spacious porches of their luxurious plantation homes drinking mint juleps and watching their slaves toil endlessly under the blistering southern sun such masters acquired good educations sent their children to the best european schools and went north not to escape but to vacation and purchase items for their plantations in a journey in the seaboard slave states frederick olmstead wrote an intelligent man whom i met at washington who had been travelling most of the time for two years in the planting districts of louisiana having business with planters told me the free negroes of the state in general so far as he had observed were just equal in all respects to the white creoles there were many opulent intelligent and educated the best houses and most tasteful grounds that he had visited in the state belong to a nearly fullblooded negroa very dark man he and his family are well educated and though french is their habitual tongue they speak english with freedom and one of them with much more elegance than most liberally educated whites in the south they had a private tutor in their family   as stated at the beginning of this article some negroes freed themselves and acquired slaves just a few decades after their arrival in the new world about the middle of the th century several negroes had become free owners of land there was at least one who owned a negro servant who went to court for his freedom he was turned down because he could not produce the indenture that he claimed to have in his possession one of the first notations in the deed books of st augustine florida is that of joseph sanchez a colored carpenter he sold francisco p sanchez a negro slave for  the connecticut historical society has in its files at hartford connecticut a bill of sale from samuel stanton of stonington connecticut dated october   to prince a free negro born of a slave woman named binar on the other side is a bill of sale from prince to isaac denison stonington august   of the same binar a slave according to the records most free negroes as soon as they acquired sufficient money purchased mates and other close relatives many of the negro husbands who bought wives did not liberate them immediately they preferred to put them on trial for a few years if they proved to be unsatisfactory they were sold proof that not all the free negroes were philanthropic is the wealth of cases where members of the family were sold for profit by their own children or parents c d wilson in an article about negro slaveholders negroes who owned slaves popular science monthly nov  tells the story of a free negro named jacob who managed to purchase his father at a reasonable price all went smoothly for a while until  one day his father scolded him he was so angered that he sold his father to a negro speculator the trader sent his father south  young jacob afterward boasted that the old man had gone to the corn fields about new orleans where they might learn him some manners  the negro slaveholders acquired their status by inheritance through white relatives by gifts and by purchase after the manner of their caucasian neighbors some negro tradesmen and businessmen accepted property in slaves as payment for services rendered in  antoine robert robin de longy contracted a free mulatto to build the famous mansion destrehan now owned by the panamerican oil co it is one of the oldest houses in louisiana the terms of the contract read as follows robert antoine de longy and charles free mulatto have agreed    that the said charles carpenter woodworker and mason by his trade obligates himself to construct  a home of sixty feet in length by thirtyfive feet in width    for the sums and price mentioned hereafter    one brute negro with a cow and her calf    fifty quarts of rice in chaff fifty quarts of com in husks and one hundred piastras term applied to the dollar the negro masters owned generally from one to a dozen slaves others ruled the lives of  to more than  men women and children negro slave owners were to be found in all the colonies or states where slaves were kept in many counties the negro masters were numerous in others they were unknown olmstead in a journey described places in louisiana where white slaveholders were the minority there are also in the vicinity a large number of free colored planters in going down cane river the dalmau called at several  of their plantations to take on cotton and the captain told me that in fifteen miles below natchitoches he did not know but one pureblooded white man the plantations appeared no way different from the generality of those of the white creoles and on some of them were large handsome and comfortable houses these free colored people are all descended from the progeny of old french or spanish planters and their negro slaves such a progeny born before louisiana was annexed to the united states and the descendants of it are entitled to freedom   wilson in his investigations received the following letter from the hon phanor breazeale of natchitoches louisiana   assuming that the records of the parish are a fair criterion by which to judge the other old parishes of the state it was not an uncommon feature of slavery to find that free blacks owned slaves but on the contrary there were prior to the war quite a number of free colored people as they were called who were owners of slaves some of these free colored people in this parish were quite wealthy    the records here disclose sales to and from free colored people of slaves i do not recall any instances in examining the records of having found a case where a free black owner voluntarily manumitted his slaves  as a matter of interest in studying this phase of slavery i have found by inquiry from old people that free black owners were as a usual thing much more severe on their slaves than the white owners mr d c scarborough of natchitoches wrote wilson    the truth of the matter is that free blacks owned bought and sold slaves as did the whites the succession of c n roques in this parish is a case in which a free black owned some hundred or so slaves all of whom were freed by the proclamation of emancipation melrose plantation near natchitoches la was founded by a congolese negress named marie therese coin coin marie was brought to america when she was a small child upon the death of her master she was freed and awarded a large grant of land by the french government the beginnings of her fortune were derived from the forest lands on the plantation after the supply of suitable trees was exhausted she turned to the soil her haitian husband augustin metoyer was a leading slaveholder and philanthropist in the natchitoches community augustin and marie owned more than a hundred slaves and helped the poor people who lived on the banks of the cane river one of augustins gifts to the community was a church on isle breville across the river it is still in use augustins food was served on expensive china he slept on a large four poster bed all of his children had personal servants and his wife managed a large group of maids and houseboys the plantation house melrose manor is now a famous tourist attraction and haven for artists it is in excellent condition and is said to be one of the most beautiful plantation homes in the south it was built by augustins grandson louis metoyer jr in the first half of the th century there were many negro slaveholders in the natchitoches area their descendants live there still many on the same lands that were owned by their slaveowning grandfathers the homes of many natchitoches colored people contain priceless relics and memoirs of their illustrious ancestorsof a day when negroes owned negroes the following extract from the plaquemine louisiana sentinel  tells the story of a rich negro who did not know the meaning of philanthropy  a wealthy negro family  an immense estate in louisiana embracing over four thousand acres of land with two hundred and fifty negroes belonging to the plantation was recently sold for a quarter of a million dollars the purchaser was a free negro who is said to be one of the wealthiest men of the south the above is from a new york paper and refers to the harrison property which was purchased by cyprian ricaud a free man of color of our parish if the property had contained as many acres as stated above and as many slaves it would have brought nearer a million and a quarter than a quarter of a million on the contrary the land we believe comprised some sixteen hundred acres and there were about one hundred slaves of all sizes it lies in the rear of madame ricauds plantation and the two plantations now owned by that family probably do comprise the number of acres of land and slaves as above stated making them doubtless the richest black family in this or any other country the accusation that the black hand of the black master was the crudest was frequently heard throughout the south olmstead in the cotton kingdom wrote    a negro with whom the author was talking in that regionin answer to further inquiries said that there were many free negroes all about this region some were very rich he pointed out to me three plantations within twenty miles owned by colored men these bought black folks he said and had servants of their own they were bad masters very hard and cruelhadnt any feeling you might think master dat dey would be good to dar own nation but dey is not i will tell you de truth massa i know ise got to answer and its a fact dey is very bad masters sar id rather be a servant to any man in de world dan to a brack man if i was sold to a brack man id drown myself dough i shouldnt like to do dat nudder but i wouldnt be sold to a colored master for anything   this writer does not believe that the bulk of black masters were as cruel as the whites and negroes of that time declared slaves were a valuable investment the free negroes had to make more sacrifices to acquire slaves than the whites did like all property owners they were probably anxious to protect and increase their investments the whites naturally would have been shocked to see a negro punishing another negro as had to be done occasionally as is the case with slavery it was necessary for the masters even black masters to be harsh with their erring servants many prejudiced whites who wanted proof that nigger would out everytime naturally searched for traces of savagery in the freedmen it was probably damaging to a negros vanity to have to be the  slave of someone of his own kind prestige factors were probably involved the observation of a northern traveler in texas before the civil war printed in the journal of negro history vol  pg  intimated the real reason why negroes hated to be owned by members of their own race at another house where we stopped  we heard some conversation upon a negro of the neighborhood who had been sold to a free negro and who refused to live with him saying he wouldnt be a servant to a nigger    some observers have however written that there were many kind negro slave owners c d wilson wrote mr stevenson archer of mississippi states that he knew a pureblooded negro born free by name nori a corruption of le noir who had before the civil war a large plantation in mississippi and owned about one hundred negroes he was exacting but not cruel and he took excellent care of his slaves such a master was william johnson a rich negro slave owner of natchez mississippithe famous barber of natchez in his diary he writes of a beating he administered to one of his slaves steven got drunk last night and went off and remained all night and was not here this morning to go to market i sent bill nix to the jail to see if he was there and he was not there i then sent him out to dr obdons and in going there he found him and brought him down and left him in the gate and he jumped over the fence and went threw in judge montgomerys yard bill he ran around the corner and found him and brought him in i kept him in the shop a little while and then sent him to the house belonging to bill hazard he ran off  times in about three hours and bill nix caught him every time so he brought him home after a while and i went to the stable and gave him a pretty sefveere thrashing with the cow hidethen he was perfectly calm and quite and could then do his work tis singular how much good it does some people to get whiped steven got so bad that johnson was finally forced to sell him south although they never attained the same social status as their white contemporaries most of the successful freedmen were accepted as nearequals william johnson the famous barberbusinessman of natchez was respected by all the whites of that city when he was killed the local newspapers eulogized him the news of his death was talked about as far away as new orleans regardless of the restrictions upon them negro freedmen were usually treated fairly in business and in the courts an example of their right to get the protection of the courts is the following will and  testament of a negro freedman from caroline county maryland last will and testament of ricksum webb negro recorded in will record waf no a fol  et sq directs that my servant jerry shall serve my son james for the period of ten years after death of testator and then to be free to be given fifty dollars a year during this service and suitable clothing should jerry abscond from service and be taken to be sold for life to the highest bidder in lieu of this service to be sold to a resident of maryland for not less than  for a period of ten years and then to be free said jerry to have choice of purchasers servant luke willed to soninlaw eben hughes servant asbury to be free at age of  years girl servant ann to be free at age of  james turner of queen annes executor will dated  may  proven th march  before william a ford register of wills for caroline county when president lincoln signed his famous emancipation proclamation he reduced many colored freedmen to poverty along with the white slaveholders the negro slaveholders even more than the whites hated to see the end of slavery they knew that once the slaves were free they would be sucked down into the black maelstromand lose all their status the negro slaveowners knew that they could preserve their dignity only while slavery remained an institution in the south abolition was repugnant and unthinkable to them therefore most of the slaveowning freedmen refused to surrender their property in human beings instead they rallied to the cause of the confederacy a group of colored proprietors who owned slaves as a production investment sent a joint communications to the new orleans daily delta dec   when secession and war were impending the free colored population native of louisiana    own slaves and they are dearly attached to their native land    and they are ready to shed their blood for her defence   they have no sympathy for abolitionism no love for the north but they have plenty for louisiana    in  e s dargan forwarded to george w randolph confederate secretary of war the following letter from g huggins cleveland of mobile sir i can raise a battalion of regiment of creoles who are mixed blooded    they are mostly property holders owning slaves and a peaceable orderly class and capable of doing good service they are as true to the south as the pure white race    after the war was over slavery was snuffed out in the united states the negro masters reluctantly freed their slaves worked their lands themselves or looked negro digest march  for other occupationsand sank into tragic obscurity wilson wrote of a colored man named dubroca who lived until  near mobile alabama who had been the owner of numerous slaves not long before his death a white acquaintance met him on the streets and asked him how he felt he replied o i am feeling poorly i am getting old they all tell me it was a good thing to free the negroes but i wish i had my niggers back once more wilson also wrote of a negro named james fitzgerald who grieved himself to death over the results of the war by which he lost his slaves the ownership of slaves wasnt the only heights that free negroes attained in the slave states many writers like to impress us with accounts of the negroes progress in the last hundred years or so in this writers opinion the story of negro progress in a slave environment is much more impressive the mystery of how so many thousands of slaves could have thrown off the shackles of bondage rising head and shoulders above both races in a society designed to smother not nurture negro individuality is a phenomenon that defies belief not only did many become rich planters and slaveholders but there were doctors architects businessmen clergymen poets writers artists and skilled tradesmen among them the free negroes of new orleans during the antebellum period attained the highest degree of financial success and the highest level of general culture attained by a similar racial group anywhere in the world the amazing history of the progress of the american negro in the slave states is a super american success story making horatio alger appear weak lifeless and lacking in ambition it is an immortal national epic that preaches a dramatic message not only to the whites and negroes of america but to all the peoples of the world the fact that the spirit of free enterprise and personal achievement cropped up in the negroes in spite of all efforts to keep it suppressed and that previously enslaved men and women rose to dizzy heights proves that the desire for individual achievement is as fundamental as hunger and thirst the freedmen showed the world that there is something indomitable about the mortal yearning and striving for individual achievement their dusky faces staring out at us from the pages of history the old court records and what remains of their plantation homes are testimony to what men can do if they possess sufficient energy and determination while their role as slaveholders was deplorable the energy and sacrifice it took to acquire them are badly needed ingredients in modern society they also proved that a race that can surmount such tremendous obstacles may be a lot of the things people say it isbut inferior it aint 
before the mayflower
by lerone bennett jr
came out of a violent storm with a story no one bes v lieved a name no one recorded and a past no one investi£ gated she was manned by pirates and thieves her captain vs cd was a mystery man named jope her pilot an englishman named marmaduke her cargo an assortment of africans with sonorous spanish namesantony isabella pedro a year before the arrival of the celebrated mayflower  years before the birth of george washington  years before the signing  of the emancipation proclamation this ship sailed into the harbor at jamestown virginia and dropped anchor into the muddy waters of history it was clear to the men who received this dutch man of war that she was no ordinary vessel what seems unusual today is that no one sensed how extraordinary she really was few ships before or since have unloaded a more momentous cargo from whence did this ship come from somewhere on the high seas where she robbed a spanish vessel of a cargo of africans bound for the west indies why did she stop at jamestown the first permanent english settlement in america no one knows for sure the captain ptended john rolfe noted that he was in great need of food he offered to exchange his human cargo for victualle the deal was arranged antony isabella pedro and  other africans stepped ashore in august  the history of the negro in america began it began in a way with antony and it began with a love story antony who had no surname fell in love with isabella and married her isabella in  gave birth to the first negro child born in english america the proud parents named the boy william tucker in honor of a local planter there were other ships other william tuckers other antonys and other isabellasmillions after millions this is a story about those millions and the way they came to the americas this is a story about the merchandising and marketing of human beings this is a story about the greatest migration in recorded history the story of antony and isabella is only an act in a larger drama the european slave tradewhich began in  and continued for more than  years during this period africa lost an estimated lorty million people some twenty million of these men and women came to the new world millions more died in africa during and after their capture or on the ships and plantations these figures though instructive do not say anything meaningful about the people involved the slave trade was not a statistic however astronomical the slave trade was people living lying stealing mur  dering and dying the slave trade was a black man who stepped out of his hut for a breath of fresh air and ended up ten months later in georgia with bruises on his back and a brand on his chest the slave trade was a black mother suffocating her newborn baby because she didnt want him to grow up a slave the slave trade was a kind captain forcing his suicideminded passengers to eat by breaking their teeth though as he said he was naturally compassionate the slave trade was a bishop sitting on an ivory chair on a wharf in the congo and extending his fat hand in wholesale baptism of slaves who were rowed beneath him going in chains to the slave ships the slave trade was a greedy king raiding his own villages to get slaves to buy brandy the slave trade was a pious captain holding prayer services twice a day on his slave ship and writing later the famous hymn how sweet the name of jesus sounds the slave trade was deserted villages bleached bones on slave trails and people with no last names the slave trade was caesar negro angelo negro and negro mary above all the slave trade was captain tomba who came to america and nealee who didnt nealee started out but she couldnt or wouldnt make it she was being driven to the west african coast for sale when she became ill and refused to walk another step mungo park who was one of the last persons to see nealee said she was put on an ass but the ass was so very unruly that no sort of treatment could induce him to proceed with his load and as nealee made no exertion to prevent herself from falling she was quickly thrown off and had one of her legs much bruised every attempt to carry her forward being thus found ineffectual the general cry of the coffle slave caravan was kangtegi kangtegi cut her throat cut her throat an operation i did not wish to see performed and therefore marched onwards with the foremost of the coffle i had not walked above a mile when one of karfas the leader domestic slaves came up to me with poor nealees garment upon the end of his bow and exclaimed nealee affeeleetanealee is lost i asked him whether the slatees black slave merchants had given him the garment as a reward for cutting her throat he replied that karfa and the schoolmaster would not consent to that measure but had left her on the road where undoubtedly she soon perished and was probably devoured by wild beasts captain tomba who came to america was first seen in a slave pen in sierra leone john atkins a surgeon who saw him there said he was a handsome man who scorned looking at us refusing to rise or stretch out his limbs as the master commanded a few days later captain tomba and a companion led a revolt on a slave ship and killed three sailors before they were subdued what happened to captain tomba why says john atkins captain harding weighing the stoutness and worth of the two slaves captain tomba and a companion did as in other countries they do by rogues of dignity whip and scarify them only while three others abettors but not actors nor of strength for it he sentenced to cruel deaths making them first eat the heart and liver of one of them killed the woman he hoisted up by the thumbs whipped and slashed her with knives before the other slaves till she died captain tomba living nealee dying john newton praying the king of barsally stealing the fat bishop baptizing captain harding torturing these people and millions like them made the slave trade one of the darkest chapters in the history of man this dark chapter started in the fifteenth century but in truth it goes back to the dawn of history slavery in one form or another has been practiced in every country known to man it was old when moses was young in platos athens and caesars rome menwhite black and brown menwere bought and sold slavery existed in the middle ages in christian europe and in pagan africa in the ancient world almost anyone might become a slave slavery was so prevalent in fact that it was not considered a badge of shame the israelites milton r konvitz reminds us in the promised land did not consider it a badge of shame that their forefathers had been slaves unto pharaoh in egypt on the contrary they were commanded to hold ever in their consciousness not only the fact that they had been led out of their bondage in egypt but also and with equal importance that before the exodus they had been slaves slavery then like alienage could serve as a bond to humanity    the experience of slavery in the ancient world was so common that plato ventured to suggest that every man has many slaves among his ancestors ciceros letter to atticus forms a curious comment on the changing fashions in race do not obtain your slaves from britain he wrote because they are so stupid and so utterly incapable of being taught that they are not fit to form part of the household of athens a charming story which revolves around this letter was recounted by the distinguished britisher sir william hamilton fyfe the incident he said happened in sierra leone a lecture had been arranged    and the lecturer took the line that the weight and structure of an africans brain was such that it was quite incapable of being developed by higher education he thought his audience was wholly european but when the time for questions came at the end there rose at the back of the hall a tall ebony figure with that wide and winning african smile it was one of the members of the staff of the old and famous missionary college at fourah bay he thanked the lecturer very kindly for his interesting talk and he said you know it reminded me of what i happened to be reading last night in a volume of ciceros letters it was a letter that was written by cicero to his friend atticus the millionaire employer of slave labour and he says in the letter that of all his slaves the british were the ugliest and most stupid and then he added ingratiatingly how you have come on and with that he sat down there was a crucial difference between ancient slavery and modern slavery ancient slavery which had little or nothing to do with race was justified primarily by the rules of war christians and moslems added a new dimension to this ancient institution members of each faith historian kenneth m stampp writes looked upon the other as infidels and hence felt doubly entitled to make slaves of the other when taken as captives moors captured in north africa and in the spanish peninsula were held in bondage in italy spain portugal and france christian prisoners suffered the same fate in the lands of islam christians and moslems alike believed it just to hold heathens in servitude and both found victims among the negroes of africa the moslems got there first for several centuries before the opening of the european trade moslem merchants dragged dark captives across the hot sahara sands then in the fifteenth century portugal diverted this trade to the atlantic the prime mover in this development was a devout covetous prince named henry the navigator excited by stories of the great wealth of africa and asia he ordered his ships to explore the coast of africa there on a fateful day in  henrys men came upon the first large group of africans they tiptoed through the high grass and crept to the edge of the village and then said a contemporary they looked towards the settlement and saw that the moors with their women and children were already coming as quickly as they could out of their dwellings because they had caught sight of their enemies but they shouting out st james st george portugal attacked them killing and taking all they could and at last the chronicler continued our lord god who giveth a reward for every good deed willed that for the toil they had undergone in his service they should that day obtain victory over their enemies as well as a guerdon and a payment for all their labour and expense for they took captive of those moors what with men women and children  besides those that perished and were killed    the pious portuguese captured seventy more africans including a girl they found sleeping in a deserted village and sailed home the captives were promptly baptized and enslaved within ten years portugal was importing one thousand africans a year a century later negroes outnumbered whites in some sections of portugal there was a big demand for negro domestics stevedores and agricultural laborers especially in the southern section by the middle of the sixteenth century says mary wilhelmina williams the inhabitants of the algarve were largely ethiopians and even as far north as lisbon blacks outnumbered whites there was no marked color line and the blood of the two races mingled freely resulting eventually in negroid physical characteristics in the portuguese nation christopher columbus and sugar made the slave trade a big business descendants of the first negro slavesblack christians born in spain and portugalwere among the first settlers of the new world negro explorers servants and slaves accompanied french spanish and portuguese explorers in their expeditions in north and south america they were with pizarro in peru cortes in mexico and menendez in florida thirty negroes were with balboa when he discovered the pacific ocean some authorities believe a negro made the first trip they say pedro alonso nino who piloted one of columbus ships was a negro among the outstanding negro explorers in the new world was estevanico who opened up new mexico and arizona for the spaniards other negroes w e b dubois says accompanied desoto and one of them stayed among the indians in alabama and became the first settler from the old world spaniards who took the lead in the exploration attempted at first to enslave indians but they died out so fast that bishop bartolome las casas a famous missionary recommended in  the importation of africans las casas lived to regret this recommendation the development of largescale sugar planting gave the slave trade a cruel twist in a few years droves of negroes were crossing the atlantic each year and the soil of africa america and europe was drenched with their blood strange says eric williams that an article like sugar so sweet and necessary to human existence should have occasioned such crimes and bloodshed an estimated million of these negroes found their way to the land that became the united states of america but the first black immigrants antony isabella and the jamestown groups were not slaves this is a fact of capital importance in the history of the american negro they came these first black men the same way that many perhaps most of the first white men cameunder duress and pressure they found a system indentured servitude which enabled poor white men to come to america and sell their services for a stipulated number of years to planters under this system thousands of whitespaupers neerdowells religious dissenters waifs prisoners and prostitutes were shipped to the colonies and sold to the highest bidder some were sold as the first negroes were sold by the captains of ships some were kidnapped on the streets of london and bristol as the first negroes were kidnapped in the jungles of africa in virginia then as in other colonies the first negro settlers fell into a wellestablished socioeconomic groove which carried with it no implications of racial inferiority that came later but in the interim a period of forty years or more the first negroes accumulated land voted testified in court and mingled with whites on a basis of equality they owned other negro servants and at least one negro imported and paid for a white servant whom he held in servitude negro and white servants kenneth stampp says seemed to be remarkably unconcerned about their visible differences they toiled together in the fields fraternized during leisure hours and in and out of wedlock collaborated in siring a numerous progeny the racial situation at this juncture was fluid it contained the seeds of several alternatives indentured servitude could have continued for negro and white servants or both groups could have been reduced to slavery other possibilities were indian slavery and a free labor system for negroes and whites indians and immigrants socioeconomic forces selected negro slavery out of these alternatives in the west indies sugar was decisive in america tobacco and cotton were the villains a worldwide demand for these products and the rise of plantationsized units to meet this demand focused attention on the labor force how could men be forced to work the rulers of the early american colonies were not overly scrupulous about the color or national origin of their work force indian slavery was tried and abandoned many masters attempted to enslave white men and white women when these attempts failed the spotlight fell on the negro he was tried and he was found not wanting why were negroes more acceptable than poor whites and poor indians white men for one thing were under the protection of strong governments they could appeal to a monarch white men moreover were white they could escape and blend into the crowd indians too could escape they knew the country and their brothers were only a hill or a forest away another element in the failure of indian slavery was the fact that indians tended to sicken and die negroes did not have these disadvantages they were strong one negro the spanish said was worth four indians they were inexpensive the same money that would buy an irish or english indentured servant for ten years would buy an african for life they were visible they could run but they could not blend into the crowd above all they were unprotected and the supply unlike the supply of irishmen and englishmen seemed to be inexhaustible the rulers of early america fell to thinking why not virginia and maryland led the way in the s laws made negroes servants for life intermarriage was forbidden children born of negro women were ruled bond or free according to the status of the mother at first religion was the rationalization negroes were good material for slavery because they were not christians between  and  the basis shifted to race virginia said it first in her law of    the conferring of baptisme doth not alter the condition of the person as to his bondage or freedom after that it was easy a series of laws stripped the negro slave of all rights of personality and made color a badge of servitude the negro population which had grown slowly during the twilight interim of freedom lunged forward by  the number had increased to  when the declaration of independence was signed there were  by  the twenty negroes who landed at jamestown in  had become  where did these people come from how did they come why did they come most of the negro slaves came from an area bordering a mile stretch on the west coast of africa they came chained two by two left leg to right leg from a thousand villages and towns they came from many racial stocks and many tribes from the spirited hausas the gentle mandingos the creative yorubas from the ibos efiks and krus from the proud fantins the warlike ashantis the shrewd dahomeans the binis and sengalese some slaves were captured in native wars and sold to slattees black slave merchants who sold them to europeans some were kidnapped by europeans and africans some were sold into slavery for infractions of native laws driven by slattees some captives made forced marches of  miles to the coast where they were examined like cattle and packed into the holds of slave ships they came on these forced marches across rivers and over mountains barefooted and naked to their enemies with chains on their ankles burdens on their heads and fear in their hearts were theythese people who gave to the world the american negro were they the dregs of society no the strong came and the weak too priests princes warriors merchants and nobles came slave traders testified that it was not unusual for an african to sell an african today and to be captured and sold himself tomorrow the story is told of a slave merchant who sold a parcel of slaves and unwisely accepted a social drink to seal the transaction one drink led to anotherand to america the slave merchant woke up the next morning with a hangover and a brand on his chest he was in the hold of a slave ship with his victims and over him stood the captain laughing to beat the band this story underlines a rather obvious fact africans as well as europeans were involved in the slave trade there has been a systematic attempt however to overemphasize the degree of african involvement the picture of a whole continent of africans kidnapping and selling each other for rum guns and gewgaws is wide of the mark it is true that some africans corrupted by europes insatiable desire for human flesh sold their countrymen but many africans like king almammy and captain tomba loathed the whole business and forbade their subjects to take part in it european nations fought each other for the privilege of managing the trade portugal who ran the first leg was ousted by holland who in turn surrendered supremacy on the african coast to france and england portugal one trader said served for setting dogs to spring the game once the game was sprung all europe rushed to the playing field spain barred from africa by a papal bull which gave her most of the new world made her money by giving other powers a contract to supply her colonies with slaves this contract the infamous asiento was the national status symbol of that day it symbolized commercial and political supremacy in the eighteenth century when england held the asiento the slave trade was the basis of european commerce the cause of most of her wars and the prize politicians competed for an intricate set of trading arrangements existed on the guinea coast the west coast of africa for processing africans bought and stolen europeansfrench swedish danish portuguese dutch english and prussian tradersdotted the coast with a series of forts and factories each fort and factory had a dungeon or negroe house where slaves were confined until shipment into these factories europeans poured a steady stream of goods colorful cloth trinkets rum and other strong water blankets old sheetswhich were converted into human beings europeans operating as representatives of powerful companies or as private traders bartered these goods for men and women a woman might change hands for a gallon of brandy and six beads a man might bring eight guns a wicker bottle two cases of whiskey and twentyeight old sheets slaves were purchased from brokers at the forts and factories or in open markets john barbot a famous trader has described an open market on the slave coast as the slaves come down to fida from the inland country they are put into a booth or prison built for that purpose near the beach all of them together and when the europeans are to receive them they are brought out into a large plain where the surgeons examine every part of every one of them to the smallest member men and women being all stark naked such as are allowed good and sound are set on one side and the others by themselves which slaves so rejected are there called mackrons being above thirtyfive years of age or defective in their limbs eyes or teeth or grown grey or that have the venereal disease or any other imperfection these being so set aside each of the others which have passed as good is marked on the breast with a redhot iron imprinting the mark of the french english or dutch companies  in this particular care is taken that the women as tenderest be not burnt too hard the newlypurchased slaves properly branded and chained were rowed out to the slave ships for the dreaded middle passage across the atlantic they were packed like books on shelves into holds which in some instances were no higher than eighteen inches they had not so much room one captain said as a man in his coffin either in length or breadth it was impossible for them to turn or shift with any degree of ease here for the six to ten weeks of the voyage the slaves lived like animals under the best of conditions the trip was intolerable when epidemics of dysentery or small pox swept the ships the trip was beyond endurance on many of these ships a contemporary said the sense of misery and suffocation was so terrible in the tweendeckswhere the height sometimes was only eighteen inches so that the unfortunate slaves could not turn round were wedged immovably in fact and chained to the deck by the neck and legsthat the slaves not infrequently would go mad before dying or suffocating in their frenzy some killed others in the hope of procuring more room to breathe men strangled those next to them and women drove nails into each others brains it was not unusual john newton said to find a dead and living man chained together so many dead people were thrown overboard on slavers that it was said that sharks would pick up a ship off the coast of africa and follow it to america all negroes did not come this way there was a trickle of free immigrants from the west indies and some black men and women got on boats in africa and paid their way to america in  for example the governor of georgia issued a certificate to fenda lawrence a free black woman and heretofore a considerable trader in the river gambia n on the coast of africa who hath voluntarily come to be and remain for some time in this province the certificate gave miss lawrence  permission to pass and repass unmolested within the said province on  her lawful and necessary occasions fenda lawrence of course was an exception most negroes came in chains followed by wise and greedy sharks the survivors of this gruelling ordeal were sold either on the ships or in slave markets in american ports in new england where there was a large retail demand slaves were sold in taverns stores and warehouses some were shown as the ads put it in the merchants homes some slave merchants sold negroes and whites liquor clothing and other goods one merchant for example advertised several irish maid servants timemost of them for five years oneirish man servant one who is a goodbarber and wiggmakeralso four or five likely negro boys the price of men like the price of butter fluctuated george washington for example bought a man slave for  in  but when he went to the market ten years later he had to pay  slaves were sold for small down payments and on reasonable terms an advertisement of  noted that the buyer shall have    or  months credit there was also a mailorder business one new englander noted in his diary that i wrote mr salmon of barbadoes to send me a negro the human factories in africa struggled to keep up with the demand in the eighteenth century between  and  negro slaves crossed the atlantic each year the greatest number by far went to the west indies and brazil at least two million were shipped to the west indies joao pandia calogeras the brazilian historian said at least eighteen million were shipped to brazil arthur ramos another brazilian thinks this figure is too high five million he says is a more accurate estimate large blocks of slaves were dropped off in spanish colonies in the caribbean and in central and south america as early as  there were twenty thousand negroes in mexico some  slaves were imported before slavery was abolished in mexico in the first quarter of the nineteenth century hundreds of thousands of slaves were scattered over the areas of presentday panama colombia ecuador chile peru and venezuela in  venezuela had some  negroes in a total population of  in  there were  negroes in cuba and only  whites in the same year there were  negroes in brazils population of  more than  of the brazilian negroes incidentally were free widespread amalgamation and unreliable census data make it difficult to assess the impact of these millions of south american life but in some south american countries people with negro blood still comprise a considerable proportion of the population what gilberto freyre the brazilian sociologist and philosopher said of brazil is true for a great part of the new world every brazilian even if he is light skinned and has fair hair bears in his soul    the shadow or the mark of the native or the negro of the negro particularly on the seaboard from maragnan to rio grande in the south and in the state of mines the influence of the african is direct or vague and remote in our way of expressing tenderness in our excessive mimicry in our catholicism which is a delight of the senses in our way of walking and talking in the songs which cradled our childhood in short in all the sincere expressions of our life the negro influence is patent for the human chattel involved the slave trade was a stupendous roulette wheel the boats fanned out from africa and scattered human freight over the western hemisphere around and around the wheel went stopping here and there sealing wherever it stopped the fate of mothers and fathers and their children to the nth generation it made a great deal of difference to the slaves where the dice of fate fellwhether they landed for example in a country where the word was the spanish yo or the french je or the english i slavery to be sure was a form of hell wherever it existed but there were gradations of hell dantesque circles as it were within circles by all accounts the britishprotestant colonies were the deepest pit the roman catholic colonies especially the portuguese and spanish colonies were by comparison relatively mild the french and spanish could be cruel and often were but they did not seem to be driven by the same demons that pursued the puritans they did not for example interfere as much in the personal lives of the slaves in the roman catholic countries african religious practices and other elements of african culture were not as vigorously opposed as they were in the protestant colonies the protestant colonies with an instinct for the jugular vein rode herd on tomtoms and joyful noises unto the lord the difference this made in social cohesion is roughly the difference between the successful haitian revolution and the abortive nat turner insurrection the final meeting of the haitian revolution was held at a vodun ceremony and the signal went out by tomtoms another difference minor perhaps but important to the people involved was the texture of the different societies the catholic countries were gay and colorful the protestant colonies by comparison were a dull shade of grey more important was the relative absence of color prejudice in spanish america and portuguese brazil this fact gave a certain tone to social intercourse and the life of a slave in these colonies was less hopeless and unhappy than the life of a slave in say south carolina in brazil there was a state officer a protector of slaves who looked after the welfare of the disadvantaged manumission was easier in brazil and spanish america and a manumitted slave inherited the rights and privileges of citizens there were several ways in which a slave could win freedom if he could earn his purchase price he could walk up to his master and hand him the moneyand the master had to accept it he could earn money on sundays and religious holidays another means of salvation was childbearing if slave parents had ten children in hispanic america the whole family went free the difference between hispanic america and protestant america reduces itself as so many racial problems do to the problem of sex for reasons that are not entirely explicable the spanish and portuguese were willing to marry negroes in america white men drew the line at marriage that is in america in the french english spanish dutch and danish colonies the slaves were given a new conception of themselvesaccording to the different lights of their captors this process whether it took place in liberal brazil or harsh south carolina was a painful mindreversing operation in which two or three out of every ten died in one form or another every slave from africa went through a breakingin period during this period which varied from one to three years the slave was taught pidgin english or french or spanish he got a new name and began to look at himself and others in a different manner yahweh took the place of olorum legba became st peter the mass or hymnal replaced voodo the strain was too much for tens of thousands some died from old and new diseases some refused to give up shango and wasted away others ran away and died of exposure still others committed suicidedrowning was popular in liberal brazil charles s johnson has given an excellent description of the breakingin process in south carolina in the early days of the plantation regime when a gang of fresh africans were purchased they were assigned in groups to certain reliable slaves who initiated them into the ways of the plantation these drivers as they were called had the right of issuing or withholding rations to the raw recruits and of inflicting minor punishments they taught the new slaves to speak the broken english which they knew and to do the plantation work which required little skill  at the end of a year the master or overseer for the first time directed the work of the  new negro who now had become tamed assigning him to a special task of plantation work along with the other seasoned hands who had long since learned to obey orders to arise when the conch blew at day clean to handle a hoe in listing and banking to stand still when a white man spoke the merchandising and marketing of men made millioinaires in england and america and many people shared in the profits on the eve of the american revolution says dr lorenzo j green it the slave trade formed the very basis of the economic life of new england about it revolved and on it depended most of her other industries the vast sugar molasses and rum trade shipbuilding the distilleries a great many of the fisheries the employment of artisans and seamen even agricultureall were dependent upon the slave traffic liverpool in england newport in rhode island nantes in france prospered as slave trading centers it was a common saying eric williams reports that several of the principal streets of liverpool had been marked out bv the chains and the walls of the houses cemented by the blood of the african slaves and one street was nicknamed negro row the red brick customs house was blazoned with negro heads the story is told of an actor in the town who hissed by the audience for appearing before them not for the first time in a drunken condition steadied himself and declared with offended majesty i have not come here to be insulted by a set of wretches every brick in whose infernal town is cemented with an africans blood  the western world williams contends is in danger of forgetting today what the negro has contributed to western civilization    london and bristol bordeaux and marseilles cadiz and seville lisbon and new england all waxed fat on the profits on the trade in the tropical produce raised by the negro slave capitalism in england france holland and colonial america received a double stimulation from the manufacture of goods needed to exchange for slaves woolen and cotton goods copper and brass vessels and the firearms handcuffs chains and torture instruments indispensable on the slave ships and on the slave plantation    this contribution of the negro has failed to receive adequate recognition it is more than ever necessary to remember it today england and france holland spain and denmark not to mention the united states brazil and other parts of south america are all indebted to negro labor africans helped build liverpool nantes and newport they helped finance the industrial revolution in england they helped clear the forest in america they did these things but they protested every step of the way protests began in africa where mutinies on ships were common and continued in america where revolts were common the negroes captain thomas phillips said are so willful and loth to leave their own country that they have often leapd out of the canoes boat and ship into the sea and kept under water till they were drowned to avoid being taken up and saved by our boats which pursued them they having a more dreadful apprehension of barbadoes than we can have of hell tho in reality they live much better there than in their own country but home is home etc   home being home etc many slaves revolted brained the captain and crew and escaped to the shore rebellions on ships were so common that a new form of insurance was introducedinsurrection insurance many slaves refused to eat when well and refused to take medicine when ill one man for instance attempted to cut his throat after the wound was sewed up he ripped out the sutures with his fingernails he was patched up again but refused to eat and died ten days later of starvation in the west indies and on the mainland there were many revolts a long series of conspiracies and revolts culminated in the great haitian revolution which played an important part in the abolition of the trade pushed by fear of the unmanageable slaves and pulled by humanitarian motives stemming from the american and french revolutions politicians abolished the trade in the nineteenth century it continued surreptitiously however until the final abolition of slavery in the united states the slave trade left a bloodstained legacy during the four centuries the trade was pursued it wrecked the social and economic life of africa set tribe against tribe and village against village the trade was no less disastrous in europe and america where it left a legacy of ill will and guilt and a potentially explosive racial problem raphael painted w e b du bois has said luther preached corneille wrote and milton sang and through it all for four hundred years the dark captives wound to the sea amid the bleaching bones of the dead for four hundred years the sharks followed the scurrying ships for four hundred years america was strewn with the living and dying millions of a transplanted race for four hundred years ethiopia stretched forth her hands unto god
