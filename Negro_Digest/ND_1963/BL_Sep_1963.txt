wht e supremacya dead ly disease
by howard seals
white supremacy is irrational in a manner and degree constituting mental illness white supremacy in practice constitutes psychotic behavior it is a mass delusion it is an ethnic psychosis fixed on the delusive veneer of skincolor and it is axiomatic in the curing of mental illness that cure can only be effected in those cases where the patient wants to get well the social psychosis of white supremacy is not a negro problem but a problem of distortions in the minds of white  t people negroes at best involvement can only aggravate the social consciences of white people into an awareness and confrontation with the illness of white supremacy negroes themselves can never solve the race problem simply because they do not cause the problem negroes do not formulate the bases for the practice of racial discrimination nor do they continue and perpetuate the practices of racial supremacy it is not the negros problem but the problem of white people it is white people who must confront and solve the problem negroes can only perform the incidental tasks of helping white people to recognize the problem the final solution must come from whites alone so long as white people fail or refuse to recognize the problem any gains achieved by the negro minority will only be temporary and will eventually be lost in a relapse to former conditions of racial oppression some form of the irrationalities inherent in the separate but equal delusion continues to dement white people as it has for centuries despite the supreme court decree which held separate but equal to be inherently unequal in earlier times this delusion was articulated as the white mans burden in which an enlightened divinely favored white people undertook the burden of leading their savage and pagen black brothers to divine salvation it was held that these accursed people were to be enslaved for their own betterment the slave uprisings insurrections  and the civil war debunked the presumptions of the white mans burden and so it was rephrased as separate but equal separate but equal was codified by the united states supreme court in  in the case of plessy v ferguson and was finally overturned  years later in the  supreme court decision today separate but equal has been recast in what seems best summarized as the concept lead your people it is tragically ironic that todays recasting of separate but equal was presaged in justice harlans dissent from the majority opinion in the aforementioned case of plessy v ferguson it is significant that while justice harlan appeared to be exceptionally liberal courageous and egalitarian in his dissenting opinion yet in the context of the very same dissenting opinion he affirmed his belief in race pride in this dissent he wrote    every true man has pride of race and under appropriate circumstances when the rights of others his equals before the law are not to be affected it is his privilege to express such pride and to take such action based upon it as to him seems proper    mr justice harlan while appearing to be just was merely rephrasing separate but equal what he failed to understand is that any pride which is based on qualities thought to be inherent in one race necessarily implies an inferior inheritance in other races today the race pride which justice harlan affirmed as valid is now devolving into the delusive attitude of lead your race it is now contended by the most liberal and apparently responsible white people that great progress has been made that vast opportunities have opened up for negroes and that it is now only a matter for negroes to lead and prepare their people to fill the positions of opportunity it has been the speciously proud boast of white liberals to cite the example of a ralph bunche a carl rowan or a james b parsons as proof of what a prepared negro can achieve but in actual truth the preparedness of ralph bunche should have caused him to be elected president of the united states carl rowan should have become a senator from his home state of tennessee james b parsons is sorely needed as governor of the state of illinois neither of these men has the slightest chance of attaining a position comparable to his merits essentially a negro must still as it were train himself for the position of officemanager in order to someday work up to the job of officeboy the slow progress in solving the problems of racial oppression has been compared to a brick wall that is being taken down brick by brick this analogy is also apt in illustrating the insidious and recidivistic import of gradualism for while one white hand is showily removing one brick from the wall of segregation the other hand is clandes tinely putting up another brick and because this new obstruction is clandestinely placed in effect it is two bricksit must first be detected and established as existing before the task of its removal can begin this is the insidious duplicity of gradualism if an everincreasing series of obstructions are to be placed in the negros path to equality then it is intended that racial equality will never be attained after struggling year after year some negroes have gotten fair employment practice acts passed by their state legislatures only to discover subsequently that these fep laws were being circumvented by the subterfuge of using coded symbols on employment applications restrictive covenants in housing were once quite blatantly explicit but now that legislation has made such restrictions punishable by law the restrictive covenant is implied in legal catchphrases or not stated at all in the gentlemans agreement negro parents have fought long and diligently to have their children integrated into other schools to escape the overcrowded schools in allnegro neighborhoods only to find that the whites move out of the school district to cause what has been termed resegregation if the path to equality is to be an infinite series of obstacles then it is futile for negroes to attempt to surmount them all it is then futile to hope for and place trust in the good faith and cooperation of white people negroes can then only place hope and trust in themselves apart from and distrustful of white people accumulating evidences of perpetual deceit by white people will force negroes into concluding that they cannot succeed in appealing to the conscience of the white man and the nonviolent resistance which has heretofore been characteristic of negroes will have to be abandoned moreover negroes must then give greater emphasis to the fact that their aims must not be limited to gaining equal opportunity with whites because white people are quite inhuman to other whites to be treated equally with whites would still entail an unbearable amount of oppression of the human spirit white people must come to realize how deeply racism has distorted and continues to distort for them the totality of human life in experiences of earliest childhood in things of apparently trivial significance and extending to matters of universal significance the distortions of racism are present throughout the entire range of experience for a white person it pervades nursery stories such as little black sambo or brer rabbit and the tarbaby racism is to be noted in the ideas that a white dress worn by a woman denotes purity while black dress denotes sexiness or immorality angelfood cakes are whitedevilfood cakes are  chocolate colored in television commercials washing powders are not to produce cleanliness in clothing it is whiteness that is to be desired and white shoepolish does not take off scuff marks but put on the white while it takes off the black at the other extreme is the distortion of trying to fit the very dignity of god into a white skin myths of christianity imply that god was so pure in his whiteness that he immaculately fathered a son by a virgin white woman it is undeniable evidence of racial madness that in order to give a racial morphism to the supreme being white men would contradict his perfection by imputed acts of fornication and bastardy but these are the unembellished circumstances of the myth no matter how immaculate god was not married to the virgin mary and christ was left to be supported by a foster father joseph to state such a view concerning christianity may be regarded as abominable but the abomination is to be charged to the racial obsession which imputes such shame to god in the crises of school integration in the state of louisiana white mothers turned out en masse with their babies in their arms to spit out epithets and literally spit at the negro children it is a tragic paradox that such mothers were expressing their fears that their children would somehow be scarred or defiled by attending school with negro children poignantly the small white children terrorstricken whimpering in their mothers arms gave testimony that these mothers were themselves scarring the souls of their own children in a way that no child of any kind could do to another child only the involutions of psychic derangement could make a mothers breast so blind to the pain in a child pressed so closely to it much of the rightwing conservative movement or superpatriotism of today is covert racial fanaticism while purporting to be concerned with fighting communism they seek to impeach chief justice earl warren ostensibly for his part in decisions overturning several convictions of communists they would have it appear incidental that earl warren was also chief justice in the supreme court school desegregation decisions of  the rightwingers purported to be champions of liberty for moise tshombe in the congo condemning the united nations allegedly for intrusion into the internal affairs of the congo they would have it appear that their condemnation had nothing to do with the united nations having thwarted the conspiracy of white industrialists in the congo that much of archconservatism is actually racial conspiracy in disguise is clearly illustrated by the recently provided record of one such superpatriot namely edwin a walker former general edwin walker was the commander of the federal troops which forcefully brought about integration of schools in little rock arkansas as a white southerner from texas walker seems to have regarded his role in arkansas as a betrayal of his race and when reassigned to a command in germany he sought to atone for this betrayal by becoming a superpatriot after resigning from the army walker embarked on a course of demagoguery which culminated in his activities in oxford there in mississippi he indicated what was troubling him so sorely in his own words    i was on the wrong side in arkansas  i am on the right side in mississippi    the psychotic distortions of racism are resulting in a kind of irresponsible behavior which is critically effecting the ability of this nation to endure the very heart of democracy the exercise of individual liberty is being made into a mockery by the dissemblances of racial conspiracy the dixiecrats in the united states senate have through the filibuster made the right of unlimited debate become an unworkable legislative system and if the right of unlimited debate is to be discarded then democracy will not survive long after rabid southernersgovernors mayors and police chiefs have wilfully and repeatedly violated the law of the land and have said outright to hell with the constitution such treasonable attitudes and insurrective actions are a much clearer and much longer present danger to the overthrow of this government than the threat of any foreign power racism is pervading and becoming compounded in all facets of american life the socalled northern liberals are concocting all manner of legalistic labyrinths and parliamentary chicanery to stymie or fritter away racial progress northern newspapers handle news concerning negroes in a manner that is inflammatory dishonest and shockingly jingoistic they often use the news of the racial troubles in the south to obscure the racial treacheries perpetrated in their own states white liberal writers have published volume after volume on the civil war in the specious attempt to make the confederacy and robert e lee into legends of national glory and heroism only a psychosis focused on racism could attempt to invert such dishonor and shame into legends of national glory and pride to point up and dramatize the national shame and dishonor caused by racial bigotry negroes have suffered arrests beatings firehoses police dogs bombings arson shootings lynchings and murder the great courage forbearance and resolution of negroes has clearly shown that it is not among the minds of negroes that the blind wild hatreds of racism are produced they have clearly shown that it is among the minds of whites  that the fears blind hatreds and distorted humanity of racism are produced even the black muslims could not come close to such madness though they have attempted to emulate white supremacy negroes cannot allay or explain away the hatreds and fears of white people only white people themselves can expunge from their minds the irrationalities which so severely distort their lives the groups which can be most easily infiltrated and incited to violence in this nation are groups of rabid racists a foreign enemy of this nation needs only have a white skin and words of racehate to win immediate and complete acceptance into the ranks of the racist mobs the most blindly irrational and the most obsessively irresponsible group of people threatening this nation are the white americans who in order to maintain racial tyranny will shout to hell with the constitution this nation was founded on the belief that all humans are created equal and this belief must not be violated or compromised lest the nation lose its foundations    and to limit human worth to the superficial bounds of skincolor does not define a superior kind of humanity it defines something quite the opposite the behavior fomented by racism reduces humans to packs of wolves and never results in respect for the individual liberty necessary for democratic life 
keeping the record straig

the fundamental appeal in my review of lomaxs book the negro revolt was for adherence to simple canons of truthfulness and accuracy in reporting the negro revolt erred grievously and profusely in this regard and my review took sharp note of a number of serious misstatements and distortions it also noted a number of what i called unnecessary if minor errata which i attributed to editorial laxity on the part of the publishers i agree with lomax that his business is writing books not editing them and my reference to these errors made this plain i must add however that most authors whom i know cannot forbear a final peep at the galleyproofs in the expectation that some mistakes may have slipped in and in the hope that what comes out over their names will be as near perfect as possible lomax is quite mistaken incidentally in assuming that i was assigned to write that review i had an advance copy of the book and was thus the first person on our staff to read it it appalled and outraged me and i wrote the review on my own the review has evidently appalled and outraged lomax but his reaction would be more soundly based if he showed any sign of having read it with care he misquotes a reference to himself for example as a selfasserted naacp board member but this is not what i wrote the actual text was selfassertedly an active member and its purpose was to express surprise that under those circumstances he should be so ignorant of what the naacp does i am no longer so charitable however i think lomax does know but that for reasons of his own he prefers to ignore it lomaxs account of the naacps participation in the southern regional councils voter education project is typically garbled it was expected and desired that the association having the most experience in voter registration work should contribute heavily to the design and structure of the project to this end a careful evaluation of the prospectus was made by several of our staff executives and many of the suggestions they offered were subsequently incorporated into the vep plan no final commitment could be made except by vote of our board of directors the plan was not far enough advanced to permit this at the april  policy meeting and it was therefore considered at the next policy meeting in september  there was no delay intentional or otherwise and lomaxs fictitious quotation from an unidentified board member is gratuitous incidentally lomax professed at the time to believe that huge sums of money were instantly at hand and were being kept out of useful circulation only by naacp procrastination he was also wrong as to the amounts involved they were less than he claimed but being in honor bound by the sponsors to refrain from any public comment we could not speak freely about this or other aspects the sponsors be it noted were perturbed as we were over lomaxs premature radio broadcast which they regarded as mischievous and irresponsible in point of fact it took from september  until march  to obtain a ruling from the treasury department which would permit the vep funds to be channeled to the naacp and others who do not enjoy the right to receive taxexempt money it would be unfortunate in the extreme if criticism of the naacp were frightened off as lomax suggests continuous criticism is important one would hope it could be constructive even from lomax but any kind is better than none at all at the same time it seems to me the critics should adopt the same attitude and be prepared for countercriticism for correction and for refutation where these are in order this is the essence of healthy debate and it is not helped when giveandtake is interpreted as invidious personal attack a thick skin is still an important requirement for those who would be involved in controversy 
are negroes pushing too fast

ecalling her days r y as a canteen director  in world war ii margaret halsey tells of a new york soldier who often tried to talk with his southern buddies about the race problem somewhat baffled by the results he concluded wryly that on this touchy topic there were just two southsthe silent south and the screaming south the picture of course was never that simple nor the poor poor southas a beaten slaveholder once sadly called itever quite that sick not all of it anyway but while those two souths of miss halseys soldier are still painfully with us it is today two other souths one white and one negro that now play the dominant roles in the regions ongoing racial dramathis bruising and bitter struggle that is bound to affect americas integrity welfare and peace of mind for generations to come one of these newer souths symbolized for many by the forceful dr martin_luther_king jr consists of the impatient growing host that many fearful whites call those pushing negroes these are the rightsdemanding rebels the picketing freedomriding sittingin demonstrators the wallbattering suitfiling crusaders whose blazing fervor recalls the prayer of the old english preacher o lord we beseech thee to guide us aright for we are very determined on the other side arrayed in cool but stubborn opposition stand many of the souths betterclass whites a privileged raceproud elite who too upset to keep silent and too wellbred to scream are venting some pretty unhappy thoughts in grim and often biting language these are the staunch polite determined conservatives of varying shades of outlook and influence who might be termed the gentler standpatters one snowy moonlit night some months ago as we sat before a big log fire in his pleasant pinepaneled den i had a long quietlyrambling talk with one of these troubled white southerners an attractive keen young business man with a college degree he has generously poured out time money and energy in many kinds of public service for both races he has only pity and scorn for the ku klux klan yet there was no mistaking his deep dismay over the bold new spirit of todays fighting negroes and the weapons they use in the steppedup battle to wipe out racial discrimination i think negroes nowadays are making a big mistake he protested when they let the naacp and all these agitators fire them up into pushing so hard and so fast for their rights dont they see what they are throwing away they can keep on fighting this bitter social war if they choose and they probably willbut by golly it isnt going to make our white people love them any better and countless vexed and anxious whites all across the old confederacy are voicing similar plaints as one of my neighbors warmly put it the worst of it is that all this pushing is undermining good race relations and setting back the clock of progress for a generation or more but is it really as a lifelong cardcarrying white southerner i beg to differ as to their strategy and methods let me say i hold no brief for all that todays militant negroes now do and say their leaders obviously are not infallible just because they are underdogs any more than all rankandfile negroes are wise and good and delightful people merely because they belong to a victimized race being human they can make colossal blunders and sometimes do but with all due respect to the gentler standpatters who are neither wilfully unamerican nor brutally callous i think that on the basic issue they are tragically mistaken i cannot believe as they keep insisting that what negroes ought to prize above all and what all good negroes will prize is a tensionfree community marked by unbroken peacethe peace of swallowed pride and stoic submission i cannot agree that the negros only proper course is to remain unfailingly meek and patient indifferent to his own vital interests and content to leave the easing of his woes to time or education or the evolutionary process as a more or less sacred philosophy now widely frozen into public policy this popular viewhowever understandable in the light of historyis today appallingly expensive and wholly indefensible it is i am convinced the white souths most deadly illusion and perhaps the biggest of all the current obstacles to reasonable racial progress in the united states its basic flaw i think can be simply stated in asking for a brand of patience that for millions of people could mean only one thingrenouncing for life their right to firstclass citizenshipthis wellmeant plea flies squarely in the face of human nature it demands the impossible of educated selfrespecting negro americans no one doubts of course that among the nations eighteen million negroes are thousands who are now domesticated to serfdom what healthy selfesteem they once may have had is now drained away no matter how wretched their plight they now seem willing and probably are to settle for the promise of a new deal for their grandchildren but todays rebel negroes emphatically arent no longer bound by the old slave psychology and scorning to grovel or beg or wheedle they are out to claim their american birthright now where debate and conference are possible they gladly reason and confer where doors are shut they knock on them and if need be they bring suit to pry them open their goal avowedly is not special privilege but evenhanded justice the boon of freedom and dignity and opportunity bestowed not on the basis of color but strictly on merit we have no wish to be treated as favorites they say in effect but we do seek and expectto be treated as people offhand one might think the gentler standpatters would find this demand fairly reasonable they are people of awareness and feeling and many are charming polished and in many respects humane why then their stubborn aversion to granting these aroused aspiring negroes the same unlimited chance at the same good things of life that they want for themselves why this fierce defense of inequality that so plainly lays them open to the charge once made by benjamin kidd against englands  th century upper classes of being on the wrong side of the biggest moral and social issue of their time it would take at least a book written by top experts in the social sciences to cope with this question and not even that i daresay would wholly unravel the mystery one prime root of the trouble of course is that for most of these decent whites there has been little or no chanceregardless of the quality of their education in other respectsto get a proper education on the race question even where emancipated welltrained teachers and other leaders have stood ready to impart the truth their lips have usually been sealed by a severely repressive political and social climate in the vast majority of southern classrooms where white youngsters are supposedly prepared for life any honest discussion of the race problem is so firmly tabooed that all but the most independent and daring students become no better informed about it than about the chemistry and physics say of outer space  be that as it may the sober truth is that one of the gentler standpatters favorite arguments that within the framework of segregation the white south is doing for negroes now about all that any negroes have a right to expect has now been demolished by a body of facts so impressive that one flouts it only at the risk of writing himself down as illogical undemocratic and strangely if not willfully blind this is not to suggest that all white supremacy policies as framed and supported by the souths more enlightened citizens have been unrelievedly black plainly they havent in one field especially despite all the inequalities and favoritism that flow inevitably from segregation the old paternal system has brought new life and hope to thousands of negroes by opening before them partway at least the doors of learning for generations ever since the populist uprising of the s the souths more humane and perceptive whites have stood firmlyoften against bitter oppositionfor public education for both races nor should the good fruits of this policy be minimized or forgotten not only has illiteracy among the regions negroes dropped sharplyfrom around  per cent just after the civil war to less than  per cent nowbut growing ranks of negro youth have steadily pressed on beyond the bare three rs to high school  college and professional training in recent decades in particular this spreading hunger for knowledge intensified for many by the seminal liberating forces of two world wars has brought forth what now suddenly seems very strange fruit to many on the cosier side of the caste curtain this is a whole new selfconfident negro generation that not only knows not uncle tom but declines even to honor his memory but this it need hardly be said is just the rub today of rip van winkle the storybook fellow who dozed off before  and didnt wake up until long after yorktown a thoughtful teacher once remarked that his real tragedy was not that he slept for twenty years but that he slept through a revolution and this precisely has been the tragedy of too many of the souths most highminded and powerful whites this revolution that has so stirred and wakened the younger negroes being almost wholly a segregated revolution has left the more sheltered whites as a group dozing placidly in a corner now that the winds of change are rattling their windows many are slowly rousing and rubbing their eyes but their longconditioned feelings their legendtinted racial sentiments and their gaynineties concept of the negros rightful place and role in american society all these remain pretty much intact and one result is that the myth of the satisfied welltreated negro lingers unabashedly on amazingly alive and kicking even among whites who ought to know betterand often in the highest of circles consider for example a comment tossed off by the honorable ben fortson georgias secretary of state in a talk with a newsweek reporter flatly charging that in the north they dont give a damn about the negro mr fortson declared warmly that the negro gets a fairer shake in the south because white southerners take a personal interest in him here you have neatly poured and mixed one of the souths most potent tranquilizersa mellow draught of agedinthewood folklore that vast numbers of otherwise hardheaded southerners tend to swallow without question but a question embarrassing though it be cries out to be raised what white southerners take what kind of personal interest in what negroes bound by the old habit of lumping all negroes into one big faceless category most whites never put the question that way but that i submit is the only realistic way to pose it for the unblinkable fact is that while some white southerners do take a patronizing interest in some negroes the vast majority take only a jealous political interest in most negroes and normally the main purpose of that concern is to keep all negroes in their place no matter how wellequipped deserving and legallyentitled they happen to be to get out of it now and then to be sure even in these fretful embittered days below the potomac one still hears wellmeaning segregationists earnestly protesting that they love the negro by which is meantmore often than notthat they feel a warm glow of sentiment commonly a blend of gratitude dependence pity and maybe nostalgic respect for some mammyimage for those negroes nearest their families who accept or seem to accept their place yet the very earnestness of these whites and the tone in which they affirm this affection make it painfully clear that they have no real awareness of this social siberia to which their love would banish all negroes merely because they are negroes it is true enough that in those negroes who happen to be their servantstheir cooks maids chauffeurs janitors yard men or other close employeesmany of these betteroff highminded southern whites do take a genuine kindly and often deeply appreciated personal interest and this vintage grace of the age of noblesse obligeso often and so fondly depicted in romantic novels from swallow barn to gone with the windcannot firmly be wholly scorned without it the lot of countless southernborn negroes from frederick douglass and hariett tubman to leontyne price  and willie mayswould in some respects have been far more grievous but say all one may in its defense it was never more than a balm a palliative like an icepack on a fevered brow a mor  phine shot in the arm it has doubtless done much to soothe the slow burn of segregation it has done nothing to heal it and never will where this benign concern abides among southern whites today it is typically and generally an emotion more condescending than compassionate prompted less by fellow feeling than by a sense i of honor and with its outward expression confined mainly to an occasional tip or bonus a christ  mast basket special help in trouble or sickness and maybe a generous donation now and then to the servants church or lodge as for any open active concern for the negros deeper yearnings and aspirationshis simple human urge to be seen and valued as a person his wish for a decent home in a good neighborhood and his frequently flaming eagerness for something more than the scraps and leftovers and handmedowns of a white mans worldthis feeling is not merely rare it is commonly so taboo that whites who dare display it are often pilloried as niggerlovers dogooders communist sympathizers and traitors to their class thus to argue as many whites do that todays negroes ought to quit pushing and let the issue be settled by strictly quiet noncontroversial meansthis is not only to be naive it is to flout a fine old american tradition by demanding in effect that negroes be denied a timehonored weapon of social change that americans of most groups and parties have freely employed since the birth of our republic it seems a fairly safe bet certainly that few if any white southerners who make this plea or white northerners either would care to swallow their own prescription like their forebears from  on down they normally feel no call to forego in defense of their own vital interests any valid protest or pressure the situation may demand many would be horrified if anyone suggested they should if their childrens school say got outrageously shortchanged in some crucial allocation of funds they would hardly shrug and say oh well time will take care of things eventually more likely than not they would call on the offending board and start pressing for action now nor could anyone doubt their reaction if the board dared to urge them for the sake of peace and goodwill to calm down and leave the matter to the tender mercies of the evolutionary process as injured parents they might not get what they wanted then or later but they would not like to be called extremists for raising a howl and only a pollyanna could believe that in many such situations anyway their cause would stand a ghost of a chance if they failed to howl whats more to contend that todays antisegregation pressures are coming too soon and too fast is to overlook some hard realities about the way any social order normally moves and changes regardless of how insistently or firmly negroes now push it ought to be clear that no drastic upheaval in the souths racial patterns is coming overnight the cold fact is as countless reform movements in our history attest that it is only by longcontinued boldly dramatized discontent and by vast amounts of seemingly immoderate agitation that any constructive nonviolent change has been achieved even gradually in a social habit as deeprooted as americas intenselyvenerated custom of racial segregation most militant negroes certainly understand this clearly enough they are not blind to the lessons of history they arent out to start a bloody revolution and they know that even in the year  both the north and the south in more than a few spots may still be a long way from being remodeled to their hearts desire but if they havent yet fully learned it these fencedin rebels are learning fast that any successful reformer as one of our best historians put it must be a disturber of the peace who often  trespasses on forbidden ground and commits assault and battery on human complacency like lawmakers in a fiercely partisan congress these negroes know that they must usually ask for about twice what they hopefully expect in order to get a third or fourth or even less of what they want since politics even in far less controversial areas is always the art of the possible theyve found that civilrights politics is often the art of extracting from defiant and diehard opponents the mere crumbs of the possible and having been taught it by sad experience they know that winning a paper triumph in congress or the courts is often only the prelude to a long and agonizing struggle to make the law of the land the halfhearted practice of atlanta dallas and miami or even of pittsburgh st louis new york san francisco and chicago the odds being what they are so grueling and discouraging a battle to be sure may well sift out the usual handful of sunshine patriots and summer soldiers indeed it already has but to think that the great majority will be frightened off by threats intimidation or reprisals or to imagine that the whole crusade can somehow be stopped by governors piously preaching defiance and insurrection is about like believing that one can hold back the dawn by shaking his fist at the rising sun  to adamant southern standpatters gentle or otherwise who say in effect stop fighting our cherished way of life or you may lose your shirt in the process many a fearless negro now seems to be replying i may even lose my life but ive reached the point where i think id rather die that way than to go on as things are and be humiliated to death an englishman gandhi once said never respects you until you stand up to him then he begins to like you and many of todays aggressive negroes i suspect have concluded this is no less true of their present adversaries having as a race been taught to bow and scrape before the white man and having seen this posture bring little if any increase in the freedom and justice accorded them they have now chosen to stand up and assert themselves this may not to be sure make white americans like them any better but neither they seem to be saying could it make millions of whites respect or like them any less as human beings and fellowcitizens anyway and whether most americans turn out to be like gandhis englishman or not one thing these fighting negroes figure seems sure their present mood and stance can hardly fail to make the world at largeeast and west colored and noncoloredrespect and applaud them far more

rising £ despair of from the total disablement to a busy and productive life former basketball star junius kellogg has become a living legend of how the handicapped can ij play a dynamic role in industry and community affairs kellogg was just embarking on an outstanding professional basketball career with the harlem globetrotters when a tragic automobile accident ended his playing days in  the accident which occurred near pine bluff arkansas left him in a coma for ten days and when he came to all four limbs were paralyzed he could only move his head for weeks kellogg hovered between life and death at the veterans administration hospital in little rock and physicians believed that only his superb physical con dition attained while a star for the manhattan college basketball team during the early s and later with the globetrotters enabled him to withstand the shock of his extensive injuries because of irreparable damage to his spinal cord doctors told him he would never be able to move his limbs again but an intensive rehabilitation program was soon begun and a physical therapist helped him exercise every joint daily it was a slow and apparently futile procedure until one day he discovered he could move a thumb given this impetus kellogg intensified his efforts until only his legs remained immobilized about six months after the accident kellogg was moved to the kingsbridge veterans hospital only a few miles from the manhattan college campus in the bronx new york at kingsbridge kellogg met an outstanding business executive who channeled his tremendous drive to make a new start in life the businessman was john s woodbridge pan american world airways comptroller who knew what it meant to suffer a severe injury and have to struggle to regain a normal life he had been badly injured while fighting with the french blue devils in world war i and by strength of will helped himself back to health woodbridge grateful for his own recovery knew that once a man was down didnt mean he couldnt make a comeback and with that in view he became a pioneer in the relatively untried policy of hiring disabled persons he had only one criterionthe ability of a person to do a job there is a misguided belief that since there is physical failure there must also be a mental barrier on the part of the man to display his ability woodbridge explains not content with merely hiring the disabled woodbridge also organized a wheelchair basketball team to advertise the dexterity and skill of such men and thats where kellogg came into stay when woodbridge spotted a man with such ability as kellogg in kingsbridge hospital he immediately asked him if he would coach the pan am jets kellogg readily agreed and he has helped to establish the paraplegic team as an international symbol of hope for thousands of handicapped persons around the world kellogg coached the team during periodic leaves from kingsbridge while still undergoing therapy there it was also at kingsbridge that he met another person who would change his life this was a pretty young social worker whose soft words and understanding also helped him to regain his cheer and confidence her name was clementine and kellogg fell in love with her and then he got up the courage to ask her to marry him since i made up my mind to lead as normal a life as possible i wasnt afraid of marriage he says after all marriage is as much a part of life as anything about a year after he entered kingsbridge he and clementine were married they moved into a comfortable bronx apartment selected to enable kellogg to come and go with ease the next big step for him was to get a fulltime job and here his friend woodbridge helped him again one day mr woodbridge asked me when are you going to start working i told him id studied to be a physical education teacher in college and i wasnt prepared to do any other kind of work mr woodbridge arranged for me to take special courses that enabled me to go to work for pan americans accounting department ive been with pan am ever since kellogg suggests that learning to accept ones limitations is essential to gaining maximum potential out of life when youre confined to a wheelchair acceptance is the whole thing in a nutshell he continues youve got to train for a job you can do in a wheelchair obviously some jobs just cant be done by paraplegics but there are many jobs open in offices and professional fields and the situation is constantly improving the main thing is that first you must have the desire to train yourself and then you must qualify kellogg adds employers must also have the willingness to hire disabled persons some employers however go to the other extreme and only hire the handicapped i dont think this is very healthy its best for disabled persons to work in an integrated atmosphere and not in a closed shop where he only encounters other disabled persons since leaving the hospital kellogg has led a normal and active lifeso active that it would put many persons with good legs in rest homes but such activity only seems to give him increasing satisfaction and happiness in addition to his duties at pan americans administrative headquarters in long island city kellogg finds time to fill eight or ten speaking engagements every month there are also the practice and coaching sessions with the jets who play about eight games a month i get a chance to exercise a lot with the other fellows this way so its good for me too he says the jets participate in the international paralympics at london every year and they have captured five world championships in wheelchair athletics the players are versatile and not only participate in basketball but in swimming table tennis discus and hammer throwing also in  kellogg led the jets on a tour of brazil and the team played exhibitions before  persons winning the plaudits of the south american countrys president for their inspiring exam pie to the disabled everywhere pan american also has flown the team to berlin and israel to demonstrate the abilities of handicapped persons the airlines activities on behalf of the handicapped have brought it numerous awards including citations from the federation of the handicapped and the presidents committee on employment of the physically handicapped last year the paralyzed veterans of america selected pan american as employer of the year for its outstanding record of employment of paraplegics and other physically handicapped persons kelloggs strenuous efforts have helped the airline further its message throughout the world that almost anyone can lead a useful life if you just want to just to make sure he doesnt leave himself with any loafing time kellogg enrolled at new york law school last september and attends classes four nights a week he hopes to be admitted to the bar so that he can take on greater responsibilities at pan american the former hoop star rises at six every morning and rarely gets to bed before midnight i never think about all my activities he says otherwise i might get tired what helps me is that i never worry about what i cant do i find there are so many things i can do so i go out and do them i dont think ive had a bad day since ive been hurt sometimes when ive been a little depressed id look around and see so many people much worse off than myself and that includes people i see walking around and muttering to themselves a handicap can exist in the mind also and not only in the body other disabled persons have given me inspiration one fellow in the hospital never regained use of any part of his body and can only move his head yet he has become a very good artist while painting with a brush held in his mouth that takes a lot of courage and is wonderful to see kellogg travels anywhere people will listen to his message to help the thousands of handicapped who have not been able to resume normal lives under the aegis of the national paraplegic foundation kellogg lectures on paraplegia and helps the organization raise money for spinal cord research his example has enabled others to become leaders in the growing field of rehabilitation many of the jets leave the team to organize other groups so that even more paraplegics can participate kellogg and woodbridge have each made giant contributions in resurrecting human lives guided by a simple philosophy give this man the chance the opportunity of employment not stopping with superficial utterances of commiseration but translating belief in his ability into action and we have benefitted not only the man and our country but most of all ourselves 
the negro medici

h e reign of lorenzo t £ the magnificent  t  in florence  italy connotes the highest expression of art in all its ramifications florence became the treasure house of the loveliest objects in the world long before columbus discovered the new world lorenzo succeeded his father in  and for nine years ruled jointly with his younger brother giuliano this brother who was assassinated in  left an illegitimate son guilio  and this guilio became pope of the roman catholic church in  as clement vii however in plain american there was a nigger in the woodpile for long before clement vii was considered for high honors and princely attainmentlong before the smoke slowly poured forth from the chimney of the consistorial chambers of the vatican in rome announcing his successful election to the papacyguilio as a youth had fallen desperately in love with an african venus whom some claimed was a slave others a trusted servant in the ducal household this woman anna bore a child alessandro to the future pope then to save her good name and that of guilio she was quickly married off to the duke of urbino who reigned in the city that gave birth to raphael all the authorities acknowledge these facts his mother was a mulatto slave and he had dark skin thick lips and the curly hair of a negro there is no doubt of this though none cared at the time to contradict the popes assertion that he was the son of lorenzo duke of urbino and as such he has generally been mentioned in history historians contending themselves with saying he was reputed to be so but was more probably clements own son again he is described as alessandro whose wooly hair and negrolike appearance had already caused him to be called the moor yet another has said his mother was a woman of color a tartar slave girl who passed for a wife of a courier trollope the american historian of the florentine commonwealth after looking at alessandros picture discovers naturally that he was of low type but in this judgment he does not agree with the great emperor charles king of spain and emperor of the holy roman empire charles while staying at the medici palace with alessandro relates how pleasant it was to meet the popes relative there must be secreted or pigeonholed somewhere interesting facts concerning this favorite boy before he was taken within the sacred cloisters of the vatican alessandro annas boy was a shrewd lad and was naturally disliked and feared by his ambitious relatives but he became the inseparable companion of pope clement vii when the wheel of life registered his thirteenth birthday alessandro blossomed out with undisputed rights to the distinguished line of the medici succession the fine italian hand of the pope unseen but clearly in evidence was behind his godson and ippolito cardinal and illegitimate grandson of lorenzo had no earthly chance to win the ducal throne on a political chessboard directed by the popes master mind his eminent guardian bestowed great honors and princely gifts on alessandro in  he made him joint ruler of florence with his cousin ippolito and under the guardianship of cardinal passerini but the city was in turmoil and expelled its rulers thereupon pope clement made peace and alliance with the emperor charles v and the emperor captured florence in  then the emperor graciously assisted the pope in carrying out his wishes to promote the welfare of his son an agreement was signed at bologna  and alessandro became first hereditary duke of florence charles v renowned in the military and political horizon of the old world and associated with the wealth and possessions of the new world was power personified and of his children both his daughter margaret of parma  like her celebrated halfbrother don juan of austria who crushed the turkish fleet at the battle of  lepanto were illegitimate the silent and beautiful monument of alessandro first duke of florence parian marble in the escorial monastery pantheon of the spanish kings describes don juan to the casual visitor as filius naturalis likewise was the daughter margaret who at the age of fifteen was betrothed to alessandro the mulatto medici the barcelona treaty of the marriage provides that alessandro the natural son of clement vii should marry margaret thus dropping all affected doubts on the subject of alessandros parentage the royal nuptials took place  at san lorenzo with all the pomp which a ruling emperor of germany king of spain and naples etc could command for his daughter as a bride the pope clement vii head of the catholic church all powerful and mighty most feared in those days of temporal powers ruler over great dominions gave to his natural son generous gifts befitting his station both parents were entirely satisfied and lavished enough money on the event to ransom a kings crown but the throne which alessandro gained was not easy to hold the nobles were incensed at their loss of power to a hereditary monarch confirmed by imperial patent and royal alliance there was no question of color or race but a bitter fight for lost privileges conspiracy was rife centering about cardinal ippolito who was poisoned perhaps by order of alessandro the character of alessandro has been disputed he was true medici patron of art and ruler of men he surrounded himself with distinguished and able councillors vellori guiciardini and valori but he was also a medici in his pleasures and excesses and he was surrounded by medici like his cousin lorenzino who betrayed him and murdered him in his sleep with the help of a hired desperado on january   the night outside showed the silvery stars twinkling as the clock ticked away the minutes indoors low and high ecclesiastics gathered hurriedly attendants were there to place the lifeless body of the duke of florence in the tomb of the duke urbino silently with low words they offered prayers for the repose of a soul ushered into eternity the marble slab was gently replaced and every indication of forcing the tomb cleared away the assassins made their escape and for a time consternation reigned supreme in florence cosimo i alessandros cousin and successor caused the traitors house to be destroyed making the place a street for the masses to tread on the wretched regicide four centuries later in fair and lovely florence in the palaces of the medici you may have strolled through the galleries of unsurpassed sculpture artistic objects of infinite beauty and wondered how all these priceless articles could be gathered in this city long before columbus discovered america here where michelangelo exercised his manysided genius where titians canvases resplendent in their charming and beautiful colors view each other with soulful eyeshere in the uffizi gallery is one picture that brings you back to look at it again you will have noticed among the bronzinos remarkable paintings one labelled alessandro   look at it again carefully and you will be drawn closer by the fact it is unlike those other white men and rosecolored fair women scattered in those magnificent halls among tombs of their ducal heads do not for a moment think that it is the picture of a menial an efficient porter or a pleasant waiter make no such mistake it is the picture of the mulatto duke i think if this had happened in north america the picture would have been removed long ago and by some plausible excuse relegated to the cellar or entirely discarded but the florentines lived up to the judgment of history the truth cannot be always concealed from the eyes of the world so here is the unvarnished story of the picture a young man of negro descent was married to the daughter of the emperor of germany king of spain and king of naples and he the first duke of florence during days of shadow and adversity florence would seek with devoutness and piety the black virgin of the impruneta to be carried through the streets as an intercessional to help bring back peace and prosperity to the people they had no prejudice against a black face for their patron saint was the color of the first duke of florence alexander dumas pere negro digest july  distinguished in french letters and selfacknowledged of negro descent foremost historical novelist of his day if not of all days has left us this apt word let the medici rest in peace in their tombs of marble and porphyry for they have done more for the glory of the world than any king prince or emperor  
the first negro
by leo militelio
ntil recently little was y known about bishop i ii j r james augustine healv the first cath  s  olic negro bishop of the united states when the fact was rediscovered by historians foley albert s sj bishop healy beloved outcaste farrow straus and young  bishop healy once again became a prominent figure in the history of the catholic church in america perhaps the interest taken in the bishops life was at first due to the impact this would have upon the problem of segregation in the united states with the study of his life though it does not take long to realize that there is more to james augustine healy than the mere fact that he was colored his whole life is permeated with a deep love for god and his fellowmen regardless of whether these men were black or white irish or french catholic or protestant he was a father to his flock his childrens bishop james augustine healy was born in macon georgia on april   his father michael was a catholic irish immigrant his mother mary eliza a slave woman michael always treated his wife as an equal and he loved her very much their marriage proved to be a very successful one for god blessed this union with ten children god was very pleased with the healys because three of the healy boys became priests and two of the girls entered the religious life the healy family lived quietly on their georgia plantation the boys were trained and educated at home at first but michael was soon made to realize that should he die his whole family would be considered slaves by the state of georgia imprisoned and sold one day some of michaels neighbors were taking advantage of his hospitality one of them began to make sly and subtle remarks about his wife eliza the pretty wench who kept house for him when one fellow went so far as to remark that michael had a mighty nice bunch of slave boys who would bring a good price on the slave market michael could take no more jumping up he turned toward his house and yelled mary eliza turn loose the dogs his neighbors instantly disappeared never to return it was this incident that made michael decide to take his boys away from such narrowminded men michael then enrolled james in a quaker school in new york this was the only private school that would admit the boy with the telltale marks of his ancestry it was not long before his brothers hugh and patrick joined him there the boys were not too happy at this school for they suffered much from this friendly brotherhood group james was a very sensitive boy he was deeply hurt by the sly whispers and dirty epithets scribbled on the walls about him and his brothers which he resented more he could not say the meanness of his playmates or the patronizing attitude of his abolitionist schoolmasters exiled from the plantation james found himself an outcast back in georgia the healy plantation continued to prosper michael took part in the social life of the county but only in a business and governmental capacity he knew that mary eliza would never be accepted by the puritanical and narrowminded georgians there was not a catholic church in macon when michael settled there and the phariseesism of his neighbors kept him from partaking in their religious worship michael detested these men who raised a brood of yard children and then sold them into slavery demanding a higher price for them because they were mulattoes about the year  while michael was returning from a visit to his boys he met bishop fitzpatrick of boston michael told the kind bishop of the plight of his boys and the bishop induced him to send them to the newly established holy cross college in worcester massachusetts michael was very much impressed by the reception the jesuit fathers gave his boys here it was that the healy boys became catholics it was not long before james reached the top of his class scholastically with his brother hugh running a close second after graduation from holy cross college james decided to go on to the priesthood after confiding all his difficulties and worries to his spiritual father dad fenwick james left for the sulpician seminary in montreal james wrote back to dad fenwick i am just about in the same reputation here as i was at worcester that is a laughing godforgetting rascal good enough when he behaves himself a great lover of theology especially dogma and the classics in june of  james received tonsure and four minor orders in  his brother sherwood entered the seminary in montreal in this same year james received his subdeaconate and then crossed the ocean to continue his studies in the famous sulpician seminary in paris finally on june   the memorable day arrived and james was ordained a priest of god by archbishop sibour in the cathedral of notre dame in paris bishop fitzpatrick welcomed james into the diocese of boston it was at this time that james wrote to dad fenwick the mercy of god has placed a poor outcast on a throne of glory that ill becomes him if i could have been as safe elsewhere as here i should have desired never to show my face in boston james had good reason to fear boston anticatholic feeling ran high there james first appointment was as assistant at the guardian angel home a home for all wayward boys father james and his boys soon became close friends but father james did not limit his work to the orphans he daily visited the wharf tenements here in the irish ghettos he administered to the cholera typhoid and tuberculosis victims such misery was very common among these outcast people it was especially for his work among these people and the love he showed them that he later won the title of best loved priest in the diocese of boston during the year  boston became once again the center of the bitter struggle against the catholic church the nativists took over bishop fitzpatrick found himself forced to engage in public political battle if the church were to survive there to help him he appointed father james as his secretary father james threw himself wholeheartedly into this new job which was at the same time a promotion for him the cathedral parishioners were soon spellbound by his preaching which was simple but strong together with the bishop he tramped and went about the slums of boston visiting the sick comforting the sorrowful and afflicted and caring for the many orphans both men were heroic in their work among the immigrants during the cholera epidemic from bishop fitzpatrick james learned how to deal with the noncatholics of boston and new england he saw how they admired bishop fitzpatrick because he was not afraid to make himself heard because he was deeply patriotic and because he constantly invoked the principles of the american constitution when the civil war broke out in  father james and bishop fitzpatrick found their fellow priest the rector of the cathedral father hilary tucker a staunch southerner father hilary argued at table with the bishop and father james when father hilary began thundering his views from the cathedral pulpit bishop fitzpatrick removed him from the position of rector and installed father james in his place that father james untiringly fulfilled his added duties as pastor of souls had to be admitted even by his strongest rival father hilary father hilary who remained at the cathedral continually criticized his opponent but was finally won over to father james by his patient charity and friendly attitude despite all the bitter criticisms in  when bishop fitzpatrick died father james was appointed to succeed the newly elected bishop john williams as the pastor of the biggest parish in boston st james for the next nine years he devoted himself to this flock and became known as the beloved pastor of st james the story is told of how father james saved his parish during the great boston fire of november   just three blocks from his church the flames whipped up and down taking everything in their path firemen were powerless and water was scarce it looked as if the whole south side of the city would be destroyed as the people of his parish frantically began packing their possessions in an attempt to save what little they could father james came out of church prayer book in hand he walked to the corner of summer and lincoln there he stood guard opening his prayer book he began to pray aloud as the flames drew near father james companions left him and soon he stood all alone suddenly as he prayed the wind changed and the fire began to head for the wharf sixtyfive acres of the city were destroyed and  buildings were burned but father james parish was untouched by the holocaust when in the year  two of bostons neighboring dioceses became vacant rumors went wild that they would probably be filled by the healy brothers father james brother father sherwood also working in the diocese as secretary to bishop williams was picked by some as the next bishop from boston others favored father james because he was much older when news came from rome in february of  that james augustine healy was elected by pope pius ix as the second bishop of portland maine the friends of father james were jubilant when bishopelect healy alighted from his coach in his new diocese he was deeply worried as to whether his flock would accept him would any of the clergy resign would the teaching sisters accept a negro bishop these were a few of the many questions that flashed through his mind that morning immediately after his consecration bishop healy began his first visitation of his diocese it was a real missionary journey by train stagecoach buggy boat and on foot the bishop traveled though he was never strong wrote cardinal oconnell he traveled continually over the length and breadth of his vast diocese and as he spoke english elegantly and french very correctly his sermons in both languages of rather high order were listened to by all his congregations with the greatest interest and edification by the time his first summer was over bishop healy had traveled some  miles he administered the sacrament of confirmation to about  children and had preached more than a hundred sermons it took courage for the new bishop to mount the pulpit in north whitefields church of st denis where he had been publicly denounced by the pastor because of his indelicate blood the incident that brought about this public denunciation is a very interesting one when bishop healy was still a priest of the diocese in boston he often went to maine for his vacations on one such trip he gathered a number of children together to teach them their catechism because the neighboring priest of st denis church who was in charge of the children neglected them when the priest heard about this he was furious father james begged pardon of the pastor and asked him not to make a public denunciation but to no avail when father james became bishop of maine the embarrassed priest resigned his post bishop healy refused to accept the resignation it wasnt long before bishop healy became known as the childrens bishop they ran to him and walked with him one could often see him walking up and down the sidewalk with three or four children each holding one of his fingers during the winter when there was snow bishop healy would take his beloved children for sleigh rides bishop healy regularly took his turn in the pastoral duties of the cathedral parish he would often say mass in the mission churches attached to the cathedral he even helped out in the small wooden chapel of st aloysius for the convenience of the extremely poor who did not have enough money to buy sunday clothes and who were reluctant to attend mass at the cathedral the bishop loved the poor he often rode through town on his horse with saddle bags full of groceries he would stop at the back doors knock and greet a tired housewife he knew all of the poor by name and he always had a greeting for each of them he often paid their overdue taxes and doctor bills and this he did personally for this afternoon relaxation bishop healy would drop in to visit the sick of the parish old mrs murphy told how the bishop upon hearing that her son was sick with pneumonia threw his cloak over his cassock and hiked through the snow and slush in order to visit the sick lad for his daily work bishop healy heard confessions both while at home and on visitation of his diocese a young girl told how she entered the confessional and halfway through her confession she realized it was the bishop she was confessing to she could not go on the bishop in his kind manner tried to help her i cant tell you the rest of my sins she cried in distress the bishop reminded her that nothing revealed in the confessional could ever be spoken of later but replied the girl its something i said against the bishop well now my child what did you say against the bishop ii said the bishop was as black as the devil the girl blurted out oh my child said the bishop dont say the bishop is as black as the devil you can say hes as black as coal or as black as the ace of spades but dont say hes as black as the devil such forgiving charity could not help but endear him to his flock a young boy related how one afternoon he added to his hurried confession    and i called the bishop a nigger the bishop drew aside the curtain and said to the wideeyed boy well son is there anything wrong with being a nigger take a good look at your bishop is there anything wrong with being a nigger the boy gulped and answered oh no bishop it has been just over half a century since bishop healy died on august   he had suffered much physically from poor health that is why he could understand so well the sufferings of the epidemicstricken immigrants he suffered mentally from the sly and sharp remarks of the narrowminded bigots and this is why he could sympathize with those suffering from similar trials bishop healy was ever faithful to his great mission of sympathy with those who suffer without distinction of race creed or color so that although the world may forget his color it will never forget his charity 
the meaning of apartheid
by dr horace mann bond
o be understood we must always remember that the word apartheid is joined to that of baaskap  white supremacy it is a theory that is used to justify the complete domination of  per cent of the population of a country by a minority of  per cent this is the naked and unashamed policy of the national government in every nation the national policy finds in the educational system its ultimate instrument for perpetuating as well as perfecting the national aspiration in south africa this national will is reflected in numerous enactments covering every phase of life the legislation governing education is as elsewhere the ultimate embodiment of policy for today and for generations yet to comeindeed one nationalist leader has projected the  state of things envisioned as enduring for two thousand years the basic educational legislation governing the fate and destiny of the vast majority of south africas population is the bantu education act of  under this act complete control by the state is made the prerequisite of state assistance to education ordinarily no one could take exception to such a provision it is the diabolical expression of the minority but dominant will to enforce both apartheid and baaskap that adds an utterly sinister quality to the provision other provisions of the act placed its administration under the department of native affairs rather than under the department of education a step that emphasizes the fact that the intent was the perfection of apartheid rather than educational the aim of education was that of    developing the individual as a member of society so that he can take his rightful place within the society to which he belongs and where is the rightful place of the african in south african society it is that of a subhuman tender of an inhuman machine given just enough educationrather training to permit him to tend the machine it is that of an agricultural serf tied to the every demand of his white baas it is as a member of an impoverished tribal society condemned to semistarvation in a bantustan where he remains as a convenient reservoir of black labor but let me introduce here the eloquent testimony of chief albert luthuli nobel laureate on the bantu education act bantu education came into effect in  it is a specialized type of education designed exclusively by europeans exclusively for africans it is not as were former educational systems in south africa designed simply by adults for children it is not to be judged on the details of its syllabuses though what i know of these is shoddy enough it can be understood only in the light of the declared intentions of its begetters in the context of other legislation enforcing the masterservant relationship and by its effects    the principle of school boards is excellent in practice in the present situation it is harmfuland the african communities are never freely represented on them    the effect of providing one teacher for a minimum of sixtyfive children is to reduce efficiency    the effect in a fastdeveloping society with a growing population of limiting to v million pounds per year the government money contribution to african education for all time is to bleed the poorest section of the community dry and to insure progressive stunting of african education for lack of funds the effect of forcing african parents to choose between school feeding and school building is to impoverish us poorer still under the new system state provision of books has disappeared too and that makes us poorer still even though the government now pays the teachersa mercy denied to us by the smuts government    the effect of double sessions taught by the same teachers is to overburden them to the point of exhaustion while the effect of twentyminute lessons is to waste much time of what there is the effect of using only the many vernaculars as media of instruction is to cut children off deliberately and violently from access to outside influences and ideasand the heritage of much of the civilized world this of course brings us to the heart of the matter african children have previously had some small access to the commonwealth of learning they have reached out many of them after its riches and many of our african doctors and lawyers and teachers have proved themselves able to absorb not only learning but western culture in less than two thousand years in south africa this has set up tensions and evoked the threat of encroachment upon the white standard of living and allwhite rule so the door has to be slammed shut hard in the faces of the young generation and a system devised which will recondition us to accept perpetual inferiority and perpetual isolation from western learning and culture to isolate us and to convince us of our permanent inferiority these two motives lie behind much legislation and from the act of union until now and the bantu education act is a major means to this end whatever may be said in favour of certain altered details of bantu education and i do not deny that here and there is to be found a minor improvement or two the overall effect of this system is not educational at all but political it is a tool in the hands of the white master for the more effective reduction and control of the black servant i have quoted chief lithuli at length both because his simple eloquence describes this utterly inhumaneeven monstrouseducational procedure better than i could but also because this great man himself illustrates the paramount importance for a world seeking peace and freedom of keeping open the free flow of culture from the past to the present and so to the future it is also interesting to note that chief luthuli and other leaders in the struggle for freedom in south africa are closely related and indeed frequently indebted to a pipeline that led from the ancient past to the lonely outpost of freedom this man now occupies and americans of african descent fortuitously or in the grand mechanics of human destiny proved foremost as carriers of the flame note here that i am not talking about christian principles nor even of what is sometimes called western civilization chief luthuli himself deprecates the idea when he says the christian faith sprang from asia minor and to this day it speaks with a semitic voice western civilization is only partly western it embraces the contribution of many lands and many races it is an inheritance something received to be handed on not a white preserve  what chief luthuli is speaking  ibid p  of is that idea of concern for the individual and for his worth that flowed out of ancient china and india and out of the mesopotamian valleys on the wings of hammurabis stylus and out of the arabian deserts and the egyptian and greek temples and from the upper reaches of the nile where peasants and scribes and princes were black he is speaking of the very crux of the human matter of the old old notions that were preserved through the ages by moorish caliphs entertaining indiscriminately in their palaces men of learning who were arab and jew african and european and whose genius helped revive a somnolent europe and set in motion that renaissance of learning from which the contemporary culture we call western was manufactured

herron hill 
by a b andover
years ago when y t ii a v we moved to herron  i j hill we thought we u were settled for a lifetime in a pleasant neighborhood in central pittsburgh we can drive either to the golden triangle business district or to the oakland civic center in five minutes although ours is a nondescript endhouse in a fourunit row we like it our backyard is small but in march the cardinals tune up and later in the spring we see wrens goldfinches and of course robins an occasional hummingbird drinks from our butterfly bushes and a mantis prayed through one summer on our blue morning glory in good fruitbearing years our neighbor gives us treeripened peaches and he would share his cherries too but the birds strip these before he can gather them fortunately the birds bypass the apples so we have deepdish cobblers and sauce from august until frost we feed the squirrels and rabbits that wander by from the wild hillsides i do the best i can to ignore the garter snakes on sweltering july nights we particularly enjoy our backyard because it is equipped with one very comfortable hammock for my hus band a relaxing beach chair for me and a dependable breeze our backyard measures only twentybyfifty feet and is completely surrounded by adjoining houses but it affords almost the privacy of a country estate a dense vine of hops covering our fence provides a barrier to stray animals or curious passersby now all of this is changing our little eden has been invaded by vermin brought to our street on herron hill by careless neighbors who moved here after being pushed out of the lower hill district now rats chew through the large mounds of refuse from the overflowing garbage cans in our block roaches infest my kitchen bedbugs and mice stage blitzkrieg sorp ties up and down our row on hot days when the windows are open the stench is terrible the rats were the first sign that the neighborhood was changing these appeared promptly when a new family moved into the house back of us after unloading their furniture they immediately patched together a chicken coop from some odds and ends of scrap lumber and wire the materials were donated by an adjoining newcomer who had just as promptly installed a junk business in his backyard several families complained to the city health department about the junk and the chickens which violate our health and sanitation ordinances by the time the city checked the complaint the rats had moved in to stay our rats could be seen day and night crossing our backyard on their way from their comfortable nests in the junk pile to the chicken yard for their necessary nourishment after repeated warnings of legal action by the city the chickens made a slow exit onebyone into the family pot i presume the junk yard is still with us the last time i discussed this nuisance with the city complaint center i gathered that the complaint officer on the other end of the telephone didnt care much what happens on herron hill he seemed concerned as long as he thought our block was somewhere in the allwhite schenley farms section of the hill when he suddenly realized that we are located in the negro herron hill side his tone changed as he cut short my complaint with an abrupt ok ill be out in the years which have passed the junk pile has continued and the rats are snugly multiplying in their comfortable quarters ive been assured that nothing short of a cataclysm will remove these pests once theyve established a good beachhead in a natural habitat such as our adjoining junk yard occasionally we have a short respite from the roaches that infest our house after we put on an allout drive with the modern deadly chemicals developed for jungle warfare during world war ii what worked so successfully in the south pacific gives only temporary relief in our row house on herron hill our hardy pests dont drop dead they retreat for a brief rest in their combat headquarters in the third house in our row the family in this house consists of three adults three children a dog and a paralyzed pet henall crowded into four rooms the fifth room is rented to an elderly invalid who has a prolific cat no wonder the roaches retreat to these quarters to restore their strength for the next attack on us from this same house were also constantly threatened with bedbugs and mice but these are easiest to control fortunately im alerted when theyre on the march my friend maggie not so fortunate lives in the second unit between me and the third family and naturally shes attacked first i am procrastinating about moving out of this row because i once enjoyed it so much but when maggie leaves as  shes threatening to do my days here will be numbered its easy to blame our new neighbors for the bad conditions we now live with but i cant forget that they are really victims not culprits they are the victims of pittsburghs poor planning for its urban redevelopment because lowcost housing is unavailable for negro families compelled to move by the demolition of the lower hill district they were forced to purchase property which they cant afford they are meeting their mortgage payments by subletting a room which they need so badly for their own family im annoyed because their crowded unsanitary living affects my household but they are the ones who face the more serious problem meeting the payments on a  mortgage for a house which sold for  ten years ago im more annoyed that pittsburghs touted urban redevelopment plan demolishes the slums in the lower hill only to transplant the blight to our block in herron hill the family in the fourth unit of our row for instance meets the payments on their mortgage with the income from a weekend barbecue their barbecue is the most tantalizing however illicit small business in our block from friday through sunday we are besieged with the delectable odor of pork basted frequently with an authentic hot sauce roasting on an honesttogoodness pit over slowly burning coals i can resist the temptation to patronize my neighbors commissary because i know the succulent ribs are only a promotional comeon the profitable sales item here is not food but the drinks in a package deal for one dollar customers are served two ribs on one slice of bread a dab of cole slaw and one shot of cheap blended whiskey or gin cut of course the profit must be terrific can you stop after eating only two ribs of real southern barbecued pork i probably would succumb to the enticing ribs if i didnt have the confirmed bourbon drinkers dislike for blended whiskies anyhow so far i have resisted the barbecue and all of the other rent parties or socials which are now so common in our section of herron hill saturday naturally is the favorite day for these socials because they can continue until dawn or even throughout the sabbath if the games are hot gambling is an accepted part of the entertainment and with the excellent food customers can enjoy poker pinochle whist black jack crap or bingo but never bridge bridge is too slow for a fast house cut the quiet of the early sunday morning hours on herron hill suddenly ends when the guests emerge from these festivities after an evening of sport they are in a mood to express all of the emotions known to man some are jubilant others arc depressed by the surfeit of pleasure but all are raucous i have yet to hear their noisy leavetaking interrupted by the soothing sound of police cars arriving to halt the proceedings by a long overdue raid some socials are very quiet guests are carefully screened and personally invited by the hosts to these select affairs held in comfortable or even sumptuous recreation rooms here suave croupiers smoothly remove those who become objectionably loud the owners devious weekend activities which supplement their regular incomes must not taint their reputations as respectable residents of herron hill another small business also operates quietly and efficiently in our block pretty call girls can be seen speeding away in taxicabs after completing their work in the fancy afterhours spot across the street from us the numbers baron who lives next door to this spot is particularly disturbed his young son has asked dad several awkward questions about the girls our baron is scurrying around to find a house in a more conventional neighborhood so that his son can spend his formative years in the proper environment you may marvel at a racketeers strong feelings about a vice which should not disturb him of all people but numbers now is a respectable business in our block welldressed collectors make their daily pickup around noon crisscrossing our street missing few houses they enjoy about the same status as sam the fruit and vegetable huckster who has served two generations of herron hill customers something else also seems to be going on in our neighborhood now without knowing it i probably associate with dope addicts but recently i encountered one whom a policeman with only a cursory glance labelled hophead a stranger to me she rushed into my house through the back door screaming theyre after me she collapsed on my kitchen floor i locked the door called the police then rapped sharply on the dining room wall in an sos for maggie next door maggie rushed over we thought the girl on my floor had really fainted after escaping her pursuers we were positive that the policeman was wrong when they hustled her out to the patrol car after assuring us that she was only hoppedup later in the evening when my husband came home before maggie and i could finish our exciting story he commenced laughing at us for not recognizing a hophead immediately we still werent convinced but on the following dayr a police investigator called confirmed the dope charge and asked for details about the incident shortly afterwards we read that a dope squad had raided in our block and found a considerable cache on one of our unassuminglooking new neighbors as i think of the changes which have taken place on herron hill since pittsburghs redevelopment started i wonder if somehow we didnt get the cart before the horse lowcost private housing for all of the families to be displaced rated « the top spot in our plans something happened to those plans and the funds arrived too late to construct the houses nevertheless the demolition of the lower hill district proceeded as scheduled and the evacuated families crowd  ed into other areas where housing shortages have existed for a long time for negro residents true city hall as its part in the redevelopment passed new housing ordinances to eliminate tene  ments forever and to improve health and sanitation but the rats in my backyard point to ineffectual administration of the statutes also the barbecue and after hour spots raise some doubts about the police vigilance in our neighborhood frederick gutheim  who evaluated pittsburghs redevelopment for the architectural forum observed the time has come when projects are probably not enough when indeed the problems they are creating are becoming nearly as important as the problems which existed before and which they have claimed to eradicate clearing the slums in the lower hill cost pittsburgh   wonder how much it will cost us  someday to clear the slums of herron hill i know its going to cost me a lot to move away 
the democrat
by richard a kalish
he japs are nice peoq
 r  pie and all but i just
  dont think they under
d stand american ways gjr
j j met n
yokohama for an example
but first i figure i better tell you
some things about the japs that
maybe you dont know first off
dont ever talk about them as
japs its okay between us because
you know i dont mean no
disrespect but its insulting when
you do it right to their faces like
this nisei captain i had he was
a jap but he was born and raised
in los angeles and he was just like
he was an american he said to
never use the word jap because
it was insulting but to always use
japanese
and i wouldnt want to show
no disrespect for them because the
truth is that i respect them people
except that they should learn more
about democracy the japs are
a honest people and very kind to
children and very polite except on
trains when they are real bastards
even the women
now about this jap girl i was
talking about i really liked her
 she was nice enough to marry although i dont go along with this marrying other kinds of people and having strangelooking kids but the important thing is she was nice enough to marry even if i never wouldnt do it there are lots of cheap women in japan but there are cheap women in san diego and chicago so that dont mean nothing but this girl she was nice i met her when we were sitting at the same table at a little joint for lunch and i couldnt get the waitress to bring me no napkin and she explained to me that i should use that towel they bring you like a napkin stupid of me huh not to figure that out myself and we got to talking and i learned she worked in a department store the takaysomethingorother and i told her how i was in the navy for ten years and had never been married and such and she told me how she liked to talk with americans and learn about america and democracy and hollywood and like that now i seen my chance to do something for democracy no bull i know it sounds like bull but it aint you probably figure i was looking for a quick lay but i can tell you that i can get one of those without hardly trying but a nice girl is different i figured if i could help her learn more about democracy and she could tell her friends and they could tell their friends you know that kind of thing can do international relations a lot  more good than speechmaking and stuff so i made a date to meet her for an afternoon movie the next day on account of her father wouldnt let her go out at night and maybe wouldnt let her go out with no american sailor only i never knew for sure i figured we could have something to drink or maybe a sandwich and a coke after the movie and i could talk to her about democrary and chalk up a couple of marks for uncle sam of course at the time i didnt realize how a person can think they like democracy and not understand it like americans do the movie was real good we went to one of those samery things and she explained to me what was happening only it was so simple it didnt take no explaining about some big shot with the front part of his hair shaved oif who gets himself killed and a bunch of guys that work for him swear theyll get even for him and they take years but they kill the guy that killed the first guy and then they give themselves up because they committed a crime and finally they all kill themselves but in an honorable way its like the japs you know to worry about honorable dying and other kinds of dying and the difference is very important after the movie we went out for coffee only it was so strong i couldnt drink it until i put some water in because she really goes for coffee i guess the japs have been drinking tea so long they really dig coffee when they can get it then she asked me about america and i really told her just like i was a damned histcry teacher i told her about the war we fought against england to be free and the war we fought against the south so that the niggers wouldnt be slaves no more and about how california and texas got settled and the pioneers and all this girl she ate it up so we made a date for another movie the next saturday the next time we seen john wayne in that thing about the alamo because i thought it would help her understand american history how the americans fought the greasers and how all the heroes died in the alamo but how america finally won the war and captured texas and afterwards i explained more to her about democracy the way she listened and smiled and shook her head up and down i was positive she understood me shows how wrong a guy can be this time i explained how everyone is equal and everyone can vote if he keeps out of jail i told her every man is as good as every other man like we got jewgovernors and a chinaman in the senate and i think we got a jap in the senate too and thats the next thing to being president i told her about how the navy got jews and italians as officers and that even an american like me has to salute these guys and say sir to them and thats real democracy and i talked about how the old navy used to keep niggers for just certain kinds of job but not the new navy nosir i must of talked nearly two hours and she kept asking questions and her eyes would open big like when i talked about the jap fellow in the senate and i could see she thought a lot better about the us but you know there are little things that you can understand only when you live in a place awhile and no matter how much you explain something a person who never lived there will never understand it well the thing that happened to me with this girl is a real good example of what i mean like im not criticizing her because she didnt know better but it shows what the lieutenant means when he says there are cultural differences between americans and japanese the third time i show up to meet her i can see shes talking to some navy guy i dont get jealous because were just friends and if some guy wants to date her more serious than me why i think he should when i come up to her she introduces me to this guy and goddamned if he isnt a nigger well i smile and shake hands with him like he was anyone else ive buddied with some swell niggers around the base and i dont have that kind of prejudices but when her and i get to the coffee place later i try to explain how nice girls dont get too mixed up with niggers like she should talk with them and be friendly and all because thats democracy but she shouldnt be too friendly or theyll ask her for a date and then she has to say no and everybody gets embarrassed then she tells me the guy already asked her for a date and she said all right and she hoped i wouldnt be mad because i told her i had a girl friend in san diego i told her that so as she wouldnt fall in love with me so i tried to explain to her that dating a nigger just isnt done so she asked me some dumb questions and they were so dumb i couldnt answer them you know the kind i mean she asked if everyone is equal why shouldnt everyone be equal to date and she asked if i was so proud of freeing the coloreds from being slaves why wasnt i proud of being in the navy with them and if niggers were ensigns and petty officers why shouldnt she date one because maybe some day hed be a ensign or a petty officer i guess she asked a lotta other questions but i dont remember because like i said they were the kind of questions you would expect from a foreigner who was just learning about democracy i shipped out after that and i never saw her again but i did get one letter from her she said she wasnt dating the colored sailor no more but he introduced her to another colored guy who was a captain in the air force and she thanked me for teaching her so much about democracy and said she understood the problems of democracy better from me than from all the books she ever read like i say the japs are a very nice people and i got lots of respect for them but there are some things about democracy the little differences that are really big differences that they just dont understand  
maestro dean dixon
by walter monfried
he cannot find a steady job in his native land dean dixon the american conductor has been traveling around the world in the last  years and winning its acclaim the audiences and critics of most european nations and of israel and australia have been unanimous in their praises of the likable undemonstrative maestro from harlem in recent years he has made nis headquarters in frankfort on the main an ancient cultural and commercial centerthe home of goethe the poet schopenhauer the philosopher and the bankers rothschild there he spends four months a year in the other eight months he speeds by plane or his own little car to the major orchestras of many capitals recently he was appointed permanent leader of the symphony orchestra of sydney australia a metropolis of   because of his numerous commitments he will conduct only for short periods in sydney until march  when he will begin his first full term the australian newspapers report that the music public there is pleased by the appointment says the sydney morning herald concertgoers became aware at dixons first concerts here last november that he was a conductor worth waiting for unobtrusively commanding on the concert platform with a beat and gestures that were free from unnecessary emphasis he at once established a quiet unforced emphasis over orchestra and audience in his series of mozart concerts he proved himself one of the finest mozart interpreters in the world today he a master of the beethoven idiom his reading of sibelius was as truthful to the character of the music as if he had been reared in finland the birthplace of his exceptionally able wife herself a playwright she is a baroness and the second mrs dixon his former wife is an american there are three dixon children martin long a leading australian critic writes dixon looks like a good man for the task on all counts he is a first rate conductor who already has proved his ability to vitalize this orchestra charles dean dixon the son of immigrants from the west indies was born in new york  years ago his mother set him to studying the violin early he loathed the practicing and purposely broke strings she always had a few extras until one day he found and cut them all now you just sit here for four hours doing nothing she ordered the boy sat it out and decided that it was worse than practicing when he was  his violin teacher told deans mother your boy has no talent then i guess well hae him become a doctor she reflected and added firmly but hes not giving up his music in his public school music courses he learned to play every instrument of the orchestra when he was in high school he organized an amateur orchestra in a harlem ymca basement its concerts were so well received that the head of the high school music department urged him to become a professional by this time he could play the violin well enough to win a scholarship at the famed juilliard institute and for seven years he studied there and at columbia university he didnt give up his neighborhood orchestra and eventually  men women boys and girls were playing with him all for fun friends came to his financial aid and the dean dixon symphony concerts became prideful events in the district ticket sales met most of the expenses persons without money were admitted free an official of the national broadcasting co heard the orchestra and dixon then in his early twenties received some substantial assignments as guest conductor as a leader of the national youth administration orchestra in the s he enhanced his reputation in  a few students of city college of new york asked dixon to enroll them in a new orchestra and lead themwithout pay of course that was the start of the amercan youth orchestra a vigorous and proficient outfit which operating on a minimal budget won the nations admiration within a few months it had nearly  members and gave  to  concerts a year some of them in carnegie hall but most of them in the new york poorer neighborhoods where most  residents never had a chance to hear good live music we never failed to win an audience dixon recalled as soon as we finished playing the people would crowd around us and ask when will you be back  a dean dixon concert was not an ordinary exhibition before going into a neighborhood to give a concert he had the entire community prepare for it he formed a dozen committees to type and mimeograph the circulars and pro grams to distribute the tickets to deliver chairs and other equipment and so on that made it really their event in the s he became an outstanding educator too he taught conducting at juilliard and worked with many young peoples groups on music making and appreciation in  he led several hundred wisconsin pupils in the annual summer music clinic at madison he worked them as they had never been worked before and they took it with a smile and a demand for more every day they had to play a new piece the average person isnt going to become a heifetz or rubinstein so why work for six long months on one long masterpeice he argued let him work on many masterpieces do you spend six months reading one book a man of quiet speech and mild manners he had a way in handling youngsters to a boisterous or talkative youth he said play your part from beginning to end alone when this was done he told the lad now you can talk while we play in one of his classes the students took turns at leading an orchestra one youth had an exalted opinion of his own genius and took no care to conceal it just before that boys turn on the podium dixon quietly told some of the players to tune their instruments a half interval below the others the vain boy directed the entire number without noticing the odd harmonies after he was told of the discrepancy in the pitch he was a more subdued student dixon himself has a phenomenally acute ear when he holds auditions he turns his back to the candidates he doesnt care what they look like he wants to know only how they play at times he has told an unseen aspirant that violin youre playingdidnt someone else play it yesterday the answer was yes although he was guest conductor of many leading american orchestras he received no offers of a full time post and in  he moved to paris and then to sweden where he led the goteborg orchestra then he began to extend his career over the continent at the venice summer festival of  he became a sensation the venetians who came out of curiosity remained to cheer the critic of ii gazettino a difficult man to please praised the dixon technical precision values in his first two years in europe he performed  american works by composers such as charles ives and wallingford riegger who were unknown abroad two years ago he was named general director of the hessian radio orchestra of frankfort in his first season the reviewers noted that he caused the musicians to play as if transformed today the end of his long absence from his native land does not seem near but eventually he hopes he will return as the leader of his own orchestra 
george washington northwest city builder
by bob karolevitz
he state of washington
is named after the
nations first president
but another george
washington son of a
slave and jackofalltrades was
one of the most prominent and
successful pioneers of the pacific
ris
northwest commonwealth
the george washington who
came west founded a bustling city
made a small fortune in real estate
and otherwise conquered the odds
which were with him from the
start
his life ran the gamut of a
youthful struggle for education the
hardships of the frontier the stinging
rebuffs of prejudice and the
ultimate warm glow of success
fortunate circumstances and his
own great courage helped him to
break through the onyx curtain of
his generation and to achieve the
wealth and stature denied to so
many other negroes of the th
century
 george was born on august 
 in historic frederick county
virginia he received his surname
from his fathers master and some
 students of the past have speculated that the washingtons involved might have been closely related to the gallant general of mount vernon the youngster was just a baby when his father was sold to a new owner and tiny george was taken into the home of mr and mrs james e cochrane this white couple ultimately adopted him a move which later subjected the cochranes to a great deal of ridicule in that era of racial bitterness when the boy was four the cochranes moved to the ohio frontier and later on into northern missouri because of his color young washington was denied formal schooling but mrs cochrane proved to be a better teacher than he might have found in an organized classroom with a tattered bible and old hymnals as textbooks she taught him to read she and her husband tutored him in arithmetic too and before he was  george could mentally compute land measures faster than his contemporaries could get the answers with a pencil stub while the tecumseh plot for a grand western indian alliance had been foiled years before by william henry harrison at tippecanoe george washington grew up in an atmosphere of ready alert jim cochrane saw to it that he became an expert with a rifle because the possibilities of hostile indian attack were always imminent in bloomington mo cochrane operated a grist mill and a whiskey distillery later he opened a sawmill not only did george washingtons alert teenage mind soak up the rudiments of these trades but he also learned bricklaying and tailoring when he was  george decided to strike out on his own after a short time in illinois during which he failed to make his fortune in the real estate business washington rented a sawmill near the present city of st joseph mo it was hereaway from the cochranesthat he first learned the real meaning of prejudice he sold some goods to a white man named jeremiah coyle whose note he accepted in good faith when the note came due coyle refused to pay and washington sued coyle then took advantage of an earlier law and had george arrested on the grounds that as a free man of color he had no rights in the state of missouri jim cochrane heard of his adopted sons plight and immediately circulated a petition requesting the rights of citizenship for the young man in  the legislature granted those rightsless that of holding public office in the meantime the mill he had operated flooded out so washington purchased equipment to make whiskey then the legislature which had so recently aided him passed another law this one prohibiting a person of color from manufacturing handling or selling spirituous liquors washington disgustedly moved to quincy ill already severely irritated by the limitations placed on him in missouri he learned that the illinois legislature had just passed a law requiring any colored person entering that state with intentions of staying must post a bond of  to guarantee his good behavior this was more than george could stand he went directly to the cochranes and told them that he was going to oregon to find a place in the world if there was any where a negro would be treated as a man his foster parents decided that theyd go too with a wagon and a light carriage four oxen two span of horses and several canadian ponies they went first to council bluffs iowa on may   they set out with a wagon train on the long overland journey a story has it that on the trip a triggerhappy renegade in their party shot an indian squaw a war party threatened annihilation of the wagon train unless the villain was surrendered being at the mercy of the indians the travelers had little choice but to hand over the slayer and then they watched aghast as the indians skinned him alive and threw his body in a fire the journey took  days before the party crossed the cascade range at barlows pass and arrived in oregon city washington helped the cochranes establish a home  and then took a job cutting timber for  a month the rigors of the trip the new climate and the hard work finally caught up with the yearold frontiersman and he fell desperately ill again it was the cochranes who came to his rescue and nursed him back to health with george strong again the family moved northward to cowlitz landing in the present state of washington again the young man helped his foster parents get settled before he looked for a home of his own his search finally took him to a verdant spot where the skookumchuck river joins the chehalis this had been an indian summer home and burial grounds and from his earlier real estate experience washington had learned that the juncture of two rivers made an ideal spot for settlement he immediately staked a claim for  acres then he learned that prejudice had marched westward with him the oregon legislature had approved a law making the settlement of negroes and mulattos in the territory illegal so jim cochrane filed on washingtons land to protect it for him together they raised cattle and operated an inn and a river ferry in  the same year that oregon became a state jim cochrane died only the death of mrs cochrane two years later affected washington more deeply they had devoted their lifetime to the care of a deserted negro youngster and the recipient of their love and devotion recognized all too well the sacrifices their choice in life had entailed before cochrane died george had given him  for the original claim when the laws of washington territory created in  did not bar ownership by a negro he later added  more acres to the original holdings by filing a claim and paying  an acre with his foster parents gone washington lived alone for several yearsfarming lumbering and improving his land when he was  he met and married his first wife an attractive widow who had been born of negro and jewish parents this was a happy union of  years before she died in  meanwhile the two of them began to reap the rewards of georges foresight by  the northern pacific railroad had edged northward to the chehalis river and the homestead which george washington had so carefully selected lay right astride the line on january   washington appeared before the territorial auditor and filed his intentions of laying out a new town he started modestly with four square blocks which he platted into lots  ft by  ft these he sold for  a lot at the same time making each purchaser agree to erect a building on the property at a cost of no less than  to counter the rivalry of other young towns in the territory washington who controlled all the ideal property set aside park land and two acres for a cemetery he dedicated  foot streets and foot alleys for public use and he gave choice building lots for churches of his holdings he reserved  acres for his home with mary jane and her son stacey to make the town of centerville more attractive to new residents washington later doubled the size of his lots and the little village began to grow by the time washington became a state in  the population was nearing a thousand two years later george washington had sold his th lot and combined with his other incomes he had amassed  meanwhile the residents of washingtons town decided that they didnt like the name centerville primarily because it was too easy to confuse with other western towns of the same name a public meeting was called and a teamster newly arrived from centralia ill convinced the citizens that they should adopt the name of his former hometown in  following the death of his first wife washington married charity brown a year later his only child george cleveland washington was bom soon afterwards the couple separated and the yearold father assumed the additional task of raising a son george washington had always worked hard and even though he had a great deal of money by the standards of the times he continued to do manual labor when it was called for he had personally hewn the timbers for the centralia baptist church to which he belonged and he worked on numerous construction projects around the busy little city and then came the panic of  like other young western settlements centralia took on the aura of a ghost town the simmons iron works and the lumber mills shut down or curtailed employment severely to save the town george washington became a oneman relief society he made wagon trips to portland and brought back rice flour and sugar by the ton from the packing plant in chehalis he purchased large quantities of side bacon and lard as a man who could still make a shirt in an hourandahalf including buttons and buttonholes he worked to provide clothing and shoes for his less fortunate neighbors he lent considerable sums of money without interest and with no terms for repayment but mainly he provided work so that his beneficiaries did not accept his offerings as pridedamaging charity but as an exchange for a days labor washington further saved the town from bankruptcy or absentee ownership by buying up property which went on  the auction block his faith in his city paid off in  when the tide changed not only for centralia but for george washington too by the turn of the century he was a wealthy and respected citizen of the state alert and always planning for the future in spite of his age washington was active in business until august of  then in an accident not uncommon in those days he was thrown from his buggy by a runaway horse and injured critically three weeks later on august  he died in his th year his funeral was the biggest in centralias history as the mayor proclaimed a day of mourning services were help in the baptist church he helped to build on the ground he had donated he was buried in the cemetery he had deeded to the city beside him were the bodies of james cochrane and his wife whom george had thoughtfully moved to the family plot with the help of his devoted foster parents washington had risen above the limitations set for his race in an era of prejudice and injustice today he is virtually a legendary figure in his city and his adopted state stories are told about his strong aversion to paper money which grew folks say out of the time he saw a  bill blow into a roaring fireplace after that he dealt only in gold and silver once he supposedly withdrew a wheelbarrow full of money from a local bank when he became fearful of the banks soundness it is still rumored that he buried the money somewhere around centralia and never told anyone of the location in his later years he was still sharpeyed and adept with a rifle and could riddle a tin can tossed into the air with a revolver his only vanity consisted of two wigs a brown one for week days and a black one for sunday though his stature in his home community was great he did not entirely escape the reminders of his lowly birth today one of centralias streets grew out of a conflict with one of his neighbors james tullis a southerner tullis vowed that his fence would never touch washingtons so he erected it six feet inside his own property not to be outdone george also built his fence six feet from the plat line and the resultant foot spite strip became known as tullis lane george washington  pioneer builder and entrepreneurmight have been handicapped by his borrowed name his color and his backwoods education but he chose to accent the positive today a thriving city stands as a living monument to his long struggle against moralecracking odds hed have preferred that to statues 
by dwight macdonald 
his significantly titled the 
affluent society  pro 
 
fessor j k galbraith states 
that poverty in this country 
is no longer a massive 
affliction but more nearly an after 
thought dr galbraith is a humane critic 
of the american capitalist system and he 
is generously indignant about the con 
tinued existence of even this nonmassive and afterthoughtish poverty but the interesting thing about his pronouncement aside from the fact that it is inaccurate is that it was generally accepted as obvious for a long time now almost everybody has assumed that because of the new deals social legislation and more inportantthe prosperity we have enjoyed since  mass poverty no longer exists in this country dr galbraith states that our poor have dwindled to two hardcore categories one is the insular poverty of those who live in the rural south or in depressed areas like west virginia the other category is case poverty which he says is commonly and properly related to such characteristics of the individuals so afflicted as mental deficiency bad health inability to adapt to the discipline of modern economic life excessive procreation alcohol insufficient education he reasons that such poverty must be due to individual defects since nearly everyone else has mastered his environment this proves that it is not intractable without pressing the similarity of this concept to the social darwinism whose fallacies dr galbraith easily disposes of elsewhere in his book one may observe that most of these characteristics are as much the result of poverty as its cause dr galbraiths error is understandable and common last april the newspapers reported some exhilarating statistics in a department of commerce study the average family income increased from   in  to  in  these figures are calculated in current dollars as are all the others i shall cite but the papers did not report the fine type so to speak which showed that almost all the recent gain was made by families with income of over  and that the rate at which poverty is being eliminated has slowed down alarmingly since  only the specialists and the statisticians read the fine type which is why illusions continue to exist about american poverty now michael harrington an alumnus of the catholic worker and the fund for the republic who is at present a contributing editor of dissent and the chief editor of the socialist party biweekly new america has written the other america poverty in the united states macmillan in the admirably short space of under two hundred pages he outlines the problem describes in imaginative detail what it means to be poor in this country today summarizes the findings of recent studies by economists and sociologists and analyzes the reasons for the persistence of mass poverty in the midst of general prosperity in the last year we seem to have suddenly awakened  rubbing our eyes like rip van winkle to the fact that mass poverty persists and that it is one of our two gravest social problems the other is related while only eleven per centof our population is nonwhite twentyfive per cent of our poor are what is poverty it is a historically relative concept first of all there are new definitions in america of what man can achieve of what a human standard of life should be mr harrington writes those who suffer levels of life well below those that are possible even though they live better than medieval knights or asian peasants are poor    poverty should be defined in terms of those who are denied the minimal levels of health housing food and education that our present stage of scientific knowledge specifies for life as it is now lived in the united states his dividing line follows that proposed in recent studies by the united states bureau of labor statistics  a year for a family of four and  for an individual living alone all kinds of income are included such as food grown and consumed on farms this is the cutoff line generally drawn today mr harrington estimates that between forty and fifty million americans or about a fourth of the population are now living in poverty not just below the level of comfortable living but real poverty in the oldfashioned sense of the wordthat they are hard put to it to get the mere necessities beginning with enough to eat this is difficult to believe in the united states of  but one has to make the effort and it is now being made the extent of our poverty has sud denly become visible the same thing has happened in england where workingclass gains as a result of the labour partys post welfare state blinded almost everybody to the continued existence of mass poverty it was not until professor richard m titmuss of the london school of economics published a series of articles in the new statesman last fall based on his new book income distribution and social change allen  unwin that even the liberal public in england became aware that the problem still persists on a scale that is statistically significant as the economists put it the limits of statistics statistics on poverty are even trickier than most for example age and geography make a difference there is a distinction which cannot be rendered arithmetically between poverty and low income a childless young couple with  a year is not poor in the way an elderly couple might be with the same income the young couples statistical poverty may be temporary inconvenience if the husband is a graduate student or a skilled worker there are prospects of later affluence or at least comfort but the old couple can look forward only to diminishing earnings and increasing medical expenses so also geographically a family of four in a small town with  a year may be better off than a like family in a citylower rent no bus fares to get to work fewer occasions or temptations to spend money even more so with a rural family although allowance is made for the value of the vegetables they may raise to feed themselves it is impossible to calculate how much money they dont spend on clothes say or furniture because they dont have to keep up with the joneses lurking in the crevices of a city like piranha fish in a brazilian stream are numerous tempting opportunities for expenditure small but voracious which can strip a budget to its bones in a surprisingly short time how many poor it is not therefore surprising to find that there is some disagreement about just how many millions of americans are poor the point is that all recent studies agree that american poverty is still a mass phenomenon thus the commerce departments april report estimates there are  families and unattached individuals with incomes of less than  how many of the latter are there poverty and deprivation see page  puts the number of single persons with under  at  let us say that in the  under  there are  single personsthe proportion of unattached individuals tends to go down as income rises this homemade estimate gives us  familes with incomes of under   figuring the average american family at thiee and a half personswhich it isthis makes  individuals in families or a grand total if we add in the  unattached individuals with under  a year of  americans now living in poverty which is close to a fourth of the total population the reason dr galbraith was able to see poverty as no longer a massive affliction is that he used a cutoff of  which even in »   when it was adopted in a congressional study was probably too low the cio argued for  and in  when the affluent society appeared was simply fantastic the model postwar budgets drawn up in  by the bureau of labor statistics to maintain a level of adequate living give a concrete idea of what poverty means in this countryor would mean if poor families lived within their income and spent it wisely which they dont dr kolko summarizes the kind of living these budgets provide three members of the family see a movie once every three weeks and one member sees a movie once every two weeks there is no telephone in the house but the family makes three pay calls a week they buy one book a year and write one letter a week the father buys one heavy wool suit every two years and a light wool suit every three years the wife one suit every ten years or one skirt every five years every three or four years depending on the distance and time involved the family takes a vacation outside their own city in  the family spent a total of  to  on all types of home furnishings electrical appliances and laundry equipment    the family eats cheaper cuts of meat several times a week but has more expensive cuts on holidays the entire family consumes a total of two fivecent ice cream cones one fivecent candy bar two bottles of soda and one bottle of beer a week the family owes no money but has no savings except for a small insurance policy one other item is included in the bls maintenance budget a new car every twelve to eighteen years this is an ideal picture drawn up by social workers of how a poor family should spend its money but the poor are much less provident installment debts take up a lot of their cash and only a statistician could expect an actual live woman however poor to buy new clothes at intervals of five or ten years also one suspects that a lot more movies are seen and icecream cones and bottles of beer are consumed than in the spartan ideal but these necessary items are had only at the cost of displacing other itemsnecessary so to speakin the bls budget the conference on economic progresss poverty and deprivation deals not only with the poor  but also with another large section of the underprivileged which is an american euphemism almost as good as senior citizen namely the  persons whose family income is between  and  and the  singles who have from  to  the authors define deprivation as above poverty but short of minimum requirements for a modestly comfortable level of living they claim that  americans or almost half the population live in poverty or deprivation one recalls the furor roosevelt aroused with his onethird of a nation illhoused illclad illnourished but the political climate was different then the distinction between a family income of  poverty and  deprivation is not vivid to those who run thingsthe  per cent whose incomes are between  and  and the  per cent of the topmost top dogs who get  or more these two minorities sizable enough to feel they are the nation have been as unaware of the continued existence of mass poverty as this reviewer was until he read mr harringtons book they are businessmen congressmen judges government officials politicians lawyers doctors engineers scientists editors journalists and administrators in colleges churches and foundations since their education income and social status are superior they if anybody might be expected to accept responsibility for what the constitution calls the general welfare they have not done so in the case of the poor and they have a good excuse it is becoming harder and harder simply to see the onefourth of our fellowcitizens who live below the poverty line the poor are increasingly slipping out of the very experience and consciousness of the nation mr harrington writes if the middle class never did like ugliness and poverty it was at least aware of them across the tracks was not a very long way to go    now the american city has been transformed the poor still inhabit the miserable housing in the central area but they are increasingly isolated from contact with or sight of anybody else    living out in the suburbs it is easy to assume that ours is indeed an affluent society  clothes make the poor invisible too america has the bestdressed poverty the world has ever known    it is much easier in the united states to be decently dressed than it is to be decently housed fed or doctored  many of the poor are the wrong age to be seen a good number of them are sixtyfive years of age or better an even larger number are under eighteen    and finally the poor are politically invisible they are without lobbies of their own they put forward no legislative program as a group they are atomized they have no face they have no voice    only the social agencies have a really direct involvement with the other america and they are without any great political power    forty to fifty million people are becoming increasingly invisible these invisible people fall mostly into the following categories some of them overlapping poor farmers who operate  per cent of the farms and get  per cent of the farm cash income migratory farm workers unskilled unorganized workers in offices hotels restaurants hospitals laundries and other service jobs inhabitants of areas where poverty is either endemic peculiar to a people or district as in the rural south or epidemic prevalent among a community at a special time and produced by some special causes as in west virginia where the special cause was the closing of coal mines and steel plants negroes and puerto ricans who are a fourth of the total poor the alcoholic derelicts in the bigcity skid rows the hillbillies from kentucky tennessee and oklahoma who have migrated to midwestern cities in search of better jobs and finally almost half our senior citizens the wrong color the most obvious citizens of the other america are those whose skins are the wrong color the folk slogans are realistic last to be hired first to be fired and if youre black stay back there has been some progress in  the nonwhite workers wage averaged  per cent of the white workers by  it had climbed to  per cent a famous victory but the nonwhites still average only slightly more than half as much as the whites even this modest gain was due not to any rooseveltian or trumanian social reform but merely to the fact that for some years there was a war on and workers were in demand whether black white or violet by  the nonwhites had achieved most of their advanceto  per cent of white earnings which means they have gained in the last fifteen years just  per cent the least obvious poverty affects our senior citizensthose over sixtyfive mr harrington estimates that half of them live in poverty and he thinks they are even more atomized and politically helpless than the rest of the other america he estimates that onefourth of the unrelated individuals among them or a million persons have less than  a year which is about what is allotted for food alone in the department of agricultures minimumsubsistence budget the average american family now spends only  per cent of its income for foodan indication of the remarkable prosperity we are all enjoying except for onequarter of us one can imagine or perhaps one cant what it would be like to live on  a year or  a week it is only fair  to note that most of our senor citizens do better the average per capita income of those over sixtyfive is now estimated to be slightly over  a week that is  a year the aged poor have two sources of income besides their earnings or savings one is contributions by relatives a  white house conference report put this at  per cent of income which works out to  a week for an income of and the  aged poor all have less than that the other is social security whose benefits in  averaged  a week even this modest sum is more than any of the under got since payments are proportionate to earnings and the poor of course earned less than the rest a quarter of them and those in general the neediest are not covered by social security the last resort is relief and mr harrington describes most vividly the humiliations the poor often have to put up with to get that the whole problem of poverty and the aged is especially serious today because americans are living longer in the first half of this century life expectancy increased  years for men and  years for women and between  and  the oversixtyfive group increased twice as fast as the population as a whole the worst part of being old and poor in this country is the loneliness mr harrington notes that we have not only racial ghettos but geriatric ones in the cheap roominghouse districts of large cities he gives one peculiarly disturbing statistic onethird of the aged in the united states some  or more human beings have no phone in their place of residence they are literally cut off from the rest of america ernest hemingways celebrated deflation of scott fitzgeralds romantic notion that the rich are different somehowyes they have moneydoesnt apply to the poor they are different in more important ways than their lack of money as mr harrington demonstrates  emotional upset is one of the main forms of the vicious circle of impoverishment the structure of the society is hostile to these people the poor tend to become pessimistic and depressed they seek immediate gratification instead of saving they act out once this mood this unarticulated philosophy becomes a fact society can change the recession can end and yet there is no motive for movement the depression has become internalized the middle class looks upon this process and sees lazy people who just dont want to get ahead people who are much too sensitive to demand of cripples that they run races ask of the poor that they get up and act like everyone else in the society the poor are not like everyone else    they think and feel differently they look upon a different america than the middle class looks upon the poor are also different in a physical sense they are much less healthy according to poverty and deprivation the proportion of those disabled or limited in their major activity by chronic ill health rises sharply as income sinks in reasonably welloff families  and up  per cent are so disabled in reasonably poor families  to  the proportion doubles to  per cent and in unreasonably poor familes under  it doubles again to  per cent an obvious cause among others for the very poor being four times as much disabled by chronic ill health as the welltodo is that they have much less money to spend for medical care in fact almost nothing this weighs with special heaviness on the aged poor during the fifties mr harrington notes all costs on the consumer price index went up by  per cent but medical costs that terrible staple of the aged went up by  per cent hospitalization rose by  per cent and group hospitalization costs blue cross premiums were up by  per cent the defeat of medicare this last figure is particularly interesting since blue cross and such plans are the amas alternative to socialized medicine or rather to the timid fumblings toward it that even our most liberal politicians have dared to propose such figures throw an unpleasant light on the senates rejection of medicare the defeat was all the more bitter because in the usual effort to appease the conservatives with the usual lack of successonly five republicans and only four southern democrats voted pro the bill was watered down in advance not until he had spent  of his own moneywhich is  per cent of the annual income of some  aged poorwould a patient have been eligible and the original program included only people already covered by social security or railroad retirement pensions and excluded the neediest of all  aged poor who are left out of both these systems mental as well as physical illness is much greater among the poor even though our complacent cliche is that nervous breakdowns are a prerogative of the rich because the poor cant afford them they cant but they have them anyway this bit of middleclass folklore should be laid to rest by a study made in new haven social class and mental illness by august b hollingshead and frederick c redlich wiley they found that the rate of treated psychiatric illness is about the same from the rich down through decently paid workersan average of  per  but in the bottom fifth it shoots up to  per  there is an even more striking difference in the kind of mental illness of those in the four top in come groups who had undergone psychiatric treatment  per cent had been treated for neurotic problems and  per cent for psychotic disturbances in the bottom fifth the treated illnesses were almost all psychotic  per cent this shows there is something to the notion that the poor cant afford nervous breakdownsthe milder kind that issince the reason the proportion of treated neuroses among the poor is only  per cent is that a neurotic can keep going after a fashion but the argument cuts deeper the other way the  poor go to a psychiatrist or more commonly are committed to a mental institution only when they are completely unable to function because of psychotic symptoms therefore even that nearly threefold increase in mental disorders among the poor is probably an underestimate the main reason the american poor have become invisible is that since  their numbers have been reduced by twothirds astounding as it may seem the fact is that president roosevelts onethird of a nation was a considerable understatement over twothirds of us then lived below the poverty line as is shown by the tables that follow but today the poor are a minority and minorities can be ig  nored if they are so heterogeneous that they cannot be organized when the poor were a majority they simply could not be overlooked poverty is also hard to see today because the middle class  to  has vastly increasedfrom  per cent of all families in  to a nearmajority  per cent today that mass poverty can persist despite this rise to affluence is hard to believe or see especially if one is among those who have risen two tables in poverty and deprivation summarize what has been happening in the last thirty years they cover only multipleperson families all figures are converted to  dollars and the income is before taxes i have omitted for clarity all fractions the first table is the percentage of families with a given income  under      to      to      to    over    several interesting conclusions can be drawn from these tables  the new deal didnt do anything about poverty the under  families in  were  per cent of the total population which was slightly more than the  figure of  per cent  the war economy hot and cold did do something about poverty between  and  the proportion of all families who were poor reduced from  per cent to  per cent  if the percentage of under families decreased by twothirds between  and  their share of the national income dropped a great deal morefrom  per cent to  per cent  the welltodo  to  have enormously increased from  per cent of all families in  to  per cent today the rich  and over have also multipliedfrom  to  per cent but it should be noted that the very rich according to another new study the share of top wealthholders in national wealth  by robert j lampman princeton have experienced a decline he finds that the top  per cent of wealthholders owned  per cent of the national wealth in  and own only  per cent today  the reduction of poverty has slowed down in the six years  the number of poor families declined  per cent but in the following seven years only  per cent the economic stasis that set in with eisenhower and that still persists under kennedy was responsible this stagnation however did not affect the over families who increased from  per cent to  per cent between  and  in the new york times magazine for last november th herman p miller of the bureau of the census wrote during the forties the lowerpaid occupations made the greatest relative gains in average income laborers and service workers    had increases of about     and professional and managerial workers the highest paid workers of all had the lowest relative gains  but in the last decade the trend has been reversed laborers and service workers have gained  while professionalmanagerial workers have gained  this is because in the wartime forties the unskilled were in great demand while now they are being replaced by machines automation is today the same kind of menace to the unskilledthat is the poorthat the enclosure movement was to the british agricultural population centuries ago the facts show that our social revolution ended nearly twenty years ago mr miller concludes yet important segments of the american public many of them highly placed government officials and prominent educators think and act as though it were a continuing process the post decrease in poverty was not due to the policies or actions of those who are not poor those in positions of power and responsibility the war economy needed workers wages went up and the poor became less poor when economic stasis set in the rate of decrease in poverty slowed down proportionately and it is still  slow kennedys efforts to get the country moving again has been unsuccessful possibly because he has despite the suggestions of many of his economic advisers not yet advocated the one big step that might push the economy off dead center a massive increase in government spending this would be politically courageous perhaps even dangerous because of the superstitious fear of deficit spending and an unbalanced federal budget american folklore insists that a governments budget must be arranged like a private familys walter lippmann wrote after the collapse of the stock market last spring there is mounting evidence that those economists were right who told the administration last winter that it was making the mistake of trying to balance the budget too soon it will be said that the budget is not balanced it shows a deficit in fiscal  of  billion    but    the budget that matters is the department of commerces income and product accounts budget nobody looks at it except the economists but while the administrative budget is necessary for administration and is like a mans checkbook the income budget tells the real story    it shows that at the end of  the outgo and ingo accounts will be virtually in balance with a deficit of only about half a billion dollars thus in reality the kennedy administration is no longer stimulating the economy and the economy is stagnating for lack of stimulation we have one of the lowest rates of growth among the advanced industrial nations of the world one shouldnt be hard on the president franklin roosevelt a more daring and experimental politician at least in his domestic policy listened to the american disciples of j m keynes in the early new deal years and unbalanced his budgets with splendid results but by  he had lost his nerve he cut back government spending and there ensued the  recession from which the economy recovered only when war orders began to make up for the deficiency in domestic buying power poverty and deprivation estimates that between  and  the annual growth rate of our economy was only  per cent per annum contrasted with an estimated  per cent required to maintain utilization of manpower and other productive resources the poor who always experience the worst the first understand quite personally the meaning of that dry statistic as they understand kiplings the toad beneath the harrow knowsexactly where each toothpoint goes they are also most intimately acquainted with another set of statistics the steady postwar rise in the unemployment rate from  per cent in  to  per cent in  to  per cent in  to over  per cent in  the tory government is worried because british unemployment is now at its highest point for the last three years this point is  per cent which is less than our lowest rate in the last fifteen years its not that public opinion doesnt become aroused every now and then but the arousement never leads to much it was aroused twentyfour years ago when john steinbeck published the grapes of wrath but mr harrington reports that things in the imperial valley are still much the same low wages bad housing no effective union public opinion is too public that is too general of its very nature it can have no sustained interest in california agriculture the only groups with such a continuing interest are the workers and the farmers who hire them once public opinion ceased to be aroused the battle was again between the two antagonists with a real personal stake in the outcome and there was no question about which was stronger so with the rural poor in general in the late fifties the average annual wage for white male american farm worker was slightly over  women children negroes and mexicans got less one recalls edward r murrows celebrated television program about these people harvest of shame once more everybody was shocked but the harvest is still shameful one also recalls that mr murrow after president kennedy had appointed him head of the united states information agency tried to persuade the bbc not to show harvest of shame his argument was that it would give an undesirable image of america to foreign audiences there is a monotony about the injustices suffered by the poor that perhaps accounts for the lack of interest the rest of society shows in them everything seems to go wrong with them they never win its just boring address unknown public housing turns out not to be for them the  housing act authorized  new units of lowcost housing in the following four years twelve years later in  the aflcio proposed  units to complete the lagging  program the kennedy administration ventured to recommend  to congress thus instead of  lowcost units by  the poor will get if they are lucky  by  and they are more likely to be injured than helped by slum clearance since the new projects usually have higher rents than the displaced slumdwellers can afford there has been no dearth of governmentfinanced middle income housing since  these refugees from the bulldozers for the most part simply emigrate to other slums they also become invisible mr harrington notes that half of them are recorded as address unknown several years ago charles  abrams who was new york state rent administrator under harriman and who is now president of the national committee against discrimination in housing summed up what he had learned in two decades in public housing once social reforms have won tonal appeal in the public mind their slogans and goalsymbols may degenerate into tools of the dominant class for beleaguering the minority and often for defeating the very aims which the original sponsors had intended for their reforms and this is not the end of tribulation the poor who can least afford to lose pay because of ill health lose the most a national health survey made a few years ago found that workers earning under  a year had twice as many restrictedactivity days as those earning over  although they are the most in need of hospital insurance the poor have the least since they cant afford the premiums only  per cent of poor families have it as against  per cent of all families it should be noted however that the poor who are war veterans can get free treatment at government expense in veterans administration hospitals the poor actually pay more taxes in proportion to their income than the rich a recent study by the tax foundation estimates that  per cent of incomes under  goes for taxes as against  per cent of the income of families earning five to seven times as much sales and other excise taxes are largely responsible for this curious statistic it is true that such taxes fall impartially on all like the blessed rain from heaven but it is a form of egalitarianism that perhaps only senator goldwater can fully appreciate the final irony is that the welfare state which roosevelt erected and which eisenhower no matter how strongly he felt about it didnt attempt to pull down is not for the poor either agricultural workers are not covered by social security nor are many of the desperately poor among the aged such as unrelated individuals with incomes of less than  of whom only  per cent are covered which is just half the percentage of coverage among the aged in general of the welfare state mr harrington says its creation had been stimulated by mass impoverishment and misery yet it helped the poor least of all laws like unemployment compensation the wagner act the various farm programs all these were designed for the middle third in the cities for the organized workers and for the  big market farmers  it benefits those least who need help most the industrial workers led by john l lewis mobilized enough political force to put through section  a of the national industrial recovery act which with the wagner act made the cio possible the big farmers put enough pressure on henry wallace roosevelts first secretary of agriculturewho talked a good fight for liberal principles but was a hamlet when it came to actionto establish the two basic propositions of welfare state agriculture subsidies that now cost  billion a year and that chiefly benefit the big farmers and the exclusion of sharecroppers tenant farmers and migratory workers from the protection of minimumwage and social security laws no doubt the kennedy administration would like to do more for the poor than it has but it is hampered by the cabal of republicans and southern democrats in congress the  revision of the fair labor standards act which raised the national minimum wage to the not exorbitant figure of  an hour was a slight improvment over the previous act for instance it increased coverage of retailtrade workers from  per cent to  per cent but onefourth of the retail workers still excluded earn less than  an hour there was also a considerable amount of shadowboxing involved of the  workers newly covered only  were making less than   an hour and there was the exclusion of a particularly illpaid group of workers nobody had anything against the laundry workers personally it was just that they were weak unorganized and politically expendable to appease the conservatives in congress whose votes were needed to get the revision through they were therefore expended the result is that of the  workers in the laundry drycleaning and dyeing industries just  are now protected by the fair labor standards act perpetuating poverty it seems likely that mass poverty will continue in this country for a long time the more it is reduced the harder it is to keep on reducing it the poor having dwindled from twothirds of the population in  to onequarter today no longer are a significant political force as is shown by the senates rejection of medicare and by the democrats dropping it as an issue in the elections last year also as poverty decreases those left behind tend more and more to be the ones who have for so long accepted poverty as their destiny that they need outside help to climb out of it this new minority mass poverty so much more isolated and hopeless than the old majority poverty shows signs of becoming chronic the permanence of low incomes is inferred from a variety of findings write the authors of the morgan survey in many poor families the head has never earned enough to cover the familys present needs for most families however the problem of chronic poverty is serious one such family is headed by a thirtytwoyearold man who is employed as a dishwasher though he works steadily and more than full time he earned over  in  his wife earned  more but their combined incomes are not enough to support themselves and their three children although the head of the family is only thirtytwo he feels that he has no chance of advancement partly because he finished only seven grades of school    the possibility of such families leaving the ranks of the poor is not high children born into poor families today have less chance of improving themselves than the children of the pre poor rags to riches is now more likely to be rags to rags indeed the morgan book concludes it appears that a number of the heads of poor families have moved into less skilled jobs than their fathers had over a third of the children of the poor according to the survey dont go beyond the eighth grade and will probably perpetuate the poverty of their parents there are a great many of these children in an important study of poverty made for a congressional committee in  dr robert j lampman estimated that eleven million of the poor were under eighteen a considerable number of younger persons are starting life in a condition of inherited poverty  he observed to which mr harrington adds the character of poverty has changed and it is no longer associated with immigrant groups with high aspirations it is now identified with those whose social existence makes it more and more difficult to break out into the larger society even when children from poor families show intellectual promise there is nothing in the values of their friends or families to encourage them to make use of it of the top  per cent of highschool studentsthose scoring  and over in iq testsonly half go on to college the explanation for this amazingand alarming situation is as much cultural as economic the children of the poor now tend to lack what the sociologists call motivation at least one foundation is working on the problem of why so many bright children from poor families dont ever try to go beyond high school mr raymond m hilliard at present director of the cook county ie chicago department of public aid and formerly commissioner of welfare for new york city recently directed a representativesample investigation which showed that more than half of the n  ablebodied cook county residents who were on relief were functionally illiterate one reason cook county has to spend  a month on relief is the lack of basic educational skills of relief recipients which are essen i tial to compete in our modern society an interesting footnote apropos of recent happenings at ole miss is that the illiteracy rate of the relief recipients who were educated in chicago is  per cent while among those who were educated in mississippi and later moved to chicago it is  percent
