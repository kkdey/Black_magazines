are negroes culture shy by fletcher e dalton am constantly appalled b y and concerned over the absence of negro patrons at events of general cultural importance in this country so seldom are there negroes attending events relating to the fine arts concerts lectures plays ballet that when i see a mere handful i feel especially blessed to what can this condition be attributed one excludes here the student and teacher of the arts although their representation is small whose interest after all is professional it is the general public with which i am concerned although negroes are frequently encountered at vocal performances along the eastern and western coasts opera and song recitals i have yet to see more than a score per season at orchestral concerts or instrumental recitals i would be willing to wager that not one of the major orchestras in the country can count on more than a dozen negro subscribers the situation worsens where the dramatic stage is concerned it was pathetic to view the small negro audience proportionately speaking which viewed purlie victorious ossie davis uneven but strikingly good comedy which enjoyed an enthusiastic press reaction and was produced on broadway a member of the cast of fly blackbird a play dealing with the race problem deplored the lack of negro attendance in a letter to the new york times patterns differ however in the south obviously discrimination or segregation has been the bar to attendance of things cultural negroes were summarily turned down at the box office except at federally or municipally owned places of entertainment but is this prevailingly the case today i submit that the anticipation of being turned down is enough to deter many wouldbe patrons but if the tickets were secured somehow would they be refused at the door perhaps so my first memory of a concert however is that of a rubenstein recital at womans college in greensboro north carolina at which my father and i were the only negroes present upon presenting our tickets ordered by mail we were shown to our seats with all due courtesy we enjoyed without anxiety or apprehension of any kind one of rubensteins best solo recitals i am sure this could be repeated in many southern cities but some positive effort has to be made on the part of the negroes themselves two years ago after the triumphant debut of leontyne price with the metropolitan opera association of new york when negro patrons were herded into the balcony of an atlanta theatre regardless of ticket location they lodged a protest which brought from general manager rudolf bing the declaration that the met would no longer play before segregated houses some time ago when the national road company of porgy and bess played in north carolina negroes it seems were refused tickets women then borrowed white children and went in great numbers as babysitters i am sure that the presence of negro actors and actresses on both the dramatic and the musical scene is rewarding in itself and that one should get out to see them perform as much as possible to go out only when they appear however is a strangely twisted form of dilettantism rightly one may rave over the performance of diahann carroll in no strings after all she has created the role hollow indeed however is the praise lavished on a price performance of aida an opera given perhaps as many as three times a week by various companies in new york city alone when it comes solely on the basis of vicarious experience through newspaper reviews wordofmouth reports or oneusually the firstvisit to the opera house the world of the fine arts like the world of sports is valid in and for itself it is only highlighted by special performers do we watch baseball games and boxing bouts only when we can directly identify with one of the participants a game by the new york yankees was no less exciting than a dodger game some years ago when the former had no negro players the addition of elston howard and others to the roster has added an extra dimension perhaps but the games are still worth watching even when howard is not in the lineup though we are absolutely glued to the tv when the globetrotters are playing we do not pass up a basketball game because the teams happen to have no negro players one could i suppose build up experience by attending only performances in which negroes appear comparing and contrasting various interpretations of the same role i should imagine that those people who last saw othello with paul robeson are growing rather weary with waiting for another negro to achieve such fabulous prominence in the role one would envy those persons who could afford to commute between paris and spoleto to compare grace bumbrys portrayal of carmen with that of shirley verrettcarter fees demanded by performers are high and there is little or no governmental support for the arts consequently box office prices are often extreme negroes are no longer only in professions at the bottom of the pay scale but even if they were they could afford live performances once in a while naturally one must be selective in the large cultural centers of the northeast and west in the small townships and in the south generally speaking one must take what comes along colleges and universities put on firstrate concert series and many municipal organizations put on free events of great variety if one must pay prices for nearly all cultural events usually begin at or under a fee which many movie houses get nowadays especially when the spectaculars are presented speaking of movies it is said that the nationwide lack of negro patrons at raisin in the sun helped it to be withdrawn much earlier than it would have been what argument can possibly justify this for those who prefer better locations tickets range upward through even to as for the last stated ostentation is everyones privilege for those who decry these prices standing room is frequently available often providing the best overall view in the theatre in short neither high admission prices nor lack of opportunity except in isolated instances can be called effective means of barring negroes from attending high calibre events if it is due to lack of previous exposure the remedy is pleasant and easily attained in a recent statement president kennedy noted that last year more people attended concerts than baseball games without forsaking the latter can we not be more highly represented at the former fepc is not enough by william l becker bout per cent of y the nonwhite citizens of the north and the west are now covered by fair employment practices laws but it is already apparent that laws prohibiting discrimination in employment will not in themselves provide equal employment opportunity for the negro mexicanamerican or puerto rican communities it is probable that no one really expected them to but in any case next steps are now in order the basic approach of fepcs has been that of merit employment the employer is enjoined to hire the best most qualified man regardless of his color or religion or national origin if an individual whatever his race is refused a job because someone better qualified is available the employer is not discriminating in the eyes of the law he is discriminating only if he denies the job to a negro or other minority person who is the best qualified for that job and then gives that job to a caucasian who is less well qualified the problem here is that fepcs prohibit discrimination only at the time when the actual decision to hire or to promote is being made the discrimination and segregation which have taken place for the many generations before that time of decision are not a factor in the law yet the minority person typically brings this historical disadvantage to the employment office on the other hand if an employer who recognizes this background problem wants to make a special point of employing more negro workers he may not place an order with an employment agency asking for negro applicants in many of our fep states he would be violating the law if a labor union wants to make a special effort to get more negroes placed in jobs in its jurisdictionpossibly in the face of some employer resistanceit too may be violating the law especially as it applies to the hiring clause of its contract this is especially ironic in those situations where for years the union has catered to employer requests for an italian speaking worker for this neighborhood or an oriental for atmosphere it is true that an employer may take care to advertise his job needs broadly and especially to get coverage in the minority communitys newspapers and radio stations he may then hope that more minority people will apply for the jobs this is not against the law but if minority people do not respondand this is often the casemust he end his efforts or be in violation of the law the lack of information in the minority communities is a very serious problem if a substantial number of negro workers is put to work in a previously allwhite industry the word eventually gets around but if there is no community experience with this employment opportunity and the employer is relying on the newspapers and the radio the message may not get through communications cannot be good with communities who have so long been alienated from the mainstream of american life lack of complaints the small number of complaints actually filed with the fep commissions is one result of this lack of information and communication the surveys reveal a much greater incidence of discriminatory practices than the number of filed complaints would indicate another weakness that has been revealed in the present fepc structure concerns the complaint procedure most fepc laws are built around the filing of a verified complaint while it is true that many job practices are improved because of the processingpossibly even the filingof one individual complaint it is also true that fep commissions have had to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction lack of evidence or lack of proof at least per cent of the cases filed the trailblazing efforts made by a number of fepc officials where despite a poor case they have found evidence of discrimination with which they were able to deal has been a valuable contribution to the methods of achieving progress but this only highlights their almost complete dependence on complaints and the severe limitations resulting from so few complaints actually being filed a commissions right to initiate action wherever it sees discrimination regardless of whether any complaint has been filed becomes critical under these circumstances a federal law based completely on response to complaints would be most effective in those areas where the minority population has had the most developed aspirations and sense of individual rights in these areas a federal law is needed least in the south on the other hand unless there is an organizational approach to the filing of complaints by the naacp or core or by the southern christian leadership movement few complaints will actually be filed drafters of fepc bills and proponents of fepc bills need to keep these problems in mind those who are attempting to administer present laws are well aware of them need for training but these technical deficiencies of fep laws are dwarfed by the problems of inadequate training in a period when the number of jobsespecially jobs requiring a minimum of skillseem to be declining in the long term curve unskilled and semiskilled males of all groups will be hard pressed to keep steady jobs the negro who is displaced by automation finds his problem compounded by the history of discrimination to which he and his race have for generations been subjected he is unequal to the guarantee of equal opportunity despite his years of hard and conscientious work because in comparison with the white jobhunter he starts with an inferior education and because of prefepc discrimination no experience in those jobs which might now be open to him there are many statistics on the current increase in technological unemployment but a few will suffice here in the last ten years the index of manufacturing has climbed from to but the number of production workers has remained at the level gerard piel publisher of the scientific american writes it is evident that the number is now due to decline the rate of unemployment for negro workers remains constantly about twice that of white workers in about per cent of the white workers in the country were unemployed as against about per cent of nonwhite workers in about per cent of the white workers were unemployed as against about per cent of nonwhite workers in other terms unemployment among nonwhite workers multiplies twice as fast as unemployment among white workers the impact of automation on negroes in skilled jobs is dramatically illustrated by a picture in business week of jan showing clerks being replaced by machines in the spiegel mail order house in chicago in one picture a large number of negro clerks are shown at work in order filling departments in the next picture a few mixed negro and white clerks are at work in a large room filled with machines it is to be noted that mr spiegel obviously has made a special effort to hire more than the usual proportion of negro employeesit is the machine not the white worker who is the competitor but it is minority youth in or just out of high school who are having the most difficulty finding employment youth in general make up a disproportionately large share of the unemployed in a study quoted by dr conant in slums suburbs we find that in june the unemployment rate nationwide is something over per cent for all age brackets but unemployment among youth under twentyone years of age is about per cent or more than twice the nationwide rate for all workers the department of labor has estimated that adolescents will enter the labor market in the sixties which of those will get what jobs exist on the basis of the pattern we see today negro youth will have much the rougher time landing a job dr conant reports in a slum area of people mostly negro a sampling of the youth population showed that roughly per cent of the boys and girls ages sixteen to twentyone were out of school and unemployed when one considers that the total population in this district is equal to that of a goodsized independent city the magnitude of the problem is appalling and the challenge to our society is clear need for counseling unless these negro boys and girls have been much better counseled by their families or their schools than is usually the case the kind of unskilled or service industry jobs they have been thinking of getting may not existfor them or for anyone else donald n michael in cybernation the silent conquest argues that service activities will also tend to displace workers by becoming selfservice by becoming cybernated and by being eliminated there may be other jobs or at least as a result of fepcs there may be other jobs from which they are not barred because of race but they may never have heard of these jobs perhaps they did hear of them but did not consider them early enough in life to prepare for them with the necessary high school courses and the basic high school diploma which becomes a prerequisite to enter the training program for such better jobs and if our negro youth did take what courses were available to him and did get his high school diploma the slum school is too often our least effective educational institution especially at the secondary level its problems are greater but its staff and its budget are usually less its students need more special counseling and motivation than the college preparatory student but they usually receive less than those who by home background and teacher inspiration are already motivated the inequality of their total preparation for the job market is enormous if this is true for the northern city slum school how much more is it true for the many segregated and lowstandard schools of the south the south alone does not pay for its neglect youngsters from these southern schools come north looking for work fepcs are too limited to be of much help to this mushrooming group of unprepared unemployed young people fepc in good faith gives them a key to the world of work but the door has a double lock and the other key is education the basic economic problems of america will keep a substantial number of americans out of work regardless of race or religion until programs are developed to meet the problems which automation brings as things stand now however americans who also belong to one of our racial minorities do make up and will make up a disproportionately large share of these unemployed approaches to equality it would now seem necessary to develop some more affirmative approaches to the problem of equal employment opportunity it would now seem necessary to move from a neutral emphasis on eliminating discrimination at the point of hiring to an emphasis on programs which will selfconsciously place more minority workers in more and better jobs the civil_rights slogan of merit employment cannot be allowed to become a selfimposed limitation on efforts to achieve equality in employment some of the approaches of the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity do seem geared to accomplish this purpose the requirement of annual progress reports from firms employing fifteen and a half million workers does not merely ask these employers to show compliance with the antidiscrimination clause in their government contract it also asks for a report on what positive progress has been made the plans for progress which are voluntary agreements with about thirty of the nations largest government contractors go even further the rca plan for example lists under plans for continuing affirmative action added emphasis to existing programs for the purpose of seeking out greater numbers of qualified negro and other minority group applicants through a concerted effort during hiring campaigns the objective is to increase such groups representation in occupations at the higher skill levels directives to employment and personnel managers at all locations to increase their contacts with negro organizations and other agencies in the development of qualified candidates for job referrals a general program of guidance and encouragement to be made available to negroes and other minority group employees to stimulate upgrading training and transfer potential within their occupational specialty training managers at each location to arrange periodic sessions with individual employees or with groups of interested employees a positive program of action to be undertaken for the appraisal and counseling of negro and other minority group employees who appear to have potential for advancement into supervisory and management positions the emphasis of the presidents committee is not on single cases of discrimination as it is with most fepc work but on the overall affirmative goal of employing more minority people the federal government can make other important contributions for example it is not enough to prohibit discrimination in the apprenticeship programs which receive government assistance it is important to take steps to provide for more apprenticeship training programs and more opportunities for the employment of apprentices equal opportunity is important but at the present time it is scarcity of apprenticeships which is being shared in california alone for example collective bargaining agreements are said to provide for about apprentices but employers are willing to employ only about this year of these over are in the carpenters program so the opportunities in all the remaining programs are very limited indeed it would help if the government would stipulate that every federal contract must have joint labormanagement apprenticeship training programs good vocational guidance programs are now administered by some state departments of employment these are especially helpful to young people this resource is not sufficiently used by minority people the federal government through its possible control over these state departments could make effective job counseling a service available in all states and to all people it could coordinate this counseling service with the training programs for national manpower needs for which the federal government must take increasing responsibility it is also necessary for government employment which is constantly expanding to develop a more conscious overall pattern of equal opportunity there is now substantial minority employment in government jobs but it varies from area to area from department to department and from job level to job level often depending on the prejudices of the local hiring officer here too it is necessary to go further back than the point of hiring for in some areas according to the united states civil_rights commission no negroes applied for the necessary civil service examinations perhaps while most of the schools in the south are still segregated the negro schools can play a special role making sure that their students are informed of possible civil service examinations and their requirementsand the fact that the federal government may not discriminate in employment at least not without violating a presidential order in short it is now urgent to recognize that the active measure of success for equal employment opportunity is not just the low number of discriminatory practices but the high number of minority people who are actually being hired the social remedy lies in a range of positive steps from improving the existing fep laws and practices to special training and recruiting programs to perhaps a drastic retooling of public school programs fep laws are an indispensable first step towards the achievement of equal job opportunity but even at best only a first step im sick of by horton floyd m sick soul i and tired of yes i am i say this knowing fuu weh that i will draw upon myself all the wrath and venom of a whole multitude of soulshouting chauvinists more intent on terror than on truth but it is about time that someone punctured the big balloon of budding black supremacy and it might just as well be me first let it be clearly understood that ilike most fairminded clearthinking americans negro and whitefully understand the emotions which drive so many negroes to seize what they consider a racial virtue and to attempt to raise it to the level of a unique and exclusive badge of superiority the racist practices which degrade and dehumanize negroes in this country deserve the worst possible opprobium it is madness but must negroes ape this madness if madness is to be fought with madness then what is to happen to sanity one of the legacies left by our negro ancestors was an enduring sense of simplicity and saneness must we abandon our heritage in the act of defending it in a brilliant article in a recent issue of the progressive magazine columnist murray kempton wrote we all americans owe to unknown southern negroes whatever has been epic in the history of the united states for the past ten years cooks and maids poor isole farmers students in colleges that hardly have libraries have become authors of that history kempton is a white man one who understands how racism can drive people to depths of depravity on the one hand and to great heights of nobility on the other hand and he knows which hand will hold the victory they will win who cling to honesty and truth and a vision unclouded by hate and revengehowever meritedand to the promise always inherent in the idea of freedom and dignity but the fanatical adherents of the cult of soul do not seem to understand this they are playing the enemys game by isolating what they believe to be a superior negro characteristic they are merely giving credence to the racists dogma they have swallowed the propaganda of racial superiority and are trying to twist it around to serve their own undernourished egos to begin with just what is this thing called soul stripped of emotion it seems to stand as that quality of negroness resulting from the fact of racial oppression and denial physiognomy aside negroes differ from whites in america in proportion to the degree of variance of their life experiences the american culture is a manyfaceted thing andcontrary to the preachings of the silly southernersthe pattern of life devised by negroes in an effort to overcome the obstacles strewn in their path is one of the central elements of the complex whole this negro subculture as the sociologists call it infused as it is with hurt and anger and anguish and love is the fertile womb of the concept called soul as expressed in muthe calm indomitable elegance of marian anderson the cool hard determination of james h meredith these are the qualities bred by suffering and denial and the strong unbreakable faith in human dignitywhich is a strong unbreakable faith in self but the negro is merely expressing in his own very special way the same qualities of character and perseverance which other races and sicwhich seems to be the principal medium through which it is expoundedsoul is the sorrow and pain and joythe tonal sum total of the negro experience it is the salty blues of dinah washington the wailing laments of ray charles and the sweet bitter soaringly melancholy notes from the horn of miles davis and it is more it also is the lilting searching imageshattering prose of james baldwin the loping insinuating panthery grace of sidney poitier other peoples express in their different ways the soul cultists would have the world believe that those characteristics bred by the negro experience are ipso facto superior this is pure nonsense the negro does indeed stand at this moment in historyin a morally privileged position but this is a gift chiefly given him by the folly and failure of white people in the pursuit of their vaunted principles by practicing rampant racism in the face of all the noble declarations about freedom and democracy white people have surrendered their right to identification with these precepts negroes can yet lay claim to these principles for circumstances have not provided negroes the opportunity of betraying them not yet that is but the black chauvinists are certainly doing their part to throw away whatever moral advantage the same logic apply in other areas to other art formsto opera for instance since opera is the creation of white people developed out of their experiences it therefore follows that no negro can sing it with appropriate feeling leontyne price then can never hope to equal the performance of renata tebaldi in interpreting the music of the italian composer verdi on the operatic stage and grace bumbry negroes may have in this ugly racial rivalry take the question of jazz for example in recent months a great wave of militancy has swept over certain negro jazz musicians and jazz lovers jazz they declare fire in eyes is a negro creation born of the travail and heartache and primeval memory of the race and therefore no white man can feel it and play it with the proper amount of soul well okay for the sake of argument assume this is so would who had the singular honor of singing the german wagners music at the great bayreuth festival should have accepted beforehand that she could never match elizabeth schwarzkopf as venus absurd worse plain silly leontyne price and grace bumbryand a whole handful of superlative negro singersare extraordinary vocal artists capable of performing operatic roles on a par with their white peers the fact of race is just inconsequential and white vocalists like barbara dane and anita oday can sing rings around a whole host of runofthemill negro blues singers and will match some of the best can diahann carroll sing the blues better than peggy lee because diahann is a negro and peggy is white well the answer to that is obvious diahann is a singer of sweet and sophisticated songs and she brings such an exquisite quality to them that the great richard rodgers who is white wrote a musical for her on the other hand peggy latches onto a barrelhouse number as if she came from rough and ready lower basin street rather than the placid plains of jamestown north dakota when it is a matter of style with these two lovely ladies race is irrelevant i want to make it perfectly clear yea to even emphasizethat i am not saying that negroes do not bring a certain indigenous quality to the blues that they do is selfevident but by the same token it is not true that only negroes can sing the blues any more than it is true that only whites can sing romantic balladsor opera american negroes have much to be proud of no group of people in this countryand few in any countryhave had to struggle as long and as hard against such strong and unrelenting forces in order to enjoy a measure of freedom the battle has been fought with great valor and with even greater dignity and the american culture has been glorified and enriched by the negros uncommon faith and perseverance but as splendid as the negros fight has been it has not been really unique considered in the vast context and panorama of history courage and determination are traits that belong to the human race not merely to the negro race nothing could be more selfdefeating than the idea that negroes share some superior natural virtue alien to the rest of mankind this is rabid racism no matter what other name it assumes and that is why i am sick and tired of hearing all this boastful talk about soul soul is merely an esotericsounding concept disguising the ugliness of racisminreverse and i want no part of it neither now nor ever commenting upon the contents of this volume the authors wrote in the picture of life in that emerges from these chapters is a candidcamera shot of the community in the final stages of the depression and in the midst of the second world war depression and war have passed peace and prosperity prevail the reader will no doubt want to know to what extent has the community changed during the past years bronzeville as a compact and selfconscious community still exists there has been very little change in the fundamental values of its people or in the basic social structure and cultural patterns of the community if we compare the content of the chicago defender as described in black metropolis for instance with that in the worlds greatest weekly of today we find that the basic themes and orientations persist although details have changed church and club news is still reported in elaborate detail and race heroes and race leaders are still big news although joe louis has been replaced by rafer johnson and archie moore and haile selassie by the new african leaders stories about martin_luther_king now compete for space with those about oldline politicians and race leaders and there is an increasing number of firsts and a diminishing number of onlies even a cursory tour of bronzeville will reveal that the measure of the man remains the same and that much of life still revolves around those axes of life originally selected for discussion staying alive getting ahead having fun praising god and advancing the race the changes which have occurred are related primarily to two crucial facts of the s namely that america is experiencing a period of prosperity and that negroes are living in the era of integration by the lean years had gone just staying alive had ceased to be the problem for most people negroes were beginning to sing happy days are here again instead of moaning ive been down so long down dont bother me by money had been circulating freely and rapidly for over a decade credit had been made easy through budget plans and wage assignments and in it was even possible to find an ad like this in the negro press everyone rides we guarantee you a car even if youve had a repossession garnishee or judgment no comakers needed fine clothes new furniture and household gadgets ubiquitous tv and radio sets as well as a plethora of cars give visible evidence of bronzevilles participation in the abundance of the affluent society the negro population of chicago doubled between and bronzevilles doctors dentists lawyers preachers and businessmen captured a sizeable share of the dollars circulating in the expanded and to some extent captive black belt market their offices churches and homes reflect the new prosperity as do newspaper notices of frequent continental and occasional intercontinental travels and the elaboration of social rituals the addition of new neighborhoods to the black belt has increased the number of negro aldermen in city hall and has resulted in more precinct captains ward officials and jobs for the boys as well as symbolic appointments to high office the business center of bronzeville has shifted two miles southward as the community has grown in sizefrom th street to rd street negro entrepreneurs have opened up numerous new restaurants taverns liquor stores hotels barber shops and beauty parlors some negroes have also made a killing in real estate negro cab owners have not only expanded their illegal but protected business of running jitney cabs on bronzevilles main thoroughfares but they have also won the fight to operate their metered cabs throughout the city negro insurance companies have held their own and some have prospered greatly although they are still pygmies beside giants like metropolitan and prudential morticians too have profited from the population increase a highly successful sausage company and a cosmetics enterprise are both selling to the broader white market but these are the exceptions which prove the rule that negro business still caters to a predominantly negro market the most spectacular business successes during the past decade have been scored in the publishing field one enterprising bronzeville publisher has nurtured his magazines ebony jet tan and negro digest to the point where they not only attract a high volume of national advertising but are also sold on newsstands throughout the country and overseas a daily defender has been in existence for almost five years to supplement the weekly chicago defender both publishers have purchased property in neardowntown chicago and moved their businesses there a bronzeville businessman has bought the pittsburgh courier and now publishes a chicago courier as well for the benefit of readers in black metropolis the new crusader has replaced dynamite as a sensational race conscious agitational organ carrying the slogan negroes must control their own community the preachers have taken full advantage of the fat years to pay off mortgages and to build new churches and remodel old ones attractive modernistic edifices have sprung up and several church community centers planned and dreamed of during the depression years have now materialized also as in the past negro congregations have been buying the churches and synagogues abandoned by white congregations as they retreat in the face of negro settlement in new neighborhoods what was once bronzevilles most spectacular negro business policyhas been taken over by the mob policy shops no longer operate openly as negro businesses the jones brothers the gentlemen racketeeers who were described as race heroes in the first edition of black metropolis have now gone into legitimate business in mexico city they fled chicago after one of them was kidnapped by white racketeers and held for ransom the front man whom they left to look after their business in chicago was eventually gunned down on a street in bronzeville thus making the takeover of the once black syndicate complete while some successful negro policy operators still remain they are really only small fry and none of them exhibit social pretensions the policy racket lost its functional utility when prosperity came to bronzeville and its glamor when it ceased to be a negro controlled business few race leaders feel called upon to defend it now as they did during the depression change is most immediately evident in the physical setting within which community activities take place the black belt has grown enormously in size and thousands of negroes are now living in fine apartment buildings and in relatively new attractive homes vacated during the last ten years by white people who were getting ahead and who symbolized the fact by increasing the physical distance between themselves and negroes with money in the bank and gi and fha loans available bronzevilles home owners have been lavishing attention upon their newly acquired properties partly because of intrinsic satisfaction in so doing pride of possession and aso because it is part of the ritual of advancing the race they feel impelled to stamp out the stereotype that negroes always run neighborhoods down even the older parts of the black belt have a new look extensive slumclearance and rebuilding have changed the face of the black belts northern section while elbow grease paint and grass storm windows and flowers have eliminated much of the drab rundown depression look of yesteryears but unkempt neighborhoods and litterladen alleys and streets have by no means disappeared and bronzevilles masses are still piled up on top of each other in cramped quarters to a greater extent than in any other part of midwest metropolis to them the black ghetto has become a gilded ghetto but a ghetto all the same the economic and ecological changes have inevitably affected what was referred to as the system of social classes in bronzeville although the basic pattern ville although the basic pattern has not been altered the departure of the gentlemen racketeers from the city and the tendency of members of what was described as the upper shady group to concentrate their investments in legitimate enterprises has been accompanied by the disappearance of an upperclass sector that was important during the depression years it might now be more accurate to define a center of orientation at the upperclass level called the unconventional uppers or the sporting set and to drop the term upper shadies the style of life of the upper respectables or the conventional uppers has not changed it has simply become more elaborate the same exclusive male clubs originally described in black metropolis set the tone of upperclass social life but the civic activity and social ritual of the upperclass and the activities of the greek letter fraternities and sororities are now functioning to weld together a new and larger upperclass stratum based upon a core of younger college graduates recruited from all social levelsthose who have made money during the period of prosperity and who want to live the upperclass style of fife not all of the successful professional men strive to become upperclass however some settle for a less expansive uppermiddleclass existence the upper and uppermiddle strata continue to supply leadership for the national association for the advancement of colored people the urban league the ymca the ywca provident hospital and a wide range of other civic organizations in bronzeville members of these strata too are beginning to appear in greater numbers upon the citywide boards of charitable and civic organizations thus linking bronzeville to influential sectors of the white community through membership in a variety of interracial organizations upon whose boards they serve at whose meetings they frequently speak and with whose members they now sustain to an increasing extent more intimate social participation but the major professional organizations do not yet welcome their negro counterparts as members and parallel structures to those organizations still exist in bronzeville the members of the upper stratum also continue to link bronzevilles elite to the negro elite in cities throughout the country by membership in national negro organizations and clubs and by frequent intervisiting the black proletariat divided into middleclass and lowerclass segments and sharing the fruits of the period of prosperity is even less inclined than in the past to think of itself as a part of some interracial workingclass in the marxian senseexcept during an occasional strike many of its members who however like their white counterparts belong to unions by checkoff if not by choice middleclass status now as in the past demands respectable public behavior relatively conventional family life and some concern for getting ahead the fact that recent migrants from the south are better educated than those of the past has probably augmented the size of bronzevilles middle class the world of the lower class is no longer neatly patterned in a physical sense as it was sixteen years ago slum clearance and urban redevelopment programs have wiped out the concentrated cluster of lowerclass institutions and scattered the population but as a subculture the world of the lower class still exists storefront churches flourish but illiterate and semiliterate individuals who feel that they are called to preach find it increasingly difficult to rent stores since rundown business streets are being eliminated by slum clearance and lowcost housing projects make no provision for such spiritual entrepreneurs there has been a substantial increase however in the number of conventional churches catering to lowerclass religious tastes the two large churches which were popular in these religious circles when black metropolis first appeared are still in existence but elder lucy is dead and when she passed her body was paraded through bronzevilles streets in state with coach and horses new churches appealing to recent immigrants from the south are now far more popular than either of these two churches still constitute a center of stability amid the constant flux and disorder of the world of the lower class bronzevilles upper class continues to worry about the negro image created among outsiders by lower class activities but they have had to resign themselves to what they consider the loud and unrepresentative radio programs for which the lower status churches easily find sponsors they are particularly concerned over the high degree of social disorganization which persists at the lowerclass level for the slicks the mr bens the baby chiles and their circle of associates are still prevalent how prevalent we really do not know but because their plight is so dramatic and their activities so unconventional they receive continuous publicity and thus help to fix an image in the popular mind within the disorganized segment of the lower class are the highly publicized unwed and deserted mothers some of whom draw a regular income from welfare sources as well as the women and men who have formed loose and shifting commonlaw alliances the recalcitrant and sometimes violent school children the teenage gangsters the dope users and pushers and the small hard core of habitual criminals urban renewal tends to make the entire city more aware of bronzevilles lumpenproletariat for as the slums are cleared and the physical locus of the lower class is shattered individuals and families are forced to scatter into middleclass neighborhoods and onto the margins of these areas since public relocation housing has never kept pace with demolition enterprising realtors in middleclass neighborhoods are always ready to convert houses and apartment buildings in order to accommodate new tenants in crowded discomfort while the most marginal families huddle in dilapidated buildings awaiting demolition within clearance areas an occasional tragedy as when a firetrap burns or a baby is bitten by a rat excites a spate of excited newspaper comment and sometimes an expose the urban league refers to members of this group as chicagos dps bigger thomases as richard wright described them in native son keep on being bred and the frying pan is still useful against the rodents most of the people in midwest metropolis are now aware that all negroes are not that way but many people negro and white feel that too many of them are the middle classes insist upon increased police protection but realize that arrest and punishment solve no problems there is a general feeling that all social work efforts are merely holding operations until complete job equality and adequate housing provide a new physical and economic framework of existence and new incentives for young people out of which it is hoped new patterns of behavior will grow the lowerclass churches do not speak of the condition of the disorganized masses and very few brands are snatched from the burning despite continuous praying and singing preaching and revivals in recent years new black gods of the metropolis have appeared the leader and teacher the honorable elijah muhammad who was taught by the god whose proper name is allah has bought a synagogue near the university of chicago and converted it into mr muhammads temple no with its affiliated university of islam here and through his newspaper and over the radio he exhorts the socalled negroes to repudiate the white mans religion to cast off the names inherited from slavery to eschew pork drinking smoking and gambling and to help build a nation in this wilderness of north america he encourages his followers to go into business but the attempts of the muslims to erect a business center in a new negro middleclass neighborhood created such vigorous opposition that the venture was blocked the moors were operating in chicago as early as the s but it is only since the second world war that black muslims have attracted a substantial following the female faithful in their colorful pseudoarabic gowns and the fanatical males including the judotrained fruit of islam can fill the chicago stadium at nationwide conventions of the black muslims but the number of people in bronzeville who have actually joined the movement would hardly fill the auditoriums of the two largest baptist churches the rise of the black muslims is one index to the deep resentment among lowerclass negroes but is no more likely to have a significant impact upon bronzeville than did the communist party during the depression years neither the christian churches nor mr muhammad are able to influence that large segment of the lowerclass whose resentment is expressed in apathy cynicism and aggression and whose primary mode of escape is through having a good time it is the hope of most middleclass social workers and educators that as increasing numbers of migrants find regular employment as they settle inand as the educational level of bronzevilles population rises more and more people will adopt the middleclass way of life in addition to conventional family patterns this would involve widespread acceptance of church oriented and society oriented behavior the middleclass way of life thus takes on a degree of significance which justifies detailed consideration by sociologists it represents a realistic goal toward which younger people in the lowerclass can aspire it provides patterns which can be acquired without a great deal of selfdenial and with only a moderate amount of schooling a regular income is the main prerequisite it is a pattern which is attractive to the masses and which can motivate people to strive for it judged by intellectual standards it represents devotion to trivia judged by functional standards it provides stability amidst disorder consensus instead of anomie middleclass society is very much as it was sixteen years ago the same clubs which set the pattern when black metropolis was originally written are still going strong the kool kustomers dances are even more elaborate in this era of integration and they are sometimes held in loop hotels but scores of new clubs have also come into being some of them perhaps more popular than the amethyst girls and the kool kustomers the emergence of new clubs is sometimes mentioned in defender club notes in such announcements as a capacity crowd frolicked with the dapper dans when the clubs marked its first anniversary in clubdoms ranks or when it was stated that the contessas were busily preparing for their debut in a first annual dance fashion shows have become one of the most popular moneyraising activities throughout bronzeville prosperity has made possible an extreme elaboration of the cult of clothes which serves to integrate the world of society and the world of the church in upperclass and middleclass circles style shows and fashion revues are a fixture of the bronzeville subculture and no one sees anything incongruous about the guild of a catholic church sponsoring a pert and pretty fashion show or a baptist church presenting excelsiors in fashion review at its thirtythird anniversary services at the center of the cult of clothes is a group of amateur and professional models male and female some of whom are graduates of or students at charm and model schools the pace is still set by the group of women referred to in black metropolis as being the fashion setters sixteen years ago along with their younger admirers these women have connections with downtown department stores and some of them occasionally travel to paris in order to familiarize themselves with the latest styles these models move about bronzeville continually appearing at events sponsored by clubs and churches or giving their own revues despite the conspicuous consumption characteristic of bronzevilles people during the past decade considerable anxiety and apprehension exist beneath the surface for the bubble could burst as it once did in also despite gains in living space the middle classes still have the problems posed by lorraine hansberry in her play a raisin in the sun uneasiness exists also over certain dilemmas presented by the era of integration all race leaders must express full commitment to the ultimate goal of complete and total integration but they find themselves involved in contradictions which result in inconsistencies of attitude and behavior there are problems and questions such as the following bronzevilles political power is based upon the existence of a segregated community what kind of political influence and rewards could negroes hope to expect if the black belt were to disappear some middleclass negroes are living in integrated communities the pressure of an overcrowded black belt is likely to transform such communities into sections of the black ghetto should negroes cooperate with whites in using various devices to maintain a realistic racial balance in these neighborhoods given the fact that their fellow black citizens need more housing should they help to keep the proportion of negro residents down in such areas the prosperity of negro business and professional men rests upon the existence of a black belt could they survive under conditions of general competition if the church is desegregated will mixed congregations ever accept negro ministers are there values and cultural products which have developed among negroes that will be lost if full integration ever becomes a reality such questions do not of course have the same urgency for those whose incomes do not depend upon the existence of a negro market or a negro electorate the negro masses for instance applaud the new race heroes on the white sox and cubs teams without giving a thought to the effect of this draining away of talent from the negro baseball leagues younger people too seem to be gaining a greater sense of confidence in their ability to face competition in an integrated america bronzevilles institutions keep alive the myth of salvation via negro business but the fact remains that despite the multiplication of small capitalists and the greater affluence of some large ones negroes have not broken into the industrial and commercial big time and the bulk of the negro markers money goes to white banks and loan companies the supermarkets the downtown department stores and to white insurance companiesnot to negro enterprises occasionally integrationist trends are viewed with alarm as a threat to negro business in midapril of for instance the chicago negro chamber of commerce met to discuss how does integration affect negro business and the new crusader reported expressions of grave concern the negro masses on the whole have shown no inclination to sacrifice in order to build cooperatives nor to earmark a part of their income for supporting negro private ventures enough have shown racial loyalty however to support two very successful savings and loan companies and one cooperative store and credit union the goal of a selfcontained negro economy has always been considered a defensive measure and not an ideal solution to bronzevilles problems now some of bronzevilles capable and alert oldergeneration businessmen are talking of selling to the american market not just to the negro market and at least one is proving that it can be donehe has developed a cosmetics business which sells one line of goods to negroes and another to whites operating on a national scale his annual conventions of executives and salesmen are held at downtown chicago hotels and the defender refers not only to the lush setting but also to the fact that these conferences are an example of integration in action the competitive situation in this period of highly developed capitalism makes it very difficult for negroes to enter business with sufficient capital and enough influential contacts to ensure a successful building up of impressive manufacturing or commercial concerns most negro businessmen find it much safer to invest in real estate or businesses within the negro community than to risk their capital in businesses oriented toward the general american market in recent years too there has been increased interest within the negro middle class in conventional stocks and bonds investments grumbling about jim crow is still one of bronzevilles major indoor sports taking the white man apart remains a routine conversational activity but fulltime fighting against discrimination and segregation is considered a specialist activitythe job for race leaders and race heroes for a certain kind of white person for job holders in the newer race relations organizations and for college kids who go freedom riding in the south or take a part in sitins and swimins in midwest metropolis everybody feels however that such people should be backed up raising money for freedom riders became a part of church ritual during the height of the movement just as campaigns for the scottsboro boys emmett tills defense fund or the montgomery bus boycotters had been in the past people also generally feel that they should contribute to the naacp and urban league even when they may not do so but for most people wearing their dark skin color is like living with a chronic disease one learns to take it and not to let it unduly cramp ones style of life and anodynes are always present religion the social ritual whiskey dopeand for those who can afford it an occasional trip to europe latin america or africa as a kind of play therapy from the black muslims point of view negroes should deliberately accept segregation they assert that negroes of all social classes are losing their selfrespect by pursuing an integrationist willothewisp the muslims continuously assail martin_luther_king the freedom riders the naacp and the urban league and call for the building of a black nation upon land to be secured from the government as compensation for back wages stolen during several centuries of slavery one member writes there are at least three things that we must do in order to lift the heel of satan ie the white man from our necks and that is to one separate our people from the caucasian race which means putting an end to integration second return the white mans religion of christianity which is the mental chain that is rusting and destroying our peoples minds and third we must come together this means dissolving our very foolish and false class system doctors professors lawyers college students mothers and fathers the young and old should take up the banner of islam and build a righteous nation on this earth most negroes reject the muslims racism and separatism while admiring their militancy and successful business enterprises during the s there has been a marked increase of interest in africa among the people of black metropolisa fascination with the rise of the new african states coupled with some resentment over the fact that special treatment is reserved for african diplomats so that they are less subject to discrimination at the upper and uppermiddleclass levels this interest is reflected in occasional parties for prominent african visitors in vacation trips to africa by the few who can afford it by investment in a few african business projects and by the frequent programming of lectures and discussions about africa before church groups and clubs at lower status levels there is considerable vicarious identification with leaders like jomo kenyatta and lumumba who symbolize violent assault upon the ramparts of white supremacy yet bronzeville rejects neogarveyism with its backtoafrica emphasis as decisively as it rejects mr muhammads nation in this wilderness identification with emergent africa while providing reinforcement for the sentiment of race pride is not diverting bronzevilles leadership from the primary goal of full integration into american life this blending of interest in the new africa with the american struggle for equality was reflected in the activities of those race leaders who in were preparing for an exposition to celebrate the centennial of the emancipation proclamation their lobbying had secured financial support from both the federal and state governments most of the exhibits were to deal with the progress of the negro in america since slavery but considerable time and money was also being expended upon preparing an attractive display of our african background and of development in modern africa life in bronzeville is interesting often exciting and always meaningfulthough usually not in terms of values richard wright would have respected or admired yet like most intellectuals he underemphasized the extent to which a serious interest in art literature music and ideas has always existed side by side with the social ritual in the upper and uppermiddle classes the system is paying off and occasionally someone hits the jackpot opportunities and money are present for having a ball when people want to the mass culture provides a very wide range of satisfactions negrosparked race riots or mass demonstrations emigration to mother africa to the soviet motherland or to mr muhammads utopia have no appeal for they do not make sense in a period of prosperity and the era of integration and the big questions such as what of the bomb are seldom asked in bronzeville negroes in bronzeville are very much americans and this means too that if the masses are driven too far they are likely to fight back despite their sometimes seemingly indifferent reactions to discrimination and segregation a potential for future violence within black metropolis exists that should not and cannot be ignored the quiet leader by bernard molohon he year marks t the anniversary of the p passing of one of the truy nee ro lead ers of this century but because he shunned publicity during a lifetime devoted to bettering the lot of his people washington wire services gave his death only passing notice by the time those dispatches were published in the hinterlands most newspapers had cut the story to one paragraph the humble man who died of a heart attack at the age of would have been very well satisfied with that because he was a government worker and those people are said to have a passion for anonymity he might have expected even less but i am one person who feels he deserved a large page one story dr ambrose caliver was the first negro ever to receive a permanent professional appointment to the united states civil service breaking this longtime insurmountable barrier alone could have tagged dr caliver for immortality among his people for his persistence not only opened those doors but helped pave the way for higher appointments of the ralph bunches and the robert weavers the latter to a full cabinet post if president kennedy had not been frustrated by a few narrow politicians however dr caliver was not satisfied merely to have broken down a colored berlin wall for years he quietly headed the negro education unit in the u s office of education working diligently to better the lot of his people in the one field which could truly make them equaland free and when he died he was chief of the adult education section of the u s office of education where he could help older people of all races who felt they had missed something in their youth or who eagerly wanted to go on learning among them he felt there was a high percentage of negroes because dr caliver wished that his many accomplishments be softpedaled he died barely known outside of american educational circles sad to relate millions of american negroes were hardly aware of his existence but his influence touched and will continue to affect the life of every negro in the united states for a long time and influence for generations many even beyond these shores i first met dr caliver shortly after world war ii had broken out in europe he was then head of the negro education unit in the u s office of education and i was starting to gather material for my book voices of democracy since the iron boot of dictatorship was daily grinding down more areas of democracy america was determined to do everything possible to see that the torch of freedom was not entirely blotted out my little job was to put together a handbook for teachers speakers and writers showing what had been said and done over the centuries to further the cause of democracy one section was to consist of memorable stories of the long fight for freedom the other of quotations on all phases of freedom what was happening to minorities in europe probably blinded my thinking when i called on dr caliver for quotes and stories on the rights of minorities especially something from negro leaders since he was best acquainted with them the tall welldressed man thought a minute and then politely asked what other subheads i would have in my book i looked at my rough notes and read off some of the things i had in mind our inalienable rights liberty defending liberty giving up liberty power suffrage criticism freedom to know freedom of expression freedom of conscience free government free homes justice equality what we read and write truth thinking as we please they were all just in the thinking stage but i felt most quotations would fall under those headings dr caliver made some notes and then told me he would have something for me in a few days he did but he personally brought it to my office rather than have his secretary call me and tell me the material was ready ive probably gone pretty far afield here and there he said rather apologetically but you can use what you want and throw out the rest for instance booker t washington spent his life trying to improve the mind of the negro but to my way of thinking one of his most memorable remarks was that no man should be ashamed to use his hands he stood in front of my desk as i glanced over the sheets he had handed me besides the pointed remark by booker t washington that the black man who cannot let love and sympathy go out to the white man is only half free and vice versa he included statements by such negro leaders as charles s johnson james weldon johnson william pickins and charles harris wesleyall caliver contemporaries but there was nothing by dr ambrose caliver when i reminded him of this he modestly said he had nothing worthy of being included after dr caliver left i realized that he had not confined himself to quotations by negro leaders on the narrow subject of minorities i remembered that i had suggested just that but without making a point of it dr caliver had included statements by negro leaders which would fit many other categories i could as he reminded me use them or not as i saw fit i wondered why i had been so warped my only excuse was that the pathetic state of minorities in europe screamed at me every day from the front pages of our newspapers certainly negroes had said things about other phases of freedom and liberty dr caliver also gave me leads to such stories as how john quincy adams broke the gag rule in the house of representatives with petitions signed by slaves and how james madison living in a slave state showed how he detested slaverywelcome additions to a section of the book carrying capsule stories of democracy another thing bothered me after dr caliver left my office he had stood courteously at my desk while i overcome by the windfall of material he had brought me had been too absorbed or too impolite to ask him to sit down i mentioned this at lunch to a fellowworker in the office of education who had known dr caliver for a long time i know i should have invited him to sit down but wouldnt you think he would have anyway i asked no not dr caliver said my friend not until he gets to know you better for all he knows now you might be one of those birds who thinks hes superior to a negro so you were making him stand there on purpose what i was too surprised to say more sure and he wouldnt fight about it if you were one of those guys after all as long as he knows youre not any better than he is nothing else matters but a big guy like that by big i meant that dr caliver with his string of college degrees really was a big man in educational circles in later months we had a good laugh together when i told him he was several degrees smarter than was since i had missed getting my ba by three days but my friend thought i was referring to the fact that dr caliver was physically larger than i was well while he was standing there he was looking down on you wasnt he later when i got to know dr caliver better and found how easy it was to talk over such problems objectively i had it driven home again that trifles never bother a real big man no matter what his race the overall job of bettering the educational plight of the american negro was such a big undertaking that dr caliver could not waste time jousting with puny windmills human or material and today when a dr ralph bunche says i both scorn and pity white bigots but i despise those who are black i can see that the influence of dr caliver has seeped down to the next generation just as dr caliver learned from his great hero booker t washington that love and sympathy are twoway streets knowing dr caliver better also gave me a new insight into his thinking and explained many of his actions i found that he in reaching his high state in civil service met with many problems similar to those encountered by benjamin o davis sr in becoming the first negro in u s history to receive a generals star but neither man seemed to resent the fact that to get such an appointment he probably had to be just a little better than the white man who attained the same grade instead both men appeared to welcome the gauntlet thrown down for them and were proud to pick it up in the end of course both confounded critics of the appointments however at times in dr calivers career he felt as if he had run into a brick wall but instead of resenting it or getting violent about it he merely marked it down as experience refused to make the same mistake again backed up and made what he called an endrun around the wall he was quite adamant about violence im sure he was not a a pacifist but his attitude was that every time an agitator stirred negroes to violence they lost ground that had been gained by peaceful means and at the same time lost many potential friends he preferred to knock down enemies in a far more lasting and devastating manner somewhat in the way the man who was to become the catholic churchs first negro cardinal did a free north new jersey barber who refused to let him in his chair with a shrug and the remark its all right prayed for the man as dr caliver regarded such incidents the barber could quickly repair a broken window or even heal a split lip but he could never wipe out the scar left by such a perfect squelch and speaking of resentment i once asked dr caliver if it wasnt an affront to his race that a big part of the u s office of education was set aside as a negro unit when education in this country should be free and equal no i dont resent the idea at all negroes have special problems at least at this stage of the game and those problems can best be handled by people of their own race time will gravitate this unit out of existence of course but if the whites had learned that lesson early in their handling of the american indian maybe they wouldnt have had so much violence in finally settling the indian problem that made sense to me a pacific northwest native who had been reared a mile from an indian reservation dont you get discouraged with the slowness of negro educational progress in this country i asked him not at all we havent done so badly in the few generations since the american negro was freed from slavery would you like to see some charts on how weve progressed from practically one hundred percent illiteracy in just a few short years i mean when compared to what the white man did in hundreds of years after he came to americaa free man i got the point however dr caliver went on there is just one thing a good many negroes havent learned yet from those white men even the ones who couldnt write their names many of those people came from countries where their station in life had been set for generations they came to america to get out of those ruts especially as they moved west one of the first things those illiterate pioneers did was build schools for their youngsters they were not too illiterate to realize that there would be jobs opening up in america for which their children couldnt qualify unless they were educated and they put forth a good deal of money and effort to solve their own educational problems i do not go along with any negro who spurns education because he thinks it is fruitless to prepare for a better job in america that was about as violent a remark as i ever heard from the lips of the man who in his humble way was trying to lead his race to a better life i am sure dr ambrose caliver would have been a success in any line of endeavor he chose with his unaffected dignity i often thought what a great doctor of medicine he could have become and how much money he could have made in that profession but he chose to get his doctorate in another field and to devote his life to helping all his people improve their lotat great personal and financial sacrifice to himself that is the mark of a true humanitarian and america lost one it could ill afford to lose when dr ambrose caliver died the negros escape from freedom by dr nathan hare recent years of study and observation of fellow negroes from coast to coast in america have made me ever aware of a strange paradox this is the unfortunate fact that the negro in our time is tenaciously engaged in a frantic escape from freedom the manner in which he makes his escape is somewhat curious and subtleif not sneakyyet unapparent to most owing in part to the complex sources from which it sprang indeed it has been a shocking study to me to analyze the motives for this pathetic situation i first became aware of it some years ago as i listened to the overworked cliche responses made to the question of negro disunity apathy and the appalling sense of defeatism that is the plague of so many of them i noted that they invariably fell back on some convenient rationalization minimizing their own responsibility and group worth such as well you know we originated along the nile across from the euphrates before the dawn of civilization and the white europeans came and you know we were slaves for several centuries and you just cant expect etc it was not long before i came to realize that in spite of the fact that the negros past experiences and enduring white abuse have inflicted formidable burdens on him negro intellectuals in their noble efforts to explain away and apologize for his current failures actually have contributed to the negros sense of defeatism and helplessness the resulting tendency is to refrain from what is thought to be futile action on his part as an individual this not only affects the negros conduct in the area of whitenegro relations in a number of amusing and interesting waysmore about that laterbut has tended as well to make him curiously more conservative in some respects than whites increasingly he has grown unwilling to differ from the general herdparticularly the white one thus he voluntarily enslaves himself without question or opposition to the white norms and standards which eric fromm the world famous psychoanalyst has diagnosed as representing collective neuroses let us take up these matters one by one to indicate specific ways in which the negro manages to escape from freedom while at the same time crying out that it is only being denied him it is apparent to begin with that the custom of apologizing for the negro has four main effects increasingly allows the negro to give up his fate to the whims of the white world magnifies the sense of white power and superiority minimizes the negros own sense of responsibility for doing something about his situation himself including the forcing of white hands and all of the foregoing contribute to the destruction of the negros selfrespect in both the individual and the collective sense undermine his selfsufficiency and destroy his general feeling of togetherness indeed a princeton university psychologist bertram p karon recently made an intensive study of the negro personality in which he concluded that some negroes now inwardly think of themselves and other negroes as just about as worthless as feces thus too many of them especially the middle class which should be setting a worthwhile model and contributing sound leadership merely overidentify with the white world then frantically struggle to ape the same and to escape all traces of their negro identity see the black anglo saxons negro digest may many seem pathetically unaware of the fact that they will always be coloredand never white once i conducted a survey of negro college juniors and seniors in which a question asked was discuss the negros situation as you imagine it will be by just years from now mind you but i was amazed to note how many thought that the negro race will then be invisible or indistinguishable owing to the process of miscegenation thus these young leaders of tomorrow along with their highclass parents and peers flee desperately from their responsibility to the negro race and overconform to the trivialities of the white middle class yet being without recognition and true equality they experience a gnawing feeling of being left out of things and consequently pant after the signs and symbols of acceptance and participation too often excluded they affirm that they are not going to miss a thing and seldom do yet continue to feel that too much of the life they covet is passing them by many are the frenzied hours spent on spacious lawns and redecorated patios at getacquainted parties and gettogethers some take trips as far away as cairo egypt to get included in the act while touring abroad they frequently are able to feel like a foreigner that is a nonnegro before jetting in to their waiting jobs those unable to take such trips even on paylater plans will sponsor make believe cruises in which they pretend to stop at such points as paris hawaii or sydney australia but almost never drop their imaginary anchors in a country inhabited by negroes or black folk at home again in the united states they frequently boast that they find more in common with whites even foreigners than with members of their own race and yet they are tormented by daily reminders of conscious differences this leads among other things to a sustained clamor for invitations to gatherings thrown by bored whites who use them in their quests for the thrill of the exotic and the forbidden and to satisfy their curiosity about the negro race to offset any feeling of similarity to lower class negroes on the other hand they label highclass residential sections for negroes gold coasts even though the nearest body of water may be miles away across town in integrated neighborhoods they may feel more perturbed than whites when they look up and see other negroes moving in in their group activities they constantly collect monies to rent swank ballrooms in downtown white hotels and night clubs in the effort to intensify their feeling of apartness from lower class negroes via scented invitations to formal balls and closed banquets there they proudly devour five course meals and boast that everyone was dressed for dinner after affairs not specifically devoted to eating are over the guests typically are feted at brunches sunday mornings after allnight drinking bouts and general barrelhousing then rush off at full speed and in solemnfaced piety to the front pews of their citys most elaborate church houses to show that all of the foregoing and especially the descriptions of negro behavior to follow represent an escape from freedom on their part let us first consider the validity of our general perspective this briefly is that man while influenced by things external to himself is not a slave to his circumstances past or present where lower animals rely on instinct and the nature of the habitat man is capable of resorting to strategy and reasonthough many do not indeed mans scientific name homo sapiens is translated thinking man although scientists also toyed with then discarded the label homo loguens or talking man which admittedly characterizes the majority of negro leaders but in a fundamental sense man is distinguished from other animals by his ability to think which is in the ideal sense an important aspect of talkingand is capable of choosing between two or more ideas or alternatives rejecting one or both history let alone the biographies of individuals is a testimony to mans ability to rise above the surface of his circumstances suggesting that whenever he does not he at least in part has himself to blame for man is able to cool deserts create warmth in icelands find water beneath the earth and fire and electricity in the clouds even if it could be said that the individual is one hundred per cent controlled by his circumstances it would be difficult to prove that the negro should be so more than others how long then can we continue to rationalize the negros escape from freedom and his all too frequent lack of gall yet this very thing continues at an accelerated speed with no promise of a letup indeed the pursuit of integration itself which began as a promising means to an end has contributed to this tendency in becoming an end in itself whereas other minority groups will insist on the right of their group to exist on an equal plane as distinct categories the negro prefers to liquidate the negro altogether as fast as possible thus integration is equated with acceptance by whites and mistakenly made synonymous with legal and objective equality the socioeconomic elevation of the negro as a group and the freedom of the individual indeed it often stands in the way of both negro uplift and ironically the achievement of the integrated goal itself the university of chicago political scientist prof james q wilson has pointed out in his book negro politics that negro voters for example are characterized by apathy and seldom take the trouble to vote even where they are not restrained this is due to a sense of futility which also is responsible professor wilson found for the inability of the naacp to draw more than a handful of negroes to its mass meetings and freedom rallies and the necessity for overtaxing whites for contributions to make up for the failure of the negro community to come up to its quota at the same time the typical negro is prone to shell out his last penny to smiling white women collectors in exchange for some paper tag or emblem to wear on his coat lapel to signify that the chesty bearer has contributed to white charity professor wilson also was at a loss to explain the tendency of negroes to regard anything run by negroes as less than worthless and thus by refusing to patronize negro concerns help make their own evaluation turn out true this tendency to flee from organizations for negroes recently reached extreme proportions it seems to me when the president of a state branch of the naacp told his congregation of state con ventioners that the organization should not be called naacp the national association for the advancement of colored people but rather should be the naaap the national association for the advancement of all people apparently we may soon see the day when colored folk will be actively advancing whites indeed this is not mere speculation when the national baptist convention the largest negro religious body met recently it voted a ten thousand dollar donation to rich roosevelt university a white institution forgetting all about the small colored colleges struggling in the south it is the considered opinions of some persons that colored folk are still too poor to show off like that another curious incident grew out of the negros efforts to gain white acceptance at all costs particularly by a conspicuous display of loyalty and similarity to the white race to the point of overconformity and superpatriotism this tendency is a point welldocumented by white behavioral scientists such as gunnar myrdal author of an american dilemma and the psychotherapists abram kardiner and lionel ovessey who wrote the classic study the mark of oppression as a matter of fact i have met negroes graduates of leading universities who argued in behalf of states rights one was even peeved because negroes are not allowed in the john birch society only recently i sat in an integrated gathering and listened to a negro gentleman proclaim that he didnt believe in all these overnight changes sometimes you end up worse off than you were before he then declared his conviction that rather we should go back to the customs we followed about two hundred years ago he seemed completely stunned when reminded that he himself would then be a slave fieldhand the negros cuperfrantic quest for sameness and social acceptance is even tightening the taboo against the negro individuals freedom to shun white company if he wants to when it is offered to him for fear of being accused of holding back integration at the same time they voluntarily submit in many cases to conditions of inferiority yet think that it is because they are forced to only i will never forget the way so many negroes in san diego california when i was there as a boy during world war ii used to slink to the back seats of buses in spite of the fact that they were free to ride anywhere years later in i watched this same behavior in virginia after segregated seating rules were lifted on buses those i talked with said that they did not want to start no trouble or something to that effect i have often grown weakkneed and nauseated to see negroes cringing up to cubbyhole takeaway windows for their orders to go in the north i have watched full grown negroes calmly defy young children with pickets to enter places simply because im not going to walk way down yonder to that other store or hunh i got a charge account in there they let me have anything i want it is not hard to see that this tendency to place individual acceptance over group elevation which is a product in part of the negro individuals low regard for his own kind his desire to liquidate it and a depreciation therefore of his own sense of responsibility to it has a braking effect on the rise of the negro race in america it will take the negro far longer to acquire true freedom if he does not halt his frantic efforts to escape from it rude awakening by terrezenia like most fourteenyearold girls approaching the perplexing but wonderful age of fifteen am a dreamer dreams are good because you can escape the ugly things in life you can escape to a paradise all your own you can escape reality for a while any way sooner or later you are captured and all of the things the ugly things you wish never existed hit you right in the face hard thats what happened to me when i was running an errand for my mother one warm sunny afternoon in new jersey as i rode along the sidewalk on my bicycle everything was peaceful and quiet like it had always been in our interracial community suddenly a car speeding down the road broke the serenity i noticed it but continued to ride my bike when the car came to a screeching halt forcing the passengersa pale white man and probably his wife son and daughter forward then the man yelled to me hey i turned in his direction still riding my bike nigger he screamed his entire face turned red an awful ugly red that i dont like to remember his words cut through me like a sharp knife i got off my bike to prevent myself from falling and stared at him in horrible disbelief saying nothing then he started up his car and continued his journey down the road that man must be crazy i thought risking his own life and everyone elses just to mock me about my brown skin momentarily i lost all faith in the caucasian race i didnt trust any of them i started to run home and tell my mother but then decided to go on to the store my two younger sisters would probably think i was chicken and i didnt want that to tell the truth i was chicken i was afraid to carry out my errand because i thought maybe he would come back and do something a lot worse than calling me a name maybe he would try to shoot me a lot of crazy thoughts ran through my head and for the first time in my life i was at a complete standstill and didnt know what to do or were the thoughts really so crazy hadnt i read in the newspapers and heard on the radio about poor unfortunate negroes in the south being shot beaten and having ks carved into their backs but this was the north it couldnt happen to me or could it i suppose these thoughts had really taken an effect on me because when a car pulled alongside the road occupied by white passengers and a man asked me very politely for directions to a nearby town i just stared at him wanting to run and wondered if the first man had really come back then i realized he hadnt because there were five people in this car and there had been only four in the other one just keep going straight for about two miles i said dont make any turns and youll run right into it thanks the driver said i made a weak smile trying to act natural before i had a chance to remount my bicycle another car stopped occupied by a man woman and two childrena boy and girl the man asked for directions to a place where he could discard some rubbish he had previously passed a place where he could do just that about two hundred yards from where i was standing i jumped onto my bike and said pointing back there and rode up the street as fast as i could i looked back to see if the man was really going to dump some rubbish when the car passed by me as it did the people smiled at me it wasnt a friendly smile it was more like an imadeafooloutofyou smile or smirk i felt sorry for the two children of the man who mocked and ridiculed me it couldnt be too pleasant living with a father that found hatred in his heart so strong im glad that my parents never taught me to hate anyone especially because of something physical that could not be helped somehow im sure this man didnt try to ridicule me because of my skin color alone it has to be something else something much deeper than that maybe its because he and other whites like him resent the great increase in negro progress after so many years of slavery after only fourteen years of life half spent in a segregated southern town in alabama and the other half spent in integrated northern communities in new jersey i really cant say that im much of an authority on the subject but i do know the difference between right and wrong ive been attending integrated classes since the third grade there have never been more than four negroes in my class for a couple of years i was the only colored student in my class at first i felt a little selfconscious and different and as if i didnt belong but the other pupils were so warmhearted and friendly that soon i felt like a member of the class i made many friends that i will never forget and the teachers were all very kind and understanding now that weve moved to los angeles i miss them very much often i think of the good times we had together on class projects and trips these students over fivesixths of them white never once called me a name relating to my race and color i invited the mayors niece along with other white and colored friends to some of my parties and we had a wonderful time we hardly ever discussed racial conflicts and problems arising in the south and i couldnt fully understand about the sitinners and freedom riders because i had not experienced what they were going through i couldnt understand why such a fuss was made over who rode in the front of the bus and who rode in the back and who ate at lunch counters and who couldnt and why colored and white children couldnt attend school together without riots and police i couldnt understand because i dont remember much of my first seven years spent in the south except that i attended a segregated school and lived in a segregated community in the beginning i resented the white man who mocked me but as i grow older this resentment turns to pity in this case he was my captor he was the one who awakened me from my dream and made me face things as they really are a letter to my nephew by james baldwin i have begun this letter five times and torn it up five times i keep seeing your face which is also the face of your father and my brother i have known both of you all your lives and have carried your daddy in my arms and on my shoulders kissed him and spanked him and watched him learn to walk i dont know if you have known anybody from that far back if you have loved anybody that long first as an infant then as a child then as a man you gain a strange perspective on time and human pain and effort other people cannot see what i see whenever i look into your fathers face for behind your fathers face as it is today are all those other faces which were his let him laugh and i see a cellar your father does not remember and a house he does not remember and i hear in his present laughter his laughter as a child let him curse and i remember his falling down the cellar steps and howling and i remember with pain his tears which my hand or your grandmothers hand so easily wiped away but no ones hand can wioe away those tears he sheds invisibly today which one hears in his laughter and in his speech and in his songs i know what the world has done to my brother and how narrowly he has survived it and i know which is much worse and this is the crime of which i accuse my country and my countrymen and for which neither i nor time nor history will ever forgive them that they have destroyed and are destroying hundreds of thousands of lives and do not know it and do not want to know it one can be indeed one must strive to becometough and philosophical concerning destruction and death for this is what most of mankind has been best at since we have heard of war remember i said most of mankind but it is not permissible that the authors of devastation should also be innocent it is the innocence which constitutes the crime now my dear namesake these innocent and well meaning people your countrymen have caused you to be born under conditions not far removed from those described for us by charles dickens in the london of more than a hundred years ago i hear the chorus of the innocents screaming no this is not true how bitter you are but i am writing this letter to you to try to tell you something about how to handle them for most of them do not yet really know that you exist i know the conditions under which you were born for i was there your countrymen were not there and havent made it yet your grandmother was also there and no one has ever accused her of being bitter i suggest that the innocent check with her she isnt hard to find your countrymen dont know that she exists either though she has been working for them all their lives well you were born here you came something like fifteen years ago and though your father and mother and grandmother looking about the streets through which they were carrying you staring at the walls into which they brought you had every reason to be heavyhearted yet they were not for here you were big james named for me you were a big baby i was not here you were to be loved to be loved baby hard at once and forever to strengthen you against the loveless world remember that i know how black it looks today for you it looked black that day too yes we were trembling we have not stopped trembling yet but if we had not loved each other none of us would have survived and now you must survive because we love you and for the sake of your children and your childrens children this innocent country set you down in a ghetto in which in fact it intended that you should perish let me spell out precisely what i mean by that for the heart of the matter is here and the crux of my dispute with my country you were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason the limits to your ambition were thus expected to be settled you were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity and in as many ways as possible that you were a worthless human being you were not expected to aspire to excellence you were expected to make peace with mediocrity wherever you have turned james in your short time on this earth you have been told where you could go and what you could do and how you could do it where you could live and whom you could marry i know your countrymen do not agree with me here and i hear them saying you exaggerate they do not know harlem and i do so do you take no ones word for anything including mine but trust your experience know whence you came if you know whence you came there is really no limit to where you can go the details and symbols of your life have been deliberately constructed to make you believe what white people say about you please try to remember that what they believe as well as what they do and cause you to endure does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear please try to be clear dear james through the storm which rages about your youthful head today about the reality which lies behind the words acceptance and integration there is no reason for you to try to become like white men and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you the really terrible thing old buddy is that you must accept them and i mean that very seriously you must accept them with love for these innocent people have no other hope they are in effect still trapped in a history which they do not understand and until they understand it they cannot be released from it they have had to believe for many years and for innumerable reasons that black men are inferior to white men many of them indeed know better but as you will discover people find it very difficult to act on what they know to act is to be committed and to be committed is to be in danger in this case the danger in the minds and hearts of most white americans is the loss of their identity try to imagine how you would feel if you woke up one morning to find the sun shivering and all the stars aflame you would be frightened because it is out of the order of nature any upheaval in the universe is terrifying because it so profoundly attacks ones sense of ones own reality well the black man has functioned in the white mans world as a fixed star as an immovable pillar and as he moves out of his place heaven and earth are shaken to their foundations you dont be afraid i said it was intended that you should perish in the ghetto perish by never being allowed to go beyond and behind the white mans definition by never being allowed to spell your proper name you have and many of us have defeated this intention and by a terrible law a terrible paradox those innocents who believed that your imprisonment made them safe are losing their grasp of reality but these men are your brothers your lost younger brothers and if the word integration means anything this is what it means that we with love shall force our brothers to see themselves as they are to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it for this is your home my friend do not be driven from it great men have done great things here and will again and we can make america what america must become it will be hard james but you come from sturdy peasant stock men who picked cotton dammed rivers built railroads and in the teeth of the most terrifying odds achieved an unassailable and monumental dignity you come from a long line of great poets some of the greatest poets since homer one of them said the very time i thought i was lost my dungeon shook and my chains fell off you know and i know that the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred years too early we cannot be free until they are free god bless you james and godspeed your uncle james revolt and revenge by john a morsell week or so after a a violent black nationalist demonstration in the united nations in february the new york times published two lengthy background articles dealing with this recurrent manifestation of negro discontent the reporters were able to identify and interview the leaders of some thirteen groups based in new york city and adhering in one way or another to racially selfassertive programs for negro americans these groups included besides the wellknown temple of islam the socalled black muslims such names as muslim brotherhood hostile to the black muslims united african nationalist movement universal african nationalist movement african nationalist pioneer movement united sons and daughters of africa liberation committee for africa cultural association for women of african heritage provisional committee for a free africa and so on solid information regarding the numbers of people involved is unobtainable the times reporters estimated that the total might be as low as in the city itself at least half of them black muslims figures on the nationwide strength of these groups are even more elusive eric lincoln has made current a figure of for the black muslims but he concedes that this guess is based on nothing that can be subjected to verification the significance of the black nationalist groups is not however simply a matter of their numbers as a matter of fact it derives in part from the very obscurity which surrounds the estimates of size as numerous observers have noted black nationalism is an extremist manifestation which rises out of deep and ancient fear and suspicion and which is nourished by contemporary frustration at the persistence of racial discrimination if even a relative handful is sufficiently impelled to active and personally satisfying participation and particularly if partial echoes of their arguments can be heard at nearly all levels of the negro community then there is some justification for thinking that the potential for espousal of black nationalist doctrines may be a good deal greater than the ascribable organizational base suggests it is important to understand that black nationalism is not a new phenomenon in organized form it reached its peak in the universal negro improvement association founded and led by marcus garvey just after world war i there may have been as many as american negroes who enrolled as members or made contributions looking toward the establishment of an african state to be populated by black american emigres although the organization and its program failed to survive it is likely that fond memories have sent at least a few of its veterans into the presentday black nationalist camp in its african fatherland aspect even garveys movement was antedated in american history the colonization movement conducted and financed largely by proslavery elements in the decades prior to the civil war was the real forerunner despite its temporary appeal to some opponents of slavery it never flourished it was doomed by the neartotal lack of interest on the part of free negroes and by the eventual ascendency of abolitionism in the allegiance of those opposed to human bondage but the colonizationists must be reckoned the originators of back to africa it is equally important to understand something of the varied strains which have entered into black nationalism sometimes in combination sometimes indirectly and to see them in relation to the sustaining forces at work today i do not attempt here to develop a systematic analysis but am perforce content with what is largely an itemization in this should be included the rebellion against the sense of personal inferiority bred of generations of inferior status and fed by the constant exclusions disabilities and humiliations characteristic of the segregated society in which the basic orientations of most negroes are formed to escape some measure of this has been the good fortune of only a few but the urge to escape it is virtually universal many seek release in what is in all logic the most direct waynamely by creating an image of racial superiority in which the bruised personality can find solace parenthetically it may be noted i that the rallying cry for todays f black nationalism is africa and the j african heritage and there is obviously an element of contemporary accident hereie the rise of new black nations in the dark continent fixing on africa as the chief symbol of negro militancy is something of a paradox it really implies acceptance of the derogatory stereotype of the american negro as submissive and dependent the passive beneficiary of a freedom bestowed upon him peri sons genuinely free of this stereotype and adequately informed as to their history might well have chosen their heroes and heroines ii from the american negros too littleknown record of slave revolts escapes resistance to captors abolitionist crusading and valiant combat by tens of thousands in the revolutionary war the war of and the civil war and they might have reflected too that africas new states won their independence not on the field of battle but by the relinquishing of sovereignty through negotiation and under the pressure of world opinion another strain of great importance in the nurture of black nationalism is the abandonment of hope that racial justice will or can be achieved in the united states through invocation of the established process of democratic government it was the belief that the negros quest for constitutional rights had no hope of success in his or the succeeding generation that led booker t washington to preach the doctrine of negro selfimprovement rather than negro rights the conviction that negroes can never expect full equality of citizenship with the white majorityindeed that no white people can sincerely advocate such equalityis basic to the creed of the black muslims and some of the other racist groups the selfimprovement doctrine has persisted and it has numerous adherents who do not by any stretch of the imagination belong in the black nationalist category it is essentially separatist nonetheless drawing upon the seemingly unquenchable appeal of an economically selfsufficient negro community owning its own businesses and industries and in the perennial phraseology of its advocates keeping the money in our own neighborhoods it rests heavily upon the assumption that once negroes as a group have acquired their proportionate share of the nations wealth they will move as a matter of course into political and social acceptance its most common overt manifestation aside from the endless spinning of schemes for the raising of millions of dollars among negroes for investment in grandiose business proposals is the buy black movement the reference here is of course to economic selfimprovement preached as a doctrine of racial salvation obviously there can be no question of the necessity for achievement by negroes in economic affairs as in other areas of life the itemization would not be complete without a passing reference to the communist partys advocacy for many years of a separate negro state as formulated in its policy of selfdetermination in the black belt although this policy was imposed upon the american party leadership during the twenties for rigid ideological reasons and was as remote as could be from any realistic evaluation it remained in the partys program until comparatively recently evidence of communist connections in any of the nationalist groups is thus far not established and some of them are explicit in their rejection of such links communists and russians are after all mostly white people but it is most unlikely that the thought of infiltration has not at least entered the minds of the party leaders besides the racial elements in black nationalist growth there are other kinds of contributing factors of most of these it can safely be said that they would constitute sources of frustration and discontent even if every kind of purely racial discrimination were wiped out tomorrow with almost no exception black nationalist activity is urban it is most vigorous in the largest cities squalid housing a narrow range of job possibilities because of poor training low family income and the cultural aridity typical of the demoralized slumshocked fringe component of the city population are a way of life from which black nationalism seems to many to promise salvation a dim view of authority particularly as embodied in the police resentment of the more fortunate in this case middleand upperclass negroes endemic dislike of landlords shopkeepers and bosses so often jews and in any case usually white all these help to fuel the fire and to focus its heat on specified targets the grievances themselves are genuine enough the police are frequently brutal other negroes are too often insensitive to the needs of the disadvantaged and exploitation is not unknown on the part of landlords shopkeepers and employers but for the very reason that these are class not racial grievances they cannot properly be top priority items in organizational programs which are committed to the struggle against racial wrongs such problems are thus not within direct reach of the organized efforts in which aggrieved negroes are accustomed to think of themselves as being actually or potentially involved on a personal basis if however these nonracial problems can be so represented as to seem part and parcel of the racial burden per se the black nationalists hope to accomplish two things first in the minds of their followers a remote impregnable complexity will be replaced by an apparently simple and direct line of attack second the established civil_rights efforts can be exploited as whipping boys for their failure to solve all the problems that happen to affect negroes in the case of the muslim groups there is finally the explicit element of religion in a fashion made familiar by the father divine movement spiritual regeneration becomes part of the arsenal and numerous claims are made of the movements achievements in reforming thieves drug addicts prostitutes and so on there is no reason to doubt that some of these claims at least are warranted in view of the tremendous egosatisfaction derived by many adherents from their muslim affiliation beyond the buy black appeal and other activities growing out of the selfimprovement philosophy little in the way of specified objec tives and their related programs s discernible for some there seems to be nothing beyond activity intended to buttress internal morale by endless review and denunciation of the spectrum of grievances all profess to be concerned with awakening american negroes to their true ethnic status and with inculcating pride in their racial origins some do what they can along this line through meetings literature and individual example and exhortation the purely cultural manifestations often include campaigning for wider or exclusive use of african themes and artifacts in decoration negro women are called upon to abandon the hairdresser and to substitute natural modes of wearing the hair in the african style or more accurately in one of the great variety of african styles a few of the groups concern themselves chiefly with activity in behalf of what they conceive to be the best interest of the african nations they seek to interpret african needs to the american public generally and to have united states diplomatic pressure exerted in behalf of the african states and in opposition to colonial rule many of them have enshrined as patron saint the late patrice lumumba who is depicted as a black hero singlehandedly opposing the imperialist machinations of the western countries and murdered conspiratorially at the behest of those nations the closest approach to formulation of an ultimate goalie one intended to be the final solution to racial discriminationis that of the black muslims they are committed to working for the cession by the united states government of a portion of the continental united states preferably on the southeastern seaboard for settlement by negroes who will establish there a nation of their own no program of any kind has ever been announced for bringing such an event to pass although on many occasions attempts have been made to obtain one from black muslim representatives at least one group it should be noted for the record has been identified with a genuinely violent program looking to the disruption of civil authority by force this is the first africa corps sometimes known as the rastafarians originating in jamaica west indies federation and with at least one unit in new york city death sentence was pronounced earlier this year on one of its leaders who had been convicted in jamaica of the murder of two british soldiers the rastafarians however are a lone exception to the rule of professions of peaceful intent by black nationalist groups some observers have inferred an ultimate black muslim commitment to violence on the theory that they must know that peaceful requests cannot acquire for them their black slice of united states territory it scarcely seems necessary however to insist that the black muslims face up to the logical consequences of their propaganda premises they are surely not unique in their readiness to employ arguments of great emotional appeal without regard to where implementation of the arguments should logically lead southern segregationists are an eminent case in point indeed much else of what we see in the world today suggests that our age is strangely characterized by the potent allure of calls to action actionalmost any action and to intense personal commitmentalmost any commitment so long as they are intense and personal and fill the individual with a sense of purposeful involvement the need for escape from the hard work of seeking out and studying the facts which only leads to the even harder task of serious thinking and planning has made the emotional jag highly alluring to thousands and tens of thousands of peoplein this country and elsewhere for example this partly explains the massive appeal of the radical right with its substitution of nameless and ubiquitous conspiracies to fluoridate our water and poison us to promote mental health and brainwash us to lead us hypnotized down the road from free inquiry to communism for evaluation and acceptance of the realities of our national position and of the rigorous programs needed to sustain it certain special responsibilities are obviously imposed upon all of us who are in the fight for racial justice and who want it conducted with intelligence and effectiveness as well as with passion we must face the fact that logic to the contrary notwithstanding sizeable segments of the community will continue to heed the call of false prophets and with properly disturbing implications we should anticipate the strong possibility that the followers of black nationalist messiahs may become explosively frustrated when they discover that what they have bought is not hope but illusion if we understand the need not only for making such diagnoses but for performing the necessary prophylactic and restorative functions we must of course go farther at the very minimum we must never cease to be possessed by a level of moral resentment and indignation at least as high as that of the misled victims an indignation directed not so much at the false prophets as at the conditions which permit them to flourish failing in this we will not deserve and cannot arouse the confidence and respect on which our chances of being helpful rest among other things this means that we should be as deeply moved by a restricted apartment or a racial job denial or a segregationstunted mind as we are by a freedom rideand that we should see to it that others achieve the same comprehension the fact is that there are hardly any priorities the evils we face are all of a piece and we have no choice but to take them on collectively and we have very little time by joe gores hate that word i was born in boston and educated at harvard business but when i was in the army i was stationed down south and heard too much of it going back to the base after a night in town wed see them riding in the back of the bus they had their own waiting rooms rest rooms restaurants theater entrances everything here in san francisco we treat our negroes just like we treat our orientals and were damned proud of it despite anything duane duganhes from dallas texas might say barb and i have been paying the terrific rent at miss barrets just so we could have the apartment next to the dugans because duane is magnins hottest young executive and through him i hope to get their account for colt sheppard and davis but when he used that word in the elevator day before yesterday i caught him right up a what you know i hate that word duane okay buddybuddy call it the shadowed livery of the burnished sun but i tell you that one moved in upstairs yesterday be reasonable duane the cheapest apartment in the place is one seventyfive a month and the number of them that could afford he was lugging a bunch of boxes into eightysix probably just delivering a tv set or something number eightysix is the eighth apartment on the sixth floor duane and i were on four as we stepped out of the elevator duane grabbed my arm how about you being reasonable buddybuddy you know damned well that the naacp has agents out all the time guys they pay to go around just trying to get refused rooms or apartments or drinks so they can cause trouble what do you want to do for christs sake go burn a cross on his door i jerked my arm loose and went into the apartment duane might have blue eyes that can blaze like rockets and he might have played guard for smu and have forty pounds on me and he might even represent the magnin account but guys with his basic attitudes do more harm to this countrys prestige abroad than every nuclear device weve ever tested and i wasnt going to let him back me down barb wasnt home but it was a nice afternoon so i went to the back balcony and looked down at the pool it made me feel better just to see her below sunning herself with those long tanned thoroughbred legs and that honeygolden hair as pretty as a starlets hey lovely lady she looked up and waved and that wonderful smile that i always feel right down to my toes lit up her face her gesture made the slanting afternoon sun cast exciting shadows down the dip of her suit i was glad it was friday afternoon and wed be able to stay in bed late the next morning come on down the waters fine dont kid me ill bet you havent even gotten wet yet i have too i went down and in a breathless water fight made sure that she got wet after a quick plunge id gotten over my irritation with duane and had even forgotten about the negro who was supposed to have moved in the sun was still half an hour above the high redwood fence around the pool area so we stretched out sidebyside on the warm cement i was almost dozing when barb said honey has miss barret gotten herself a chauffeur or something huh then i grunted drowsily i dont know baby but the rent she charges she could afford a brace of em like russian wolf hounds and she could afford a brace of those too why an absolutely huge negro man bowed to me on the stairs today when i was coming back from the hairdressers she gave a wicked little wiggle that she never learned at bryn mawr unless it was during a certain football weekend at harvard and just before you got home i was sure i saw him again staring at me over the balcony of one of the sixthfloor apartments i was wide awake by then dont tell me youre going to start in on me too baby before colt sheppard and davis moved us out here last january i dont believe barb had seen a dozen negroes in her life i never took her slumming in harlem or even to the village during the two years we were in new york and where she comes from in connecticut you couldnt find enough negroes to field a basketball team but shes gotten this idea maybe from seeing gone with the wind too often as a kid that a negro in negro digest april a white apartment house just must be a domestic im not starting in on you herbie i just said that i saw a negro upstairs today and that i wondered im sorry i snapped baby especially on a friday night when weve got a whole weekend ahead of us and im having sexual urges its just that duane dugan claimed in the elevator today that a negro has moved in upstairs youre kidding dugan isnt hes convinced of it not only that he swears this guy is an naacp agent but you know all southerners are paranoid on the subject of negroes in general and the naacp in particular by then barb was more excited than she was last christmas over the pearls ill have paid for next year so i had to tell her the whole conversation ill bet thats just who he is she exclaimed triumphantly when id finished ill bet hes just waiting for someone to start trouble and then hell bring a lawsuit and the naacp wouldnt get to first base working that way baby not in this apartment house not with miss barret if you think theres anything about con that old gal doesnt know look at our rent but she wouldnt let go of it so i finally said all right then wench of my heart tomorrow about noon when we get out of bed were going upstairs and ask her we had a wine and candlelight dinner and it was nearly noon before we got up to the landladys yesterday as wed known she would she invited us in for cafe au lait and croissantsshe has a lot of oldworld ideas she once said that the bone structure of barbs face indicated true breedingand i opened up our subject casually with the cream and sugar say i hear that weve gotten some new tenants in eightysix miss barret is of indeterminate age stocky and grey and she wears clothes that are truly stylish and is the only woman ive ever met who can use a cigarette holder with elegance she was educated in france and once told us that at a parisian garden partythis was before world war iishe informed charles de gaulle that he had a very large nose and de gaulle responded gertrude it is not assez grand to interfere with my drinking which is all i care about with gallic gestures this always breaks barb up anyway when i asked miss barret about the new tenants her eyes lighted up and she exclaimed have you met them yet a charming couple not yet duane dugan said hed seen the husband in the hall she threw back her head and pealed out a ringing laugh something few women can do without sounding like a polly adler girl i imagine that mr dugan considering his geographical antecedents was disturbed to the point of trauma mr veli is a melanesian from the fiji islands now permanently attached to the staff of the british embassy here in san francisco but im afraid that a southerners unselective eye would see him only as a gardenvariety american negro barb glanced at me and said i guess duanes noun was more colloquial than that and some of the laughter left miss barrets eyes doubtless that is a word which i hope someday will be stricken from our language except as an historical curiosity but i fear the purgation will not occur in my lifetime nor perhaps even in yours we thanked her for the coffee and sweet rolls and got out the porsche for a drive across the golden gate to sausalito and made it back in time for an afternoon dip we didnt see either duane or the new tenants at the pool but miss barret had made us both awfully curious as we were dripping our way up the back stairs toward our apartment barb showed a flaw in her liberal education honey im a little hazy about the exact location of the fiji islands youre asking me i was five years too young for the war in the pacific but i remember reading in holiday that the fijis were close enough to tonga for trading and occasional intermarriage and i know from cinerama south seas that the tongans are lightskinned polynesians i suppose this ratu veli is a little more suntanned than average and that duanes texas imagination did the rest mmf that was all i got until we were in the apartment and towelling off in time to offenbach and then she said as if there hadnt been a break in the conversation you can say dark polynesian but i saw our mr veli in the hall yesterday you didnt and im not convinced her eyes were sparkling as they do when she gets a deliciously naughty idea shall we beard the lion in his den black lions miss smartypants arent really black im not going to get any peace until youre satisfied am i no she said complacently so after dinnerthis was last eveningwe went up their name was in the slot beside the door mr and mrs ratu veli oxen ab i wasnt sure theyd be home on a saturday night but veli answered as soon as i pushed the buzzer and barb never finished what shed started to say when the door opened we were staring at that mans pectoral muscles i am fiveeleven a tennis and my eyes were just chest level on him he was not only tall with a tremendous knot of kinky hair all over his black skull he was broad enough to have to go through doors sideways and since wed caught him wearing just a decorated cloth wraparounda sulu i read in holidayand a white shirt open to the waist i knew there was no fat on him his feet were bare each foot was as long and as broad as a ream of legal paper but their pigment in fact his overall hue was right out of the lamp shade i my name is herbert benson i got it out somehow even though my voice was strange in my own ears this is my wife barbara we live downstairs and we thought thought wed visit thought good neighbors barb was having the same trouble with her voice that i was he was so damned big and black his eyes which were soft as a does looked pleased and he stuck out a hand the size of a squash racket delighted im ratu veli his voice was beautifully modulated and incongruously british just astounding from that enormous frame he turned towards the kitchen called mother put on the tea cosy visitors and then swung back towards us and went on wonderfully decent of you chaps to pop in this way his wife called from the kitchen that shed be half a second her hands were full of cookie dough and i shot a look at barb to see if she remembered our joke about the lion because veli moved with the sinuous grace of a black_panther and saw by her face that she did i surprised another expression there too something i hadnt expected well that was the damnedest half hour ive ever spent watching barb drinking tea and eating english muffins with marmalade and showing no slightest revulsion i was so proud of her that i could have hugged her we chatted right along with them and turned down their invitations to the ballet and the little theater and a soccer game at balboa stadium in the park without being obvious about it at all we learned that veli is eight years older than i am was a noncom in the fijian scouts during world war iihe said it as though i should know what they were that the oxen ab stands for what i thought it did and that he holds the victoria cross his wife brought that up but not as if she were showing him off he sounded like a bright guy but wed learned all we had to know when his woman walked through the kitchen door my jaw muscles are still stiff from holding that awful frozen grin in place we went all the way down to our apartment and were actually inside before barb let out her breath in a big whoosh you too i asked me too were young moderns as the ladies magazines put it and im as liberal as the next girl but i dont have to repeat it all she was talking from a sort of shock and women especially american women who have had a lifetime of leisure to perfect the art can attack a female they find offensive in really vicious terms but last night i agreed with barb all the way i went halfway through the yellow pages before i found a mover who was open on sunday and i agreed to his price without haggling when i turned in the keys this morning i sure got straightened out about miss barret and her phony culture i started to say that id been recalled by phone to the head office in new york but she cut me off short i take it that in a spirit of daring and gay adventure you visited mr veli and his wife last night and his wife yes maam she had me stammering already but that has nothing to do i mean this transfer is sudden and she burst out you disappoint terribly mr benson your wife knows of this fully knows and approves yes maam i mean of course shes going with me i wouldnt be transferred without my wife and pleasespare my intelligence mr benson you may consider the week before your rent is due as sufficient notice of vacating then she took the keys from my hand and started to close the door and then opened it again and said something to me in frenchcalled me something i thinkthat i bet she didnt learn at any garden party with charlie de gaulle it made me a little sore that she wouldnt believe my explanation about why were moving tomorrow ill put in a change of address at the post office so she wont have the satisfaction of knowing that were still here in town twenty minutes ago i dug duane dugan out of bed to tell him that i was moving and to give him the name of the hotel where well be until we find a new apartment i hated to ruin his sunday morning but because of the magnin account i dont want to lose touch he answered the door barefoot and in pajamas his curly brown hair rumpled and listened to what i had to say you give us southerners a lot of heat about civil_rights but now you see what its gotten you fifty years ago one of them living like that right out in the open wed have lynched him in texas now theres nothing either of us can do buddybuddy im sure as hell not going to let him chase me out of my apartment i didnt say any more southerners are the ones who are supposed to have the intense personal pride and it wasnt his wife who was down by the swimming pool as i said ive always been for a good full life for our negroes and i always will be but i also spent two years as an enlisted man in the army and we had three of them in my barracks uneducated arrogant touchy about their color and i know all about how these people think call him a melanesian or any other euphemism you want when i see a black man living with a white woman with blonde hair and blue eyes and a peachesandcream skin and a british accent and when i see in my wifes eyes along with the disgust something she would never admit even to herself then im moving out from caution not prejudice because this ratu veli has what every black man who ever lived hungers after and the british accent and the degree from some overrated european university and the phony war medal wont make any difference his race has only evolved so far hes seen barb in a tight swimming suit and eventually hed go for her thats why its just common sense for me to move out of miss barrets thats why though i utterly loathe the thinking that inspires that word the southerners use i dont want the one in apartment eightysix living upstairs from me not when im away at the office all day not when my wife is home alone not after ive seen that expression in her eyes when she looks at him si ssi e by john a williams sissie duncan aging and gray lies dying in a los angeles hospital waiting for her two surviving children to arrive for that last visit oliver the mate of her later life stands by anxious and loving on the plane winging in from new york ralph joplin and his sister iristrying not to focus on the fearful presentremember moments from the past that past had been grim and turbulent marked with death and degradation and despair the past of the negro in america the story of ralph and iris is different however for they are not children of the south he was born in upstate new york and she was born in chicago but the difference is only one of geography and naturally being a negro man ralph knows this better than iris as a woman iris al most escaped she remembers the lewd passes the white fraternity boys used to make at her and how she felt facing the white girl sissie worked for while wearing a sweater the girl had thrown away but iris has spent the last years in europe where she is a successful singer with a big apartment in barcelona a spanish maid and a citroen and she is about as free as a negro can ever be but these people the central characters in john a williams fine new novel sissie farrar are tethered by the subtle and steely chains that bind all human beings it is one of the glowing virtues of this simple deep and moving novel that it effectively deals with the most secret and intimateand crushing relationships of sissie and her family sissie might have beenas her prototype so often is in novelsthe allprotective allknowing allsuffering mother bravely battling the cruel and uncaring world to bring up her children and to give them the chance that was denied her but john a williams is a more honest and perceiving writer than that sissie is not such a story at all sissie is a fullblown woman as frail and uncertain as most and as ignoble as many and ralph and iris the children who love her understand that though they sometimes hated her sissies journey from the rural cabin in mississippi to a middle class bungalow in california was a manyfaceted triumph and they know too despite all else that the success they have as playwright and chanteuse was founded in large measure on the strength that sissie willed them john a williams whose night song last year won him the coveted prix de rome and who subsequently became the first winner of that award refused by the american academy in rome is a mature artist gifted with and then we heard the thunder by john o killens there are all kinds of reasons for hailing and then we heard the thunder knopf john o killens new novel about negro gis in world war ii in the first place the novel is some years overdue there have been innumerable novels good and badby white writers telling the awful story of that awful war from their vantage point norman mailer that sensitive artist who sometimes now seems to be stumbling dangerously toward derangement first exploded into literary life with his own tale of trial by fire the naked and the dead john horne burns a finer and even more sensitive artist if that is possible dewhites understood negroes the frustration of educated solly saunders in his efforts to advance on merit alone in an army which judged him first as a negro and the cruel irony of men facing danger and death to destroy the twinheaded monster of fascism and racism abroad when that same monster held them prisoner at home and then we heard the thunder is not merely a protest novel as many critics are sure to term it it is a rich complex and believable story of men swept up in a stream of events both historic and violent from the reception center in new jersey to the training center in georgia and on to the pacific battlegrounds the novel moves with vitality and conviction what happened to the negros religion by the rev mr james f campbell n recent years the american negro has made great progress in civil_rights job opportunities housing and even in politics yet there is very definitely a decline in his interest and participation in religion statistics point out that more people are going to church in america today than ever before but of course this statistic is proportional and this is why it is easily refuted when referred to the negro yes there has been a population increase among negroes but at the same time the negros attendance at church and his religious enthusiasm has not kept pace with this increase at one point in the negros life religion was foremost all of his activities were centered around his religion and his church his religion gave him a sense of pride and dignity and even in his sins he felt an obligation to think and act religiously he possessed a deep consciousness of religion inwardly he believed that the things he hoped for and sought would come to him by way of his religion it may easily be said that the negro of yesteryear could be compared favorably with the jew who has always believed that god is first in life and from him comes the benefits of life there was a keen awareness of god in the negros life and his heart was rich with religious vigor but this is not true today from all indications there is a definite lag in the negros religious interests there seems to be a shyness among negroes when confronted with religion it is appalling to note the coolness that is shown throughout the nation toward the church and its activities in years gone by sunday meant going to church for the great majority of negroes and even though the statistics say america has more churchgoers today than ever before this is not true of the negro there is a drastic decline in the attendance of public worship no longer is sunday a big day for going to church todays negro would just as soon go bowling or spend the day at the beach why this is hard to figure i talked with a negro who has a top job with a science foundation his job is to travel around the nation and secure capable high school students who are interested in careers in science he told me that years ago he never failed to go to church whether he was home or away but now he says i almost never go when i asked him why he said he didnt know for one thing the problem cannot be blamed on poor leadership and church activities negro churches today have better trained ministers than ever before and they have good programs too if many of our ancestors could be restored to life again and were permitted to attend their former churches most of them would think they were in college thats just how much progress has been made in negro church life of course there is the danger of overprogramming but we cannot accuse the church of not having a problem perhaps the problem can to a degree be attributed to the negros liberation from poverty and fear the present day negro has a good income and he no longer has fear of being rejected because he knows the courts are on his side already a great number of his prayers have been answered maybe we are characteristic of the people of the old testament who after receiving deliverance from god forsook him about church attendance dont mention night worship service except for metropolitan areas with large churches and many hundreds to draw from you can almost count the number of negro churches that have sunday night services it is almost a thing of the past i will admit that there are some exceptions even in small places yet by contrast far more of the white churches proportionately are having night services i really feel that the negro has let the white man surpass him in the one thing that he alone possessed namely the integrity of religious practices why has this come about this is still hard to figure but perhaps the negros rise to social prominence has made its toll along with the negros rise in jobs and housing he has also found new meaning as a social being he has come about this with pointed interest and enthusiasm and in the process has seemingly overrun one of the most important aspects of life rather than spend his sunday evenings in church he is spending them in the homes of his friends and other places of entertainment sad as it may seem many negroes have taken an attitude of indifference toward religion it is practically an attitude of rebellion they simply dont care to be associated with any religious group there used to be a time when the negro was easily led to believe in god you could tell him that if he did not seek to live a godly life he would go to hell and this was frightening to him so consequently he sought to live daily by religious laws and beliefs but today with the great boom of liberalism and radicalism this kind of reasoning seems like folly to the negro he is far more objec tive than ever before and today he does a good job of matching an idea or a philosophy of life when you tell him something you may have to prove it he even feels quite capable of questioning divine existence years ago this was almost unheard of in the negro society except on college campuses but today this is done on a large scale freedom of belief is a great democratic ideal yet it can be very detrimental if it does not have its limits too many negroes have undoubtedly become obsessed with the idea of achieving and in so doing have denied themselves any growth and nurture from the supreme being integration has played its role too if we had the power to turn back the clock of integration we would not because integration has answered many of our hopes and aspirations but on the other hand i it too has made an apparent contri i bution to the declining religious life i of the american negro many ne i groes resent the fact that for a long i time the negro has been stigma i tized as a religionist in his quest i for integration he would like to be i accepted without being prejudged i in order to avoid this the negro i would rather appear irreligious or i even sacrilegious this seems to i be just how important total accept i ance would be to some people i any reason i have given for this i lag is not excusable in the final an i alysis this has to mean the negro has lost and abused a great privilege and a valuable asset granted all men religion when used understood and practiced wholesomely never fails to assist in making a better mankind it is something to be proud of and to improve it has been said that many times we condemn the things we passionately admire but far too often we deny ourselves of the things we really need and eventually we will discover that these things cant be done without wait till next year by howard n meyer readers who y are old enough to remember the baseball era before jackie j robinson joined the brooklyn dodgers will recall the chant that sports writers used to attribute to the local aficionados as their team finished out of the running wait till next year was the cry and even as it was uttered there was a mutual unacknowledged understanding that next year would never come during the days of my youth it never did school desegregation seems to be as hopelessly stalled today as the brooklyn baseball team ever was for over two and a half million negro children those living in the states of the former confederacy it seems that next year will never comeunless there is a drastic change in the temper of our people followed by a similar change in the conduct of our government we have just experienced the ninth september schoolopening since the supreme court affirmed the principle that racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional eight and a half years have passed since the court ruled unanimously that all provisions of federal state or local law requiring or permitting such discrimination must yield to this principle what did the ninth september produce in reviewing the first weeks developments u s attorney general kennedy commented that this was the second consecutive year in which every public school system being desegregated for the first time made this important transition without public disorder but one needs only to study the statistics to see that very little occurred except in new orleans parochial schools that would cause a segregationist to take the trouble to be disorderly the plain simple and unvarnished truth is that the united states constitution has been nullified in eleven states with only a few exceptions and token ones at that in large urban centers on the seventh anniversary of the court desegregation decision united press international described the period that had passed as the seven lean years and noted that the overall gain in terms of negro pupils in desegregated classes stood at a meager per cent the year and a half that have since elapsed give no promise that the lean years will be followed by seven fat ones the socalled regional overall average as given by the admirably objective southern education reporting service will probably remain under per cent after this years returns are in unfortunately the regional average bad as it is analyzes out to a gross overstatement of what has been really achieved the per cent figure is obtained by lumping together the socalled border states which remained loyal during the civil war with oklahoma and the district of columbia and tabulating with them the exconfederate states if the latter are taken separately as a group the following picture emerges using sers figures of the more than negro children of school age in those eleven states a gross total of were in school with white children by may of and if we exclude texas whose western region accounts for most of that states contribution to the we have ten states with a total of almost two and one half million negro school age children of whom under three thousand are in school with whites another tiny sprinkling was admitted this september whatever the final total the essential picture will remain the same another way of looking at it is from the point of view of the school board there are such groups of local public officials in the eleven states in question each sworn to uphold law and order and presumably the u s constitution only of these school boards have taken any steps toward desegregation it would seem that something must be lacking in our methods of securing compliance with law if the results to date are so disheartening there was published last year a careful and useful study of the performance of the united states district court judges in school desegregation cases in the southern states about the most serious error in the book is its title lonely men that would seem to convey the impression that it is a study of fiftyeight heroic judicial figures standing firm as isolated bastions of constitutional right not quite while there have been and continue to be notable exceptions such as skelly wright of new orleans who was promoted but because of senatorial resistance to a post in washington d cthe average district court judge has not been a lonely pillar of justice in school segregation cases the author of lonely men professor j w peltason of the university of illinois would be the first to agree that nothing could be further from the truth than this idealized picture he has studied the more than two hundred lawsuits launched over a sevenyear period in the effort to compel obedience to the requirements of the constitution at the local school board level his conclusions by and large federal judges applied the law adversely to the claims of negroes the refusal of some of the district judges to clamp down on recalcitrant boards has had a cumulatively adverse impact on the other judges the supreme court has declared public school segregation unconstitutional but many southern federal district judges had permitted the evasion of the consequences of those decisions the judges have approved programs that will keep most negroes in segregated institutions until long beyond the time when even those now starting first grade will have graduated in his book prof peltason tells us with keen insight into the nature of the judicial process just why that process cannot succeed in reforming the offending school systerns some of the obstacles encountered were inevitable builtin as it were in judicial procedure others not so foreordained nevertheless have been erected and made a rocky road wellnigh impassable there has been for example the fact that the district judge is very much a part of the life of the south the author might have been more precise and said the white south and hence reluctant even when seeking to apply the law as laid down by higher courts to take action that will arouse hostility in the community of which he is a part the effect is sometimes not easily pinpointed but there are so many ways in which by delay in holding hearings by upholding technical objections by making the path of the suitor harder in one way or another the judge can deny justice unanticipated and gave difficulties were created by the march manifesto of the ninetysix congressmen from the south who promised their constituencies to use all lawful means to resist the enforcement of law by dignifying the posture of defiance and contributing to the illusion that the supreme courts unanimous interpretation might somehow be set aside they gave the segregationists a major breakthrough school boards took due notice and the judges in the federal courts were faced with an additional inhibition and a further source of actively hostile community sentiment shortly after the little rock episode as we need to be reminded the rumor spread in washington that president eisenhower had said privately that he wished the supreme court had never ruled against segregation and had also said that he felt the southern communities should proceed more slowly confronted at a press conference with this rumor the president declared in his deathless prose i might have said something about slower but i do believe that we shouldbecause i do say as i did yesterday or last week we have got to have reason and sense and education and a lot of other developments that go hand in hand as this processif this process is going to have any real acceptance in the united states the presidents statement was hardly calculated to encourage a lonely federal judge to stand up to the segregationists a reflection of such difficulties can be seen in the retreat of the courts when faced with the pupil placement or pupil assignment laws devised in some of the resisting states to create additional obstacles to those who would take steps to vindicate their childrens constitutional rights in court these are probably the greatest and most enduring of all the obstacles to school desegregation erected during the seven lean years just past and it is a fair statement that until they are broken down the device of token desegregation will stall further progress some twenty years ago an eminent sociologist an associate of gunnar myrdal wrote that the american south is the only place in the world today where one can get a reputation for being a liberal simply by urging obedience to law and where conservatives regularly violate the law true as this statement remains today it needs to be elaborated by the addition of another aspect one can get a reputation as a moderate by urging the community to pretend to obey the law by token compliance what of the future the kennedy administration which has in many ways lived up to its campaign pledges to act against discrimination on every front has not changed significantly the course of events spotlighted in lonely men it was not long after his induction that the new attorney general speaking in georgia forthrightly declared that if the orders of the court are circumvented the department of justice will act we will not stand by or be aloof we will move however the civil_rights crisis in the schools is not so much due to the circumvention of i existing court orders as it is to the i difficulty of securing meaningful i court orders and enough of them i it took two hundred lawsuits i each one privately financed to gain i the admission of the handful of stu i dents who have entered a few i schools not only must each law i suit be privately financed but in i each case a family or group of families must come forward separately in each school district and face the threat of economic reprisals or worse will we ever know the full story of what happened to the negro families whose children at first entered and then withdrew from the parochial school at buras to have a profound and revolutionary readjustment of race relations in the schools depend on privately financed lawsuits with volunteer plaintiffs is utterly unsatisfactory except as professor peltason points out to the segregationists negroes lack the political power to force school boards to integrate their only choice is to litigate and to persuade a judge to command the board to act segregationists do not fear this as long as the national government does not interfere there will obviously be no change in the school situation until there is new legislation there have been plenty of proposals but the kennedy administration has not as yet seen fit to identify itself with any one of them or put forward any of its own presumably the administration has refrained from asking for new legislation in respect to school desegregation either because of a fear of adverse effect on the balance of the legislative program or because of lack of prospect of passage yet it is hard to see how the presidents program could have fared much worse as to lack of prospect of passage it would seem that if the administration were to have brought the facts to the people there might have been a reaction strong enough to get some sort of legislation the eisenhower administration produced civil_rights laws on the subject of voting that while far from perfect or complete have given attorney general kennedy and his civil_rights chief burke marshall tools to move in on the grosser instances of disenfranchisement early in the kennedy administration the congress gave the president an unusual chance to eliminate roadblocks in civil_rights litigation but the opportunity was not seized upon there had developed in the last years of the eisenhower administration a great need for additional federal judgeships throughout the united states to meet the problem of overloaded dockets and court congestion on may the omnibus judgeship bill was passed creating seventythree new federal court posts of these twentynine vacancies were to be filled in states with recurrent civil_rights problems unfortunately as walter dean burnham recently wrote in these pages no president is strong enough to have his way against the entrenched custom of senatorial courtesy the practical significance of that powerful political tradition is that judges appointed by a democratic president are really nominated by segregationist senators consider in this connection the number one appointment made by president kennedy under the omnibus judgeship bill that of william harold cox an associate of senator eastland it seems according to another of our national traditions that when a presidential appointee is acceptable to both of the senators from the state where he resides the rest of the senate liberal or conservative follows a courtesy practice or hands off rule when mr cox was nominated to the federal bench for the district of mississippi there was merely a pro forma hearing and no objection was raised to the nomination compare the ordeal of thurgood marshall judge coxbellwether of the appointments under the omnibus billdid not lose much time in making clear where he stood on the issues that would come before him a federal civil_rights statute of long standing has provided that a state criminal prosecution wherein civil_rights are involved may be transferred to the local federal court in order to assure protection of those rights counsel for a group of the freedom riders sought to so transfer their clients cases the move was rejected by judge cox decisions on such transfer removal cases are nonappealable so that we shall never know whether he was right or wrong in a technical sense but in his decision judge cox gave expression to selfrevealing dicta and characterizations the riders he declared judically came from other states for provocative purposes their destination was jackson but their objective was trouble this court may not be regarded as any haven for any such counterfeit citizens from other states deliberately seeking to cause trouble here among its people what provoked judge coxs denunciation was the quiet entry of whites and negroes into socalled white waiting rooms and lunch counters in interstate travel facilities unfortunately judge cox has not been the only judicial appointee foisted on the president by a democratic state organizationand approved let it be added by the american bar associationwho proved to be an embarrassment and a fierce foe of certain constitutional requirements frank ellis of the ellenderlong organization who was appointed to succeed j skelly wright in new orleans hardly waited until the latter got on the train to leave the state before voiding his desegregation orders which were later only partially reinstated by an appellate court more recent and dramatic was the performance of talmadge henchman j robert elliott of georgia who unashamedly issued without a hearing an injunction against the peaceful protest activities of the albany movement shortly afterwards there was administered the rebuke of summary revocation of his order by an appellate judge but that has not deterred judge elliott from continuing to dispense his own brand of justice these are extreme cases it would be wrong to imply that the average southern federal judge takes his oath of office with mental reservation or purpose of evasion as to the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments but the bulk of the recent appointees give no promise of departing from the pattern of conduct of the roosevelttrumaneisenhower appointees whose performance is studied and found wanting in lonely men the lesson to be derived from all this is that the federal district courts by reason of the character and origin of their personnel and limitations of the lawsuitbylawsuit method are not qualified to continue to preside over so farreaching a reform as the change in the practices of three thousand different local school boards this major social problem calls for the functioning of a single national administrative agency equipped with investigative and enforcement powers very much like those of the federal trade commission or the national labor relations board such an agency could act with speed flexibility that would enable it to cope with evasion and a forcefulness that will come from freedom from local roots and pressures it could devote itself to the singleminded pursuit of compliance with the constitution its orders to cease and desist could be enforced by the federal courts of appealwithout the intervention of a district judgeand the authority of the courts of appeal to review or revise such orders could be limited to the extremely narrow scope reserved for appeals from administrative agencies such a plan and agency would be beyond doubt constitutional section five of the fourteenth amendment expressly provides that congress shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article the right to bargain collectively is not endowed by the constitution it is merely a statutory right yet it is enforced by the effective method of administrative action why should there not be an administrative remedy for deprivation of such a constitutional right as access to an unsegregated school an agency of this nature being truly national in scope would be equipped and obliged to investigate intervene and act in the many situations at the north east and west that have been lumped together under the head of de facto segregation a national body can and should be out gunning for the northern discriminationist as well as the southern segregationist why should the underprivileged families of engel wood n j and mai verne l i los angeles and chicagoto name only a few where phases of this same problem have cropped up in various guiseshave to chip in from meager resources to pay the cost of expensive and longdrawnout litigation one should not of course be under any illusions any legislation let alone effective legislation to enforce the constitutional rights of american children will not be easy to pass it will require the development of a seething burning massive public demanda demand that is not yet in sight not until our collective conscience is aroused to action will our government respond but just as each citizen has an obligation to act to be heard from so too the president has an obligation to give us leadership when the american people are properly aroused no sectional veto or filibuster will stand in the way but as professor peltason says until those favoring school integration fight as hard for civil_rights as segregationists are fighting against them southern schools will remain segregated as long as the schools in any area remain segregated the really basic facts of race relations will remain the sameregardless of whether white lavatories at bus terminals are thrown open to all or whether the second secretary of the upper volta legation can get a meal on route these are the surface the vitals of our difficulty are largely untouchedtotal segregation in most exconfederate areas and economic and residential discrimination throughout the nation voting rights are important but school segregation is the very heart of the issue it plays an overwhelming and selfperpetuating role as both the cause and the effect of prejudice charles sumner great massachusetts senator of a century ago who saw so much so far ahead of his time stated the issue over a decade before the civil war when he vainly sought to persuade the massachusetts court to desegregate the boston school system the worst aspect of segregated schools he said is that they tend to deepen and perpetuate the odious distinction of caste founded in a deeprooted prejudice in public opinion one of the most challenging statements i ever saw on this subject was the opening of an address by the rev raymond t bosler last year on the catholic hour we americans are an impatient people he said we are proud of the fact we want results and we want them right now we are impatient about everything under the sun except one thing and about this one thing we are extremely virtuous we are not only most patient we are most prudent about it this is not the way americans ordinarily approach a problem this is untypical of america and when you come right down to it everything about the race problem is untypical it doesnt fit into the american picture and that is why we ought to get rid of it right away it is time we approached the race problem in the typical american mannerwith impatience with a determination to get results immediate results what is holding us back the recovery of by kwame nkrumah istinguished scholars it is an honour and privilege for me to welcome you to ghana and to this first africanist conference your meeting here within the ramparts of an african university is a reflection of africas recovery and reawakening it is also a recognition of the new spirit which now animates the people of this great continent it is even edifying that this congress is taking place on african soil i know that you who have gathered here represent various fields and branches of learning in fact i see familiar faces of professors of universities and academies what has impelled you distinguished scholars to gather here at such a time as this you are here and are united by the fact that you want to find out the truth about africa and when you have found out to proclaim it to the world scholarly and academic interest in africa is not a new venture the desire to know more about africa has been expressed from the very earliest times because africa has been the questionmark of history to a roman proconsul semper aliquid novi ex africa from the imaginings of the ancient geographers an inaccurate and distorted picture of africa often emerged south of the atlas ranges a sandy desert was believed to extend indefinitely with here and there a providential oasis a rivulet which nibbling and corroding its way through the sandy wastes dripped into the sea even so the ancients had some genuine knowledge of the african continent for they had a scientific curiosity about it thus erastostheses and aristotle knew that the cranes migrated as far as the lakes where the nile had its source and both of them thought that it was there that the pygmies dwelt among the travellers of the ancient world who tried to explore africa we may recall men like strabo and hanno of carthage after these early travels foreign knowledge of africa became static until a new impetus was given to it by the arabs and the chinese the arabs and the chinese discovered and chronicled a succession of powerful african kingdoms one of these kingdoms was that of ghana the pomp of whose court was the admiration of that ageand also of ours it bred and developed within its borders the instruments of civilisation and art its palaces were of solid architectural construction complete with glass windows murals and sculpture and the thrones within the palaces were bedecked with gold there were other kingdoms such as those of shonghay sala berissa the renowned empires of bornu wangara melli the historians tell us that these empires and kingdoms were maintained with remarkable efficiency and administrative competence their splendour was proverbial in mediaeval times the chinese too during the tang dynasty ad published their earliest major records of africa in the th century scholarship connected egypt with china but chinese acquaintance with africa was not confined to knowledge of egypt only they had detailed knowledge of somaliland madagascar and zanzibar and made extensive visits to other parts of africa the european exploration of africa reached its height in the th century what is unfortunate however is the fact that much of the discovery was given a subjective instead of an objective interpretation in the regeneration of learning which is taking place in our universities and in other institutions of higher learning we are treated as subjects and not objects they forget that we are a historic people responsible for our unique forms of language culture and society it is therefore proper and fitting that a congress of africanists should take place in africa and that the concept of africanism should desolve from and be animated by that congress between ancient times and the th century some european scholars forgot what their predecessors in african studies had known this amnesia this regrettable loss of interest in the power of the african mind deepened with growth of interest in the economic exploitation of africa it is no wonder that the portuguese were erroneously credited with having erected the stone fortress of mashonaland which even when barbossa cousin of magellan first visited them were ruins of long standing i have said that the pursuit of african studies is not a new experience but the motives which have led various scholars to undertake these studies have been diverse we can distinguish first a true scientific curiosity most of the persian greek and roman travelers exhibited this motive even when as in the case of the romans they had a primary military purpose they still tried and often succeeded in preserving some sense of objectivity arab explorers were also often unbiased in their accounts of africa and indeed we are grateful to them for much of what they wrote concerning our past by the time the early european writings on africa got underway a new motive had begun to inform african studies those early european works exchanged the scientific motive for one that was purely economic there was the unbalanced trade in ivory and gold and there was the illegitimate trafficking in men for which these writings needed to find some sort of excuse the point i wish to make at this stage is that much of european and american writing on africa was at that time apologetic it was devoted to an attempt to justify slavery and the continued exploitation of african labour and resources african studies in europe and america were thus at their lowest ebb scientifically with the abolition of the slave trade african studies could no longer be inspired by the economic motive the experts in african studies therefore changed the contents and direction of their writings they began to give accounts of african society which were used to justify colonialism as a duty of civilisation even the most flattering of these writings fell short of objectivity and truth this explains i believe the popularity and success of anthropology as the main segment of african studies the stage was then set for the economic and political subjugation of africa africa therefore was unable to look forward or backward the central myth in the mythology surrounding africa is that of the denial that we are a historical people it is said that whereas other continents have shaped history and determined its course africa has stood still held down by inertia africa it is said entered history only as a result of european contact its history therefore is widely felt to be an extension of european history hegels authority was lent to this ahistorical hypothesis concerning africa and apologists of colonialism and imperialism lost little time in seizing upon it and writing wildly about it to their hearts content to those who say that there is no documentary source for that period of african history which predates the european contact modern research has a crushing answer we know that we were not without a tradition of historiography and that this is so is now the verdict of true africanists african historians by the end of the th century had a tradition of recorded history and certainly by the time when mohamud alkati wrote tarikh alfattash this tradition was incidentally much much wider than that of the timbuktu school of historians and our own institute of african studies here at this university is bringing to light several chronicles relating to the history of northern ghana particularly those of alhajj usmanu of those chronicles the most exciting traced down to date appears to be the isnad alshuykh wa ilulama written around by alhajj muhama ben mustafa who lived in western gonja it gives details of the conversion of the dynasty in a great deal of interesting work has been done and continues to be done in learned centres in africa in nigeria for example dr dike has worked on politics and trade in the niger delta here he reflects like other africanist scholars a new africancentred approach to the study of the relations between the delta states and europe in the th century in this connection the collaboration of archaeologists historians and anthropologists studying different aspects of the history institutions and culture of precolonial africa has produced beneficial results a large collection of manuscripts and other evidence helping this adventure has now been made in many african centres of learning at the university of dakar for example i understand that a great deal has been collected in the way of documentary material relating to the history of the western sudan in mali also considerable work is being done on precolonial history and the museum at bamako has gathered a great deal of material both useful and fascinating in guinea too the story of the contact between europe and africa is being written as an african experience and not as a european adventure similar work is being successfully undertaken in the ivory coast in upper volta there is the important work of professor kizerbo on the moshi kingdom and he has for some months now been working happily and successfully in our institute of african studies as an expression of the cultural unity of africa in east africa a great deal of progressive work continues to be done documents and inscriptions in egez and amharic in swahili and arabic in old nubian and meroitic are being collected in order to make possible our authentic reinterpretation of our past in sudan in ethiopia in tanganyika in somalia kenya uganda everywhere in africa there is purposeful effort to bring to light those means which alone will enable us to present our history as the history of the african people the history of our actions and of the ideology and principles behind them the history of our sufferings and our triumphs this congress among other things is an attempt to share experience in this common endeavour many of these sources are documents and documents written in african languages are coming to light thus apart from hausa there are vast collections written in fufulde kanuri nupe dagbani these are mainly th century documents but they reflect a tradition of learning which goes back to the mediaeval times but our historical records do not consist alone in the facts which we committed in the arabic script every society has methods of preserving facts about its past and where a society has no literate traditions it devises rigorous methods of oral recording scholars who have studied this phenomenon know this well historical recording in africa therefore rightly comprises the documents in arabic and african languages on the one hand and on the other the wellpreserved and authentic records of oral tradition our inheritance of oral literature of epic and lyric poetry of stories and legends praise songs and the chronicles of states and dynasties preserved by palace officials is of intrinsic interest and merit as it is of historical importance the history of a nation is unfortunately too easily written as the history of its dominant class if the history of a nation of a people cannot be found in the history of a class how much less can the history of a continent be found in what is not even a part of iteurope and yet this is precisely what many a european historian has done in the past the history of africa has with them been european centred africa was only the space in which europe swelled up the african past was ignored or dismissed in these tendentious works as not contributing to or affecting the european expansion and presence in africa if africas history is interpreted in terms of the interests of european merchandise and capital missionaries and administrators it is no wonder that african nationalism is regarded as a perversion and colonialism as a virtue you who are meeting here today in the first congress of africanists are all representatives of various disciplines and are determined to pool your immense knowledge of africa for the progress of the african your efforts mark a renascence of scientific curiosity in the study of africa and should be directed at an objective impartial scrutiny and assessment of things african while some of us are engaged with the political unification of africa africanists everywhere must also help in building the spiritual and cultural foundations for the unity of our continent in east africa in the sudan in egypt in nigeria here in ghana and elsewhere the earth is being dug up apacethis time not for gold or diamonds only or for bauxite and other mineral riches but also for its rich information about our past its testimony to our achievements and its refutation of the sombre prophets of african history valuable pieces have already been unearthed including evidence of the origin of man in africa we have made our contribution to the fund of human knowledge by extending the frontiers of art culture and spiritual values democracy for instance has always been for us not a matter of a technique but more important than techniquea matter of socialist goals and aims it was however not only our socialist aims that were democratically inspired but also the methods of their pursuit were socialist if we have lost touch with what our forefathers discovered and knew this has been due to the system of education to which we were introduced this system of education prepared us for a subservient role to europe and things european it was directed at estranging us from our own cultures in order the more effectively to serve a new and alien interest in rediscovering and revitalising our cultural and spiritual heritage and values african studies must help to redirect this new endeavour the educational system which we devise today must equip us with the resources of a personality and a force strong enough to meet the intensities of the african presence and situation education must enable us to understand correctly the strains and stresses to which africa is subjected to appreciate objectively the changes taking place and enable us to contribute fully in a truly african spirit for the benefit of all african studies is not a kind of academic hermitage it has warm connections with similar studies in other countries of the world it should change its course from anthropology to sociology for it is the latter which more than any other aspect creates the firmest basis for social policy your meeting here today as africanists from various countries of the world is truly historic it emphasises the idea that knowledge transcends political and national boundaries it is incumbent upon all africanist scholars all over the world to work for a complete emancipation of the mind from all forms of domination control and enslavement a great century has come upon us no race possessing the inherent capacity to survive can resist and remain unaffected by this influence of contact and intercourse the backward with the advanced this influence constitutes the very essence of efficient progress and of civilisation from these heights of the twentieth century i again ask you to cast your eyes south of the desert of sahara if you could go with me to the oppressed congos and ask what does it mean that now for liberty they fight like men and die like martyrs if you would go with me to bachuanaland face their council of headmen and ask what motives caused them recently to decree so emphatically that alcoholic drinks shall not enter their countryvisit their king khama ask for what cause he leaves the gold and ivory palace of his ancestors its mountain strongholds and all its august ceremony to wander daily from village to village through all his kingdom without a guard or any decoration of his ranka preacher of industry and education and an apostle of the new order of things if you would ask menelik what means this that abyssinia is now looking across the oceanoh if you could read the letters that come to us from zululandyou too would be convinced that the elevation of the african race is evidently a part of the new order of things that belongs to this new and powerful period the african already recognizes his anomalous position and desires a change the brighter day is rising upon africa already i seem to see her chains dissolved her desert plains red with harvest her abyssinia and her zululand the seats of science and religion reflecting the glory of the rising sun from the spires of their churches and universities her congo and her gambia whitened with commerce her crowded cities sending forth the hum of business and all her sons employed in advancing the victories of peacegreater and more abiding than the spoils of war yes the regeneration of africa belongs to this new and powerful period by this term regeneration i wish to be understood to mean the entrance into a new life embracing the diverse phases of a higher complex existence the basic factor which assures their regeneration resides in the awakened raceconsciousness this gives them a clear perception of their elemental needs and of their undeveloped powers it therefore must lead them to the attainment of that higher and advanced standard of life the african people although not a strictly homogeneous race possess a common fundamental sentiment which is everywhere manifest crystalizing itself into one common controlling idea conflicts and strife are rapidly disappearing before the fusing force of this enlightened perception of the true intertribal relation which relation should subsist among a people with a common destiny agencies of a social economic and religious advance tell of a new spirit which acting as a leavening ferment shall raise the anxious and aspiring mass to the level of their ancient glory the ancestral greatness the unimpaired genius and the recuperative power of the race its irrepressibility which assures its permanence constitute the africans greatest source of inspiration he has refused to camp forever on the borders of the industrial world having learned that knowledge is power he is educating his children you find them in edinburgh in cambridge and in the great schools of germany these return to their country like arrows to drive darkness from the land i hold that this industrial and educational initiative and his untiring devotion to these activities must be regarded as positive evidences of this process of his regeneration the regeneration of africa means that a new and unique civilization is soon to be added to the world the african is not a proletarian in the world of science and art he has precious creations of his own of ivory of copper and of gold fine plated willowware and weapons of superior workmanship civilization resembles an organic being in its developmentit is born it perishes and it can propagate itself more particularly it resembles a plant it takes root in the teeming earth and when the seeds fall in other soils new varieties sprout up the most essential departure of this new civilization is that it shall be thoroughly spiritual and humanisticindeed a regeneration moral and eternal o africa like some great century plant that shall bloom in ages hence we watch thee in our dream see in thy swamps the prospero of our stream thy doors unlocked where knowledge in her tomb hath lain innumerable years in gloom then shalt thou waking with that morning gleam shine as thy sister lands with equal beam distinguished scholars on behalf of myself and the government and people of ghana it is my great pleasure to welcome you to ghana and to this first africanists conference to be held in africa i wish you every success
the fiery voice of the negro revolt by l m meriwether e must accept the fact w that disaster is one of the terms of living whatever you get you must pay your dues white people expect the negro to pay their the white mans dues they expect the negro to suffer for them be their whipping boy then they are astounded that negroes are not happy in their places and they say my but you are so bitter those were the words spoken by author james baldwin whose latest book the fire next time has entrenched him firmly as the angry young voice of the new negro they were spoken on a california barmstorming tour the yearold novelist and lecturer recently undertook for the congress of racial equality core to raise funds for freedom in the strifetorn south at the university of california in berkeley and los angeles at the university of southern california at rallies in pasadena los angeles and san francisco an unprecedented horde of people turned out to hear this smallboned slender man with the bulging burning eyes speak calmly but with intense feeling on the american dilemma how it came into being and its solution as he saw it the atmosphere inside second baptist church in los angeles which was swollen to the rafters with an interracial crowd clearly reflected the tension and national climate of unrest all week long the newspapers and radios had kept the nation informed of the battle of birmingham and other racial conflicts which flared up in new york chicago and cincinnati speaking in this frame of reference baldwin said in essence the beginning of this country had nothing to do with the myths which have been created about it the words liberty and freedom are entirely misused the people who started this country came here for one reason and one reason only because they thought it would be better here than where they left anybody who was making it in england did not get on the mayflower part of the dilemma of this country is that it has believed the myths it has created in an effort to create the country called america today and escape the past a great many crimes were committed the first thing the settlers did when they touched these shores was to kill the indians not many american children being taught history in our schools get any real sense of how the pioneers really achieved this extermination and then they made a legend out of a massacre today americans present the spectacle of cowboys and indians on tv to reassure ourselves that there really was no crime another thing done in order to conquer the country was to enslave the africans slavery like murder is one of the oldest human institutions in enslaving the african america obtained cheap labor without which it would have had a difficult time in creating its capital the only way these christians who started the country could justify slavery was to say that a slave wasnt a man and therefore no crime was committed that lie is the basis of our current trouble it was the black mans necessity when he got here to accept the situation because he had to survive and outwit his christian masters the crime is not the most important thing what is important is that americans have spent so many generations pretending that it did not happen since society is made by man it can be remade by man but the price for this transformation is high white people will have to ask themselves precisely why they found it necessary to invent a nigger for they invented him out of necessities of their own and every white citizen will have to answer for that and every white citizen will have to realize that he is not innocent of those crimes which are being committed in his name black people will have to do something very hard too which is to love and help the white citizen in his first awkward steps toward maturity but negroes have been functioning in that capacity for a long time they were the first psychiatrists in this country at the conclusion of his speech baldwin who had received two standing ovations before he began was accorded another tumultuous ovation in the question and answer period which followed he stated that the muslim movement came into existence because white america has never kept its promises to its black citizens it is hard for any black person in this country today to arrive at a sense of his own merit he said through the muslim movement a black boy or girl can be invested with pride in being black baldwin however is opposed to the muslims because they do not work in practical areas like instituting a rent strike in harlem he also does not feel that a negro has to create the myth that he is better than white people because he is black he does not have to invent a reason to be proud baldwin said they have endured achieved and triumphed already over one of the crudest oppressions in the history of mankind i think we have every right to be proud that our mothers and fathers carried washing on their heads that they outwitted this civilization to the extent that they took the cross and made it into something which had more meaning than it ever had before they are the only mothers who have produced children who could walk through mobs to go to school i would hate to throw away this real heritage for an invented one another question directed at baldwin asked what the parents of a sevenyearold child should tell the youngster who had just confided that white people were better than negroes baldwin answered that the child was too young to have obtained this impression from the outside world so he must have gotten it in the home the answer is he said for the parents to stop trying to be white over and over he asserted that the negro must strive to become himself to find his own true identity after the rally core demonstrators marched peaceably on city hall in a sympathetic picket for the birmingham cause at a press conference at the biltmore hotel in los angeles baldwins answers to questions of newsmen were so biting that some were visibly shaken in answer to a query as to what it is that the negro wants baldwin answered heatedly no grown person has a right to ask what does a negro want you know what you want then you know what i want what does any man want i am a man discrimination against negroes he told the reporters is the central factor in american life and everything that happens here refers back to that there is no way to exaggerate the racial problem what i tell you is minuscule a microscopic bit of what the situation really is it is very grave i want the country to cease pretending that im not a part of it in defense of his claim that conditions are just as bad in the north as in the south baldwin said the negroes dont walk down the same streets as nonnegroes you may think that the courts are the same arrests are the same getting insurance is the same but it isnt asked about violence baldwin stated that whether or not there is violence depends upon the whites the negro is just a simple human being theyre not angels i dont know how much they can stand speaking to a predominantly negro audience at a luncheon sponsored by the men of tomorrow in los angeles baldwin said in essence that the negro people spend a vast amount of energy in escaping from their past from the auction block from the white mans kitchen i ran a long way before i realized that my ancestry was all i had that would help me through this world baldwin told his audience that if one embraces the past its tyrannical power ends it no longer possesses you you then possess it the negro has a tremendous debt to pay to his ancestors and the only way to pay it is to be responsible to ones contemporaries and those who come after him he said part of this responsibility is to find out ones true identity he added that many negroes in the north are completely demoralized by the age of and become hopelessly bitter they are bitter because they have been so despised no nation can afford to misuse onetenth of its natural resources baldwin added part of our responsibility the responsibility of the socalled intellectuals is to create the opportunity for these demoralized individuals to take their future into their own hands to know that a black man can be and become anything that he wishes to become baldwin calls for a total embrace between blacks and whites in order to avoid a costly conflagration this total embrace he insists must be based on mutual love and respect and upon the true history of the negros role in america and not upon myth baldwins intensity comes from the fact that he reacts emotionally to every crisis quivers at every outrage in his own words i am naked and pregnant with some strange monster although physically exhausted after his los angeles stint which also included numerous appearances at cocktail parties in beverly hills and sherman oaks where he was bombarded with questions he returned to san francisco to make a twohour documentary film which will be released later this year author of three novels the latest called another country and two other books of essays nobody knows my name and notes of a native son baldwin has been criticized by some as being too bitter and of overlooking the many gains the negro has made the oldest of nine children baldwin is the product of the ghettoes of new york an environment he despised and ran away from to europe after a tenyear exile in paris baldwin returned to the united states in with the realization that his roots were here he insists that he loves america and that is why he is angry but no longer bitter at the same time baldwin was speaking in california the united presbyterians were holding their th general assembly in des moines iowa dr marshall l scott retiring titular head criticized his constituents for moving too slow on the race issue the crux of americas racial problem he said is found in the type of neighborhoods where presbyterianism flourish it is exactly in those communities where there is the loudest talk about freedom and the most shouting about communism that the very fundamentals of our constitutional system and our biblical faith are most vigorously violated dr scott said that there is no more racial discrimination in alabama than in hundreds of allwhite communities in the north and west until our allwhite suburban communities deliberately seek to break the walls of separation that now prevail the damnedup flow of negroes from the agricultural south to the industrial north and west will pile up to sicken and possibly destroy us while other militant voices throughout the country were digesting baldwins views favorably and otherwise still others were labeling the negro movement a peoples revolution whether one agrees completely with baldwins statements or not one cannot deny that his written and spoken words are searing and penetrating if he is not the voice of this peoples revolution then he is at least a disquieting echo estevanico and the cities of gold by florence laughlin stevanico they e called hima familiar and affectionate term in the spanish language meaning little steve not because he was small in stature but because he was a giant of a man handsome intelligent and admired for his courage his origin is not known exactly some historians refer to him simply as a negro others insist that he was a moor born in azamor on the coast of morocco one thing is certain however he was a slave to one of the conquistadors and his story comes down to us as one of the most fascinating chronicles of the earliest days of exploration in our own southwest it begins almost four and a half centuries ago when estevanico sailed to the new world with the expedition of panfilo or pamphilio de narvaez in june of to search for gold and to colonize florida for the king of spain reaching the coast of florida the veteran explorer divided his forces he sent his five ships and men south toward mexico while he and the remaining together with the horses set off across the trackless jungles of florida it was a disastrous venture they met with hunger disease and the arrows or hostile indians and were forced at last to eat the flesh of their horses some managed to escape by building crude barges and sailing across the gulf of mexico but even these were shipwrecked off the coast of texas and finally of the only four remained alive and those four had the sad fate to be taken as slaves by the indians besides estevanico there were three spaniardsandres dorantes castillode maldonado and alvar nunezbetter known in history by his odd title of cabeza de vaca which means head of a cow it is cabeza de vaca in his famous book the shipwrecked ones who has given us this part of estevanicos story and a fantastic story it is little steve and his companions were undoubtedly the first explorers from the old world to cross continental united states and what amazes us in the jetage is that it took them over seven years to go from ocean to ocean after spending several months in cruel bondage to the indians in texas they managed to escape and struck westward roaming through the wilderness they traveled through new mexico into arizona and possibly reached california and in alien country they were all equal for they had only their wit and re sourcefulness to protect them from danger many of the indian tribes were friendly they thought the strangers were superior beings or gods and gave them food and gifts and the four wanderers including estevanico became known as healers wherever the spaniards went in the new world they carried the cross and tried to christianize the natives now with prayer and with what knowledge they had of medicine and possibly with a bit of mumbojumbo thrown in they healed the sick and even according to cabeza de vaca performed the miracle of bringing a chief who seemed to be dead back to life their fame spread westward and as they traveled on they were joined by innocent and friendly indians who followed adoring and laughing behind them observant young estevanico learned from the indians too he learned their languages and their customs he ate new foodsjerked deer strange roots and the sweet red fruit called tuna from the desert cactus he saw animals such as he had never dreamed of the small opossum with its curious pouch for carrying its young the great shaggy buffalo which had never before been seen by the spanish and often around the campfires he heard the exciting and wonderful tales of the seven cities of cibolathe golden cities to the north which were to play such an important part in his life and in the long history of new spain many a night estevanico must have lain awake looking up at the golden stars wondering if he would ever see the seven cities the indians had said that they were rich beyond description with great houses with many rooms and gleaming with gold to the indians turquoise stones blue as the desert sky were sacred and valuable but they knew that the spaniards preferred gold finally the little party with its happy band of followers turned south into what is now mexico and at last after seven long weary years of wandering they were united with other men from spain at the city of culiacan on the west coast it must have been a moving incident and would have been a joyous one if it had not been marred by spanish greed when some of the spaniards in port saw the friendly group of indians they decided to capture them and sell them into slavery cabeza de vaca begged for the freedom of the indians he was naturally kind and had had personal experience with oppression when he was in bondage to the indians and estevanico must have felt bitterness but regardless of protests many of the indians were taken into slavery here our three spaniards leave our story but estevanico stays with us for his greatest adventure is still ahead first he was send to mexico city to serve the viceroy there but he never forgot his adventures in the land to the north and his dream of seeing the golden cities and when the viceroy decided to send an expedition in search of the fabled cities estevanico was chosen to go along with him was a franciscan missionary father marcos de niza and a group of indian guides now it was a long way from mexico city to the seven cities of cibolaprobably close to two thousand miles and when father marco de niza reached the town of bacapa near what is now tucson arizona he decided to rest awhile but having confidence in estevanicos intelligence and experience he sent the big man on ahead with the guides telling him to send back a wooden cross if he found the trip worthwhile little steve was proud to go on ahead he was loved by the indians and made quite an impression as he proceeded farther to the north he was dressed in fine clothes and carried a staff decorated with bright feathers and dry gourds which rattled as he walked he planted crosses to mark the way for the missionary and sent back glowing reports about the riches ahead perhaps he became overconfident and because the pueblo indians in the valley were friendly estevanico became too bold north he went in arizona and east into the mountains and finally reached new mexico and at last he came to what historians now think was one of the fabled seven cities it was one of the seven villages of the zuni indians it was walled it had houses of many rooms but it was squalid and drab and dusty and the zunis eyed the approaching travelers with distrust and suspicion no explorer had ever reached their territory and they had probably never seen a dark giant of a man like estevanico he had grown too accustomed to friendly natives foolishly but bravely he entered the village he was taken prisoner almost at once and the next day estevanico was killeda martyr to the spanish hunger for gold he was the first explorer to penetrate into the wild region of the zuni and the first to reach one of the cities of cibola he found no gold but he was not the last to search for it the franciscan marcos de niza went back to mexico and told glowing lies about the richness of the fabulous cities coronado and de soto both searched for them and to this day you can hear exciting tales of the lost cities here in the west though his last adventure ended in failure this does not detract from the glory of this remarkable and fearless man mr j george hilzinger writing in a book called treasureland published in has this to say he was an honor to his race and the negro citizens of this republic should perpetuate his memory and we suggest a monument in central park new york george altman by a s doc young yearold tall l it neat two hundred pound gentleman who epitomizes a new breed among negro athletes a graduate of tennessee state a i university in nashville he is a member of the everincreasing clan of collegiates who have populated baseball since world war ii he islike the mantles musials and nicklausesa capitalist as the great manager casey stengel once remarked about his new york yankees it is impossible to contain george in a single frame of reference it takes two at least in frameofreference no the sporting news is his bible bat ball and glove are his tools major league talent is his stockintrade which brings him an estimated a year in frameofreference no the wall street journal is his bible dowjones averages are his tools investments are the product he sells unlike legions of his predecessors of infinite racial constitution george is a trailblazer for the new breed of negro athlete who prepares for his postathletic days by firming a foundation in a reputable profession while he yet wields a big stick and holds a hot hand with the fans george is in a sense as creditable a pioneer as columbus or daniel boone he is the first active negro major league baseball player to become a registered stock broker a rarefied orbit which he reached a few months ago when he passed a rigid examination administered by the new york stock exchange long before his playing days are over george will be entrenched in the stock brokerage business and if his ambitions dont play tricks on him at the conclusion of his baseball career he will slide into the intriguing world of tickertape multibilliondollar transactions and american mainstream operations without missing a baton or losing a nickel from early spring until late summer for the next eight or nine years george altman will concentrate most of his time and attention on an athletic career which has begun to assume spectacular proportions for the past two seasons he has been the leading hitter among the chicago cubs a versatile star capable of playing both outfield and infield on defense during the past offseason george was traded to the st louis cardinals whose frontoffice leaders expect him to contribute substantially to their national league pennant pursuits during the major league baseball season george will also devote his available spare time to the practice of his second profession stock brokerage he will seek prospects among all athletes whore interested in converting their sports salaries into profitable nesteggs but he will concentrate his immediate efforts on the frank robinsons willie mayses ernie bankses bill whites and hank aarons who earn more than a halfmillion dollars annually in the frontline ranks of negro stars perhaps twice that much more in the lower echelons in early fall henceforth after the world series has been committed to history and the archives of the hot stove leagues george will pack away his spiked shoes and uniform his bat and glove assume the conservative attire commonly associated with wall and lasalle streets and attempt to bat or better in the world of high finance lets backtrack to the past winter lets say you want to see george in this new world of his you enter chicagos financial district on lasalle street you search for no south and you enter the lobby of the massive building there you scan the directory of offices under as you find the name and the office number george altman you take an elevator to the eighth floor you arrive at the offices of golkin divine and fishman a stock brokerage firm which holds membership in the new york stock exchange the american stock exchange and the midwest stock exchange you enter this office and a courteous receptionist asks whom do you wish to see you say george altman please the receptionist places a call and in a matter of moments she says hell be with you in a minute you say thank you you wait meanwhile a mere glance reveals a sizeable main office of some two dozen desks manned by busy salesman many of them contributing to the general welfare of the american telephone and telegraph company or one of its affiliates in a minute as the lady promised your attention is attracted by the figure of a tall good looking neatlydressed brownskin man who is approaching you with a welcoming smile on his face a warm hand outstretched you take the hand its a strong one you are cordially invited to come in and take a seat on the other side of stock broker george altmans desk a blackboard with dowjones figures is overhead to his left an electronic board that flashes pertinent stock news throughout the day as long as the new york stock exchange remains opens is within easy view dead ahead of him the wall street journal is conspicuous in its presence on his desk as is a complicated telephone mechanism which appears to be a private switchboard this is about as far from base hits as a man can get this is big business millions of dollars in daily exchange this is the pulse of the american economy and george altman is more than an infinitesimal part of it the interview begins a rare story unfolds george altman says that if he had his college life to live over he would major not in physical education and minor in biology he would major in finance and economics he discloses that he had been interested in stocks and bonds for some time prior to joining the firm of golkin divine fishman after talking to some of my teammates he says i felt that there was a need for a competent financial person in the business pro sports whom the fellows could trust at the time of his conversation with teammates george was living in a south side chicago hotel he mentioned his ideas to a hotel executive named carl marks marks introduced him to an officer of golkin divine fishman this firm agreed to take him on as a trainee george spent three months in training following the major league baseball season he put in another three months following the season in december he was ready for the new york stock exchange examination which he passed with flying colors achieving the rank of registered stock broker during his training period george earned nothing or next to nothing from stock sales he estimates that it will take five six or seven years for him to establish himself as a stock broker to the extent that he can anticipate full livelihood from this industry but he admits i feel that im a little better off than the average salesman because im not presently depending on the commission business for my livelihood therefore im better able to put the customers welfare in front i dont have to worry about pressure selling im here to provide a service in these years between now and retirement from baseball im looking to build up a clientele a very good relationship with the people despite his affiliation with sports george altman does not plan to limit his sales pitches to the baseball fraternity i will not sell to a specialized group my service is available to all however i would like to think that i would be able to help the athletes as a group a projection reveals that if george sells to none but athletes to none but negro athletes say hell be dealing in big money working in a field of fertility the top negro major league baseball players alone earned more than in a halfdozen championship fighters such as joe louis sugar ray robinson henry armstrong ezzard charles floyd patterson and archie moore grossed well over million if george altman merely captures the negroathlete market he is in clover with the aid of special correspondence courses other diligent study and research george has become an expert on his industry this is he says a business of integrity actually many millions of dollars change hands every day without any physical handling through word of mouth through agreement the business keeps you abreast of whats happening all over the world as well as right around you everything that is of importance reflects itself in the stock market it gives you a sense of responsibility also a sense of participation in the american system of free enterprise i believe that if more of us negroes would invest in these companies those represented on stock exchanges we would have more to say about hiring and firing as part owners it goes back to the whole thing of racial equalitywe havent been participating fully there are many financial advantages to be derived from investments in stocks and bonds you can use your stocks as collateral for a loan they give you a good return on your money plus there is the allimportant factor of capital appreciation there are also taxexempt securities for substantial income earners there are all types of securities for all types of people our job is to fit the security to the person this industry is stringently regulated by both the new york stock exchange and the federal government when george is a stock broker not a baseball player he works hours a day his to day coincides with the activities of the stock market itself after that he must study research seek clients daily any time youre in the company of a person he says hes a potential prospect he adds you have to stay alert to current events things that are happeningin other words you have to try to stay on top of the news theres a lot of anticipation you have to do this entails a lot of reading and assimilating of news in his private life george altman is deeply interested in youth work he is a member of the board of directors of a chicago youth organization he is a humane person who though he would welcome riches from the stock brokerage business is a sportsman in the business as well as he is in baseball there is a fine sense of fair play of sportsmanship as well as competitiveness to be found in his carry over of attitudes and abilities from baseball to the stock market a good salesman he says is one who puts the customers interests firstalways george himself knows how embarrassing a bad investment can become with a group of ballplayers he invested in what appeared to be a lucrative chicago real estate deal a salesman approached him as he did other stars with a fancy brochure showing prime investment properties when the deal went down the ballplayers were stuck in a slum situation which cost or more of them bad publicity as well as financial losses george was one of the few who thanks to his thenlaymans interest in investments sensed that something was wrong and pulled out cash intact the fellows george says speaking of the participating ballplayers didnt know what they were getting into the man showed us a brochure i learned then that theres no substitute for investigation i tell that to all my clients you should know the situationand things that affect the situation on the subject of direct carryover between sports and the selling of stocks and bonds george said theres a definite carryover here in the stock brokerage business you have tough times you have a drought as when the market is in a down trend and people are reluctant to get into the market you might have a good solid

story that a major new york high fashion house had hired its first negro model the news stirred only a minor ripple in fashionconscious circles while the event did mark another breech in the crumbling wall of racial exclusion its impact was largely anticlimactic for the past five years followers of trends in haute couture had been watching beautiful negro girls modeling clothes by worldfamous designers all across the united states thanks to the ebony fashion fair which annually tours some cities with fabulous designs from the salons of such stylesetters as dior givenchy fontana and lanvin the image of negro women in high fashion settings was already well established needless to say the wire services had not bothered to take note back in when freda deknight then home service director of the johnson publishing company organized the first ebony fashion fair after talking her boss publisher john h johnson into supporting the idea mrs deknight set to work selecting and training models lining up local sponsors and planning an itinerary then with the confidence and determination that was characteristic of her she flew off to paris and rome for an unprecedented invasion of the ramparts of haute couture she returned in triumph with a collection of some of the most dazzling designs in europeand with a bill for her boss the ebony fashion fair is now a national institution and negro models long ago ceased to be elegant creatures of curiosity but last january the dynamic woman who had done so much to unite high fashion and negro women in the eyes and minds of the world finally surrendered to the disease against which she had been bravely struggling for years in her new york apartment where until coma claimed hershe had doggedly made plans for the ebony fashion fair freda deknight died of cancer in death the wire services at last paid homage to mrs deknight in a united press international obituary story that was published by most of the major newspapers reference was made to her contributions to the worlds of food and fashion the fact that upi mentioned her at all was testimony to her stature but the details of her truly fabulous story remained untold that story began oddly enough on a train near topeka kansas one december morning in her mother elenore alexander a traveling nurse lost her race against the stork and freda was born in transit only two years later fredas father frederick alexander a steward on the santa fe railroad died and early in her childhood freda alexander and her older sister went to live with the paul scott family in mitchell south dakota the scotts were caterers as well as farmers and they encouraged young freda in her interest in food and food preparation it was an interest which later would lead to some precedentmaking activities in the young ladys career in the years that followed freda alexander lived with a number of families in such widely separated places as mason city iowa st paul minnesota and salem south dakota in the latter town she attended school in a convent an experience which profoundly influenced her religious outlook throughout life from this school she went on to south dakota wesleyan college from which she received a degree in home economics thus prepared she launched a series of elaborate food demonstrations in the midwest traveling to new york she further prepared herself in her field by enrolling in courses at both columbia and new york universities for a time she taught sewing and served as a guidance counselor for yorkville high school and other vocational training schools in manhattan then she met and married rene deknight arranger and pianist for the delta rhythm boys it was in a year after ebony magazine was founded by publisher johnson that freda deknight joined the staff as food columnist a job that eventually led to the position as home service director for the johnson publishing company as mrs deknight liked to tell the story deliberately embellished it went something like this while visiting in chicago enroute to los angeles she was invited to dinner at the home of a wealthy couple who were longtime friends of hers shortly before the dinner hour the hosts learned that their caterer had broken a leg in an accident freda soothed her frantic hosts assured them that she would take care of everything in short order and promptly proceeded to do so sparing no expense she bought the ingredients and prepared a meal fit for royalty as fate would have it one of the dinner guests was young publisher john h johnson so impressed was he with the food that he asked mrs deknight to give him the menu hurrying off to catch her train she promised to send the menu back by mail when the menu arrived it was done in an exciting narrative style that made it seem like fun to cook publisher johnson was delighted he offered mrs deknight a job writing a regular food column for ebony and she readily accepted the feature was christened a date with a dish by mrs deknights husband and a new career was born as a date with a dish grew in popularity mrs deknights identification with johnson publishing company became more emphatic she moved to chicago and in due time expanded her influence to the fashion end of ebony magazines features two years after joining the company she collected several hundreds of her recipes and those of negro celebritiesinto a book called a date with a dish a roguish little brown chef became her trademark the book became a national bestseller from food and fashion editor freda deknight graduated to the position created for her of home service director when the johnson publishing company home offices were remodeled and expanded in the third floor became her exclusive domain she supervised the planning and preparation of fullcourse daily meals for some employes in the company cafeteria presided over the first ultramodern test kitchen in a negro publishing firm and coordinated the selection and photographing of clothes and models for all ebony features on fashion during this period mrs deknight scored a record number of firsts for a negro woman in various food and fashion organizations appeared frequently on television to demonstrate such exotic recipes as violetpetal cake and rosepetal pudding and became a familiar figure at professional food and fashion gatherings where negroes had been seen before only as servants in the course of directing and organizing fashion features mrs deknight had scouted the country for fresh young faces with the kind of figures suited for modeling one of her best known discoveries was diahann carroll whose lithe form graced many pages in ebony magazine before she became a broadway and hollywood star another discovery was cordie king the beauteous chicago girl who mrs deknight helped to groom for fashion shows prior to the advent of the ebony fashion fairs it was during the height of the national popularity of the ebony fashion fairs that freda deknight learned she had cancer in she underwent dramatic surgery in new york only days it seemed after she was discharged from the hospital she was on a plane bound for paris and the spring showings of haute couture she arrived in a wheelchair a medium of locomotion she was to use increasingly in the months that followed last year accompanied by her husband who had left the delta rhythm boys to remain constantly at her side mrs deknight flew to hawaii and then on to japan to select clothing for the show the fashion fair with an oriental flair it was the first year she was too weak to force herself to travel with the show but she kept in close touch through occasional visits to nearby cities and via phone chats with the staff early in the winter it became evident that the disease which had ravaged her once vigorous frame and which long ago would have killed a less valiant woman finally had left mrs deknight with little strength to fight said one friend who had witnessed the amazing battle without the fashion fair to worry about freda would have gone long ago and until consciousness abandoned her she did indeed plan for the upcoming fashion fair because there were so many high points in freda deknights life it is easy to overlook the low but she liked to overlook them herself she grew up almost an orphan and she worked hard and long for success and she seldom received in equal measure what she always generously gave she was often ill even before the long siege with cancer and she had known agonizing poverty but the legacies of her life are many and farreaching and one can find satisfaction in her many achievements even as one regrets her passing in a catholic digest article by margy wyvill ecclesine freda fashions and faith which appeared a few weeks before mrs deknight died it is pointed out that the ebony fashion fair is the biggest traveling fashion show in the world it might also be pointed out that a date with a dish which was published in a new edition several months before she died also is the first major cookbook by a negro however freda deknight did not rest on laurels nor did she take the time to bask in praise her energy and imagination were always directed toward the creation of something new and worthwhile her sights were set on fresh frontiers she was a titan of a lady a rare and wonderful human being integration or black nationalism by richard thorne etween civil_rights and black nationalism the two main approaches to the solution of the black americans problems at this time i would definitely say that black nationalism has the better arguments ill state why i say this but first let me clarify my contention i dont mean to say that the civil righters are all wrong and that they are in no way helping to better the black mans conditions in america such would be an exaggeration following the premise that civil righters base their program on their conclusions are valid and sound they regard the conditions of the black american as being mainly deprived of certain basic human and constitutional rights for example they say that a particular black man is penniless because he is unemployed and he is unemployed because his particular race is discriminated against on the basis of color the solution there fore is to press for fair employment rights which will allow him an equal opportunity to be employed and he thus wont have to be penniless the logic here is incontestable no one would reasonably argue with it also since recent pressurings for civil_rights have accomplished some headway in this direction it follows also that some degree of good has been done some blacks who didnt formerly have jobs now have them what then is the basis of my contention obviously it is elsewhere let us therefore look elsewhere to find it in the first place the civil righters concentrated as they are in their one specific approach ignore it seems too vast an area of the overall spectrum of sociology and the dynamics of race relations in fact because of the peculiar orientation of a civil righters thinking it is i believe quite necessary for him to ignore more than he considers i will illustrate but first looking just at the term civil_rights itself implying by definition its own objective will already give a clue as to my meaning what actually is the civil righters objective obviously it is the acquisition of those lawful rights denied him for him it is essential that he has great and uncompromising faith in the letter and the spirit of the law the u s constitution what he should be as a human being and as a dutiful american citizen and what all races in america should be is without question already spelled out for him nothing is omitted he shall not depart therefrom equally essential he must believe that the constitution at its face value is nonracial that is it doesnt cater to any one race more than the other but equally embraces all citizens white or black jew or chinese the constitution therefore becomes a nonpartial representative of the rights of all americansindeed more becomes the alpha and omega of political and social ethics of humankind itself and in it is found the future dignity and respect of the whole world incorporated in and symbolized by america now to what extent the civil righter believes this of course varies with the individual but something or another like this is believed by all of them often one will say when confronted by a black nationalist i am not just for one race i am for humanity meaning of course he is for the ideals of the constitution in thus believing the civil righter feels he stands for the freedom of all men and therefore he exalts himself in his own mind above the petty racial dissensions and nationalistic squabbles of racists he further feels that in order to solve americas racial problems it is only necessary to make whites and blacks alike see this point strong though this argument may sound it is actually very weak for again as has already been suggested it misses more than it considers in so far as the constitution might be limited and not include all the best interests of black people so the civil righter in not questioning it is also limited is the constitution then limited is it equally for the interests of all americans or does it promote the white race more than any other these are questions which must be answered if black peoples quest for dignity and freedom is to be attained let us look closer to answer them how may we do this one way i have found is to consider the premises upon which the black nationalists base their contentions in other words since my argument is that black nationalism in its outlook includes more in scope than does civil righters in theirs we need only look at those areas which black nationalism includes and which civil righters dont for example taking in a broader sociological spectrum the black nationalists feel that the white man ie the western world is embarked consciously or otherwise upon a mission to assert himself as the master and superior race of humankind he does this through various means sometimes in ways more outright and flagrant than others but always however through the bold assertion of his culture and himself along with his own physical self image upon the whole world to the extent that many nonwhite people it is pre sumed have been made to even think of god or any possible visitors from other planets as being more likely white than black what this means is that the white world in asserting itself has defined human valuesstandards of art and beauty etcand everything that men now consider of value including the terms civilization and culture themselves almost everything the world now holds dear corresponds to the white world at this point one might say so what what difference does it make which race defines human values someone has to do it why not the white race such questions however are very naive and fail to see a great many things to answer them we need only look at history which has through the process of the white race defining all human values worked out quite a bit more advantageously for the white race as a whole than it has for the darker races what happens is that when blacks born and unborn turn to the history books to see what great things their forefathers performed they find that most of the worlds great and laudable deeds were performed by the white race with very little contributed by other races and virtually nothing contributed by their own what effects this will and does have on shaping their attitudes toward the white race and their attitudes toward themselves as well as their outlooks in general are no insignificant matter it is at the core of race relations it is no doubt the very basis for both racial and individual initiative and will largely determine the direction in which initiative is taken civil righters if they are sincere in their efforts to help relieve the oppression blacks are under would do well to consider this point i have heard various misinformed americans from both races say at this point history is what it is we cant change the fact that the white race has made all of the worlds most noteworthy contributions if the black race hasnt done anything of merit it just hasnt thats all there is to it the appalling ignorance of such a remark always saddens me at the same time making me ever more suspicious of what motives the white world must have had while writing world history not writing it accurately yet when one does study history and finds how it has been written by whites in fact not quite so accurately at least it is more understandable how one could hold so mistaken a notion as the above also one might see why the person so believing could be so stubbornly committed to only the ideals of the western world yet never let it seriously be supposed that the black race is so unindustrious and uncreative as white history has made him out to be the only problem is that most of black history has lain in obscurity unknown to most blacks and whites alike it is always interesting to watch the eyes of a person formerly ignorant of black history light up when the startling wonders of africas past civilizationsthe songhay the mali the tanganyika the zimbabwe kingdoms etcare told africans of the past were always represented as being barbarians and savages semimonkeys as it were eating the flesh of other humans almost raw unclothed and with no concepts of morality fortunately however black nationalism realizing that such are but myths and distortions is promulgating the true history of africa and its people for the black nationalist now knows that history however it is written is that which largely gives a people their image of themselves and if their history is conspicuously absent in merit or superior for that matter their image of themselves will be likewise if now world history and particularly american history rather than being a chronicle of the poor race relations it has been had been a history of the equal struggles of all peoples to found a world society based on understanding and brotherhood the case for civil_rights alone would be a much firmer structure but being as it has the oppositethe chronicle of the western worlds land thefts murders and kidnappings enslavings and exploitations and in short hatred for and tyranny over the black raceit makes far less good sense for blacks to so dogmatically pursue only their civil_rights as if such were the sine qua non of any future hope they might have what they would be better busily doing besides anything else they might be doing is building themselves a surer historical foundation of their own not merely as whites would define it for them but according to their own cranial capacities to imagine what a partially black world should be like least of all should they continue to think of culture and civilization as the sum assertion of the white race only but rather as the aggregate cultures of the whole world and all races blacks should ask themselves where are their musical giants their bards of poetry and literature their sculptural and architectural contributions to the world where are their history books and their great men of renown if some day races are truly to be equal what kind of foundation ought they to be laying right now as blacks have tended to ignore these questions whites left to their own ways have come to conceive of themselves as so to speak the master builders of the world and blacks having observed no other world but that which whites have created have been more or less content to let it be that way at this point i am often led to think of the parable of the talents i recall that those servants who multiplied their talents were further rewarded while that one who buried his was reprimanded and relieved of that talent he had which servant could the black race best represent the black nationalists for good reason i think seem to feel that there are ample evidences that the white world asserts itself in the manner already stated also they feel the evidences are numerous enough to disclose which race benefits the most by it there may be some question however concerning whether all whites past and present actually advance their own race out of a conscious effort to do so and with malicious intent toward darker peoples many avid black nationalists seem to feel that they do i personally would not agree with this point of view i would say rather that the way th present racial patterns are structured circumstances will automatically work out to the advantage of the white race and to the disadvantage of the darker races i do not mean that at no time have whites consciously promoted themselves and consciously done dark peoples harm stealing land from the indians was im sure a conscious effort to do good to themselves and to do harm to the indians also the robbery of africa might have been likewise but the white of today the one who gives money to negro charity or goes on the freedom ride or secretly hopes for the end of discrimination gradual though it may be and though he himself may do precious little to help bring it about but who is sure in his own mind that he wishes blacks no harm is usually quite unaware that he is promoting values which compliment only the white race he perhaps never thinks of the constitution as being a unique and exclusive achievement of the civilization of the west he too thinks of it as being a document of universal ethics promoting the human race and hence he himself in believing in it is for humanity while he is usually quite willing to integrate his fellow black american he takes it for granted that such integration will always be inward toward the white society which is so to speak a sort of center of gravity for all better race relations he never conceives of himself moving outward toward the black society naturally he also assumes that the black in order to be worthy or acceptable will continue to polish his behavior according to the prevailing standards of the society which of course just happen to be white standards although this white does not actually hate blacks he firmly feels that manners indigenous to blacks are only at best a subculture interesting in a fashion but overall culturally below and inferior to the more desirable culture of the white society to him black nationalism especially poses a threat to the stable and sovereign world which he has come to envision as the best of all possible worlds any black who talks of recovering his peopies lost heritage and giving his allegiance to it rather than to the white world is regarded with suspicion and trepidation and literally shatters the stereotyped image of the humble and peaceloving negro he was once so familiar with such an unaccountable negro must be abnormally bitter to hold such an extremist position and if allowed to promote his aims he will undoubtedly revenge himself upon first opportunity on the whole white race indiscriminate of individuals like himself who sincerely wish blacks no harm and will thrust the whole world into violence and destruction ending forever the beautiful race relations which were in the making at the this time now of course the above may be an exaggeration but any white actually believing anything like this is just being ridiculous i would think he is psychologically and unnecessarily punishing himself for his races bloodridden conscience and crimes against the black race if any violence is at all forthcoming it is such guilt projection on the part of whites manifesting itself in imagined counteraggressive attempts to thwart black nationalism or black supremacy as such a one is wont to regard it that will precipitate it if however this white is sincere and would avert violence rather than try to physically thwart black nationalism he would try to understand it using the more commendable achievements of his own race as a clue to the aims of the black nationalists he would also stand peacefully aside mustering in his own heart all the good will possible and allow black nationalism to begin elevating the black race to a cultural status that might allow both races to proceed on a more equal footing and start building the world into a more brotherly healthy and fearless environment to live in this i say is what whites should do though i venture to say they will not for though many of them have a degree of good will toward blacks it is not that good my prediction is that the white man and the black man alike will for the most part continue to decry black nationalism both conceiving of it fearfully the former as a threat to his own culture which is being looked upon as not being good enough and the latter as some awful new social catalysis stirring up the resentments of whites and thus limiting his own chances of finally being included into the white world now if anything i have said thus far is valid the great irony of course which the civil righters have missed is that the very act of heaping laurels on the constitution only further glorifies the white world which penned it the question should be asked must the whole world come to look on the social and political ethics of the western world as being the hallmark of civilized achievement it is here that civil righters will say but are we not also americans we have been here away from africa over three hundred years what other law or ethics could we normally have these questions again are valid the main issue is in what spirit are they asked are they asked out of an earnest desire to promote the best interests of black people or are they not rather asked out of a stubborn psychological predilection for western mores and a deep ingrained aversion to all mental identification with africa and africans as when one too closely empathizes only with western culture one definite approach to answering these questions might be to isolate each question and ponder it individually for example the black civil righter might ask himself in what sense is he an american how much does black culture here in america actually have in common with black cultures in africa and the world over he should study to find out i believe that if such questions were asked and earnestly answered the civil righter would perhaps feel a greater kinship to his people in america and to blacks everywhere nor would he feel so wounded and mortally insulted when the constitution is questioned he would find it unnecessary to be quite so vitriolic toward those blacks who are in the attempted process of building a selfimage which they themselves might respect as equal to that of any other people on the earth if civil righters were willing to grant this much pressure im sure would be relieved from the black nationalists which would in turn permit them to be less extreme and radical in their approach for example black nationalists have in the past insisted that every person with black skin possesses some racial quality or essence called soul which by implication has been made out to be superior to that which whites correspondingly have yet im sure the expounders of black soul actually know that what they refer to is more cultural than racial indigenous to the psychology that mutual suffering and common environment and ancestry have created civil righters in attacking what they gladly perceive as a fallacy or loophole in the black nationalists doctrine only succeed again in missing the whole point black nationalists have i will admit expounded a rather mysticsounding virtue called soul but their attempt in doing this was never meant to imply racial superiority but was rather intended to advance that one characteristic besides color which all blacks have in common this was in response to the common cry of many blacks trying to desert the race we dont have anything in common with them for even those seeking escape the black nationalists realized were still wont to think of themselves as inheritors also of that peculiar cultural gift known as soul now if the black nationalists have not succeeded in their aim to unite the race in america it might only partially be their fault in the way they have presented themselves but the greatest failure must i believe be imputed to those who had no desire to unite with blacks they would have most likely rejected black nationalism no matter how it was presented other than the tendencies of some black nationalists to exaggerate black virtues black nationalists have on the whole essentially attempted to do much the same kind of things every other race has done to prosper the emphasis they put on racial virtues are incidental to the circumstances they find themselves in at this time without such emphasis how else might they turn the eyes of the world to regard their race which in esteem and importance time and history have all but forgotten the black nationalist is merely saying in the only way left him peoples of the world history time do not forget me i am here also significantly a part of the world if world values are being defined i insist that i be allowed to provide a part of that definition the irony of blacks saying this is admittedly very subtle and turns many of the race away from black nationalism for if blacks say that they want to help define world values they must by definition be black nationalists that is racistic and foras it is calledblack supremacy while to be for the constitution or some such embodiment of western ideals or mores which inadvertently promote the white race is to be for humanity having ourselves been reared in the western world the social implication of this is not always easy to see or is too foreign a way of thinking to risk now that we seem to be so rapidly nearing our solongsoughtafter goals this kind of thinking more prudent than courageous is understandable in view of how long blacks have suffered and waited civil righters are here embued with an old commonly held philosophy of many american blacks that of a bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush meaning of course that civil_rights relatively in the hand are more assured than some imaginary world of the future with equal portions of all ethnic cultures in the bush but if civil righters actually feel that what they seek is more in the hand than that which black nationalists seek perhaps we may benefit by looking at it in still another way civil righters have said and i imagine felt that much of the discrimination against blacks in america stems from institutions and mores that are themselves prejudiced they say that prejudiced institutions create prejudiced mores and thus a cycle is begun and passed along to following generations what they then would do is rid america of all prejudiced institutions set up institutions that are fair to all and thus break the cycle and spare future generations these prejudiced mores although the hope is truly beautiful will this ever happen black nationalists say no an ideal they say is one thing the practice quite another what about this supposed paradise of race relations who will define it whites naturally everyone knows its not going to be defined by blacks what this means then is that all changing and molding of character to fit the social norm will be black people reshaping their own to suit the white world let us not talk about capitalism and the need for a cheap labor market but just out of curiosity what will happen to those blacks in that segment of the population which for economical or social reasons or other never quite successfully make the change from a black personality to a white will they still be persecuted will they still be the social scapegoat will they still be denied equal privileges what will happen to them or doesnt it matter will they be kept waiting will they be the black civil righters of tomorrow i will not ask whether whites will ever do any changing to suit blacks of course they wont they are already wellsuited by virtue of being white they will continue to define dress speech mannerisms hair styles the way one walks be especially sure blacks you lose that despicable hep limp that particularly characterizes the beebop or the hoodlum whites dont like it indeed all modes of human behavior whites will define who else what about history you say it too will be written by them and about them oh i see well now civil righter in that case im beginning to suspect that this paradise of future race relations might not be such a paradise after all but will be the same old america of racial snobbery and airs of superiority only now more subtle than ever and more inveterate because it went so long unchallenged and therefore harder to eradicate george washington then crossing the delaware will still be magnified in importance whereas the slave revolt of gabriel will all but be kept secret gettysburg of course will still be known but nat turner will be forgotten every american man woman and child black and white will say in unison our forefathers died there no one will say nor dare say of virginia and the slave revolt of our forefathers also died there alas not americans but only negroes died there and negroes have since been forgotten now of course the above is an exaggeration but something like this is obviously in the making so bent upon obscuring their own self image are blacks and so internally driven toward acceptance into the white world awaken civil righters in terms of racial dignity and self images these matters are far more important than you have admitted for they are questions which fall outside the ken of the constitution such questions im sure carry a social implication and set up dynamics in a society much broader than the mere question of civil or legal rights let me state this once again finally considering that people white and black receive all their attitudes and values including their values of self from the world they live what values are they likely to get when reviewing history and the world around them they find the white race at the helmsman wheel in everything and the black man if included at all usually the mere recipient of what the white race has given him i have heard some civil righters say at this point that due to the recent exploits of the new negro posterity will inevitably regard the race as militant and virile and not content with inferior social status perhaps so but how much better it would be for posterity to say that black people everywhere were always socially adhesive took pride in their own race were great artists and builders of culture and political systems that truly promoted the general happiness and above all whenever enslaved looked forever to the day they might again rule themselves this leads us to one other point by analyzing the society one might be enabled to analyze the people in it both whites and black the loyalties of one will be the loyalties of both what this means is perhaps easier to see when matters are hypothetically reversed this is to say if values were defined by blacks according to themselves and all things being equal what we would find in america would be racially opposite to what we find now the whites in the society would be modeling after the blacks in dress in speech etc kinky hair would be beautiful rather than straight hair and black skin would be considered fairer than white skin instead of violins bolstering cultured music there would be the drum the sensual and suggestive hipgrinding dances of black folk would be the most principally accepted in the society not the waltz if also the whites were socially ostracized to the same extent as blacks are now and for the reversed reasons one would find the whites looking to the ethics of the black world for their deliverance this is remember only a hypothesis it is not being advocated in this event one might also find some whites openly calling themselves white nationalists advocating pride in their own concealed history in their thin noses and lips in their own music and dances would this wonder be white supremacy if so that is exacdy what is now being promoted with no questions asked by both blacks and whites alike under the guise of simple humanitarianism believe the failure to understand this has led the struggle of blacks away from the integrity and interests of the group and outward toward socalled humanity and individualism worst it has been directly responsible for the disunity and disintegration which have plagued the black race ever since it set foot in america as long as ones whole orientation ones thoughts and ones ambitions are away from ones own people ones loyalty must of necessity be away from them also people who dont respect each other though of the same race but who seem most inclined to respect those of another race can hardly be expected to stick together there will be little cooperation between them they will be rather quick to condemn each other will sell each other out at first opportunity here you will find snitchers backbiters prosecutors of their own kind and a thick veneer of vanity and boastfulness to conceal their own shortcomings in proportion to the degree the society which they do respect ignores them and their community they will disrespect and ignore themselves you will find in short among them the very phenomena you find among the black society at this time internal bickerings social chaos despair crime a deep longing for escape toward the white world a desire to integrate to marry light to change ones own ugly blackness into a more desirable whiteness to have straight glossy hair and all the rest of the things which black nationalists have brought into focus will earmark this society which doesnt first learn to respect itself in partial summary i would like to leave several questions bent upon integration and social acceptance by white society as many blacks are what will ultimately happen to the black race in america if their aims are accomplished will it finally be absorbed into the white race is this the ultimate goal intended and last if someone challenged a civil righter who used bleaching creams and hair straighteners would he reply oh no im not just for one race i prefer lighter skin and straight hair because im for humanity was russias greatest poet a negro by homer smith as alexander pushkin w d russias greatest and p most beloved poet creator of the russian literary language an olympian among the russian literati of the early th century enemy of tyrants and lover of freedom a negro there has been much misinformation and confusion about pushkins genealogy and african racial connection to the russians he was and is a russian american negroes pardonably and understandably enough call him a negro two examples of this misinformation and confusion both by american negroes come to mind harry belafonte when he visited israel in september told the jersualem post in an interview that he wished to portray alexander pushkin in a film pushkin was half russian and half ethiopian mr belafonte stated jerusalem post september writing in the afroamerican newspapers magazine section on august john jasper stated that alexander pushkin was the son of an african general and a russian girl both of these examples immediately and clearly revealed to me that their writers had done very little or no genuine homework on alexander pushkins ancestry and as a longtime student of pushkins genealogy at the very fountainhead in russia i felt constrained to write the jerusalem post as follows it was biologically impossible for alexander pushkin to have been half russian and half ethiopian if by this mr belafonte meant that one of pushkins parents was russian and the other ethiopian concerning mr jaspers farwrong statement i wrote the afroamerican the following correction through mv research in russia i found that pushkins father was count sergei pushkin white scion of an ancient noble russian family his pushkins mother was called the lovely creole americas leading pushkinist professor ernest j simmons even goes to another extreme and denies that pushkin inherited any negro blood in his biography of the great poet professor simmons claims that pushkins first african ancestor in russia abram hannibal was an abyssinian and not a negro professor simmons even repeated the old fable that the ethiopians belong to the caucasian division of races all attempts to give pushkin a wholly caucasian family tree lineage contradict both peter the great and pushkin in a message to the russian diplomatic envoy in constantinople early in the th century peter the great requested that he be sent a young negro with good talent pushkin himself was always proud of the negro strain in his ancestry at the age of ten years before his death he began writing a historical novel based on the life of his african greatgrandfather its title was to be the negro of peter the great i recall arguing the point of pushkins negro ancestry with professor simmons on one of his visits to russia in the late s we reached no accord with professor simmons adhering to his abyssiniancaucasian descent theory an american i recollect contending should be the last person to try to deny that alexander pushkin was of negro ancestrv indeed had pushkin lived in america he would have been classified even by the united states census bureau as a negro there are millions of colored persons living in america who are far lighter in color than pushkin was and who have equally large direct infusions of caucasian bloodyet in america they are classified as negroes abram hannibal is known to have been black and to have had woolly hair and it is doubtful that peter the great would have wanted his envoy in constantinople to send him a caucasian boy the russian czar no doubt wanted the real thing a leading european pushkinist of russian descent has written that hannibal had thick lips and inkyish hair of pushkin the same authority wrote that he greatgrandson of hannibal had a mass of tight curls on his head and wide nostrils i have visited the area in northern ethiopia from which hannibal came i saw no people there even remotely resembling caucasians all around me were black people with woolly hair it is quite possible that as young hannibal grew to manhood among nobles and aristocrats in russia for statusseeking reasons he might have attempted to claim caucasian ancestry even the black woollyheaded ethiopians of today claim they belong to the caucasian branch of races and in that part of the world whence hannibal came there always has been status seeking even as there is status seeking in america today in some parts of africa and in some eastern countries many persons seek to claim ancestry from some distant legendary hero important family or aristocratic progenitor some contemporary royalty claim however circuitous to have family roots going back to mohammed founder of the islamic religion even in old russia some of the great russian nobles no doubt for status purposes claimed that a legendary and illustrious german named radsha was among the roots of their family trees another contemporary example that has some pertinence to this theme exists today out in hannibals native country ethiopias past monarchswithout any proof except a legendclaimed direct descent from king solomon and the queen of sheba and emperor haile selassie perpetuating the legend claims that he too is descended directly from solomons liaison with sheba when it is recalled that solomon lived one thousand years before the christian era and that ethiopia has had hundreds of kings since then some of them of disparate tribes and all always having kept many concubinesit is certainly farfetched and manifestly incredulous that undiluted descent could have come down from such an ancient lovenest of the king of israel this statusseeking it is possible may have had some bearing on hannibals assumption of the family name of hannibal in when he was a rising young man during his education the young african must have come across the name of the great carthaginian north african general and laid claim to ancestral ties with him some sources claimed and hannibal and pushkin supported the claimthat hannibals father had been an abyssinian prince a royal vassal of the ottoman turks this perhaps was another effort aimed at giving hannibal added status and should be looked upon with a certain amount of skepticism it is highly doubtful that the turks would have sought out and seized the son of a prince when there were so many common and nonroyalblood negro boys available in tracing pushkins african genealogy one must go back to the year peter the great was on the throne of russia the ottoman empire controlled the northern coastal region of abyssinia inland from the coast lived a negro family on the banks of the mareb river the region is known today as eritrea it was not unusual in those days for young negro boys to be captured or bought and shipped to turkey to become eunuchs in the harems of the turkish sultan and his grand vizier and other turkish potentates other young negroes were destined to grow up and become members of the janizary the sultans guard as a dashing young military officer abram gained entree to the best salons of paris where he became a great favorite especially among the french ladies he found life in france so much to his liking that when peter the great demanded that he return to russia abram always found excuses for extending his stay in france finally his excuses became exhausted and in he returned to russia peter the great was delighted at the return of his young protege who had come back as russias first fully formally educated military engineer and fortifications expert peter the great died in but not before he had appointed abram to a high engineering post in the russian army made him teacher of mathematics to the heir apparent to the russian throne and pledged him assurance that his future career was secured but shortly after the death of peter the great abram was shipped off to the russianchinese border to engage in fortifications work but when empress anna ivanovna ascended the russian throne in she recalled abram to st petersburg and aooointed him to the highranking military post of captainengineer at the fortress of pemau in russias baltic lands during his life in france abram seemingly had developed a keen eye for beautiful women and his eyes fell upon a beautiful young girl of greek descent named evdokia daughter of a greek captain in the russian navy andrei dioper the girl disliked abram had no desire to become his wife remarking in an aside that he was as negro not of our kind however back in those days the final word in such matters rested with parents captain dioper consented to abrams request for the hand of his daughter abram and evdokia were married in and it began to look as if hannibals in abram had adopted the name of hannibal descendants would be of africangreek descent but the marriage did not last long evdokia was somewhat of a flirt not uncommon in those days and hannibal accused her of infidelity they separated in as was the custom of the timeespecially when the charge was made by such an important person as hannibalevdokia was arrested not before hannibal had soundly thrashed her and secluded in a military stockade pushkin in one of his light moments remarked that the separation resulted from evdokia giving birth to a white baby girl but this allegation was without foundation for during their life together no child was born to hannibal and evdokia however she did give birth to a child but this was a few years after her separation from hannibal shortly after his separation from evdokia hannibal married christina scheberg daughter of a captain of german origin in the russian service it was rumored at the time that while hannibal was accusing evdokia of infidelity he himself was trysting with christina great compatibility and attachment marked the married life of hannibal and christina eleven children were born to them among them ossip hannibal who was to become the father of alexander pushkins mother nadezhda hannibal the lovely creole christina hannibal died in her seventysixth year abram hannibal lived on until his eightyfourth year he died honored wealthy and holder of the highest decorations that russian rulers could award i have not attempted to prove that because abram hannibal was a negro alexander pushkin must also on that account have been a negro pushkin was born felt thought and lived russian and he was as much russian as dr w e b dubois langston hughes roy wilkins thurgood marshall marian anderson frank yerby james baldwin and about twenty million other nonwhites in the united states are american nor would i be so rash as to attempt to attribute pushkins genius to his negro blood to attempt to solve the riddle of genius is an impossible exercise and it would be a no less impossible task strictly to define race within any restricted ethnological groove despite the fact that dr dubois recently adopted ghana citizenship he did not by that act divest himself of the irrevocable reality that he was born and remains american the big black burly negro by hoyt w fuller early in adolescence i fell under the spell of the freedom of the press idea which was being vaunted with patriotic fervor during those crucial days of depression and eminent war despite the nonetoosubtle opposition at home where the urging was toward the law profession i had decided with that nebulous bullheadedness which since has expanded to elephantine proportions that a journalistic career was for me already my addiction had involved me with a series of school publications and briefly with the production of an irregular appearing typewritten carboncopied newssheet which i personally circulated in my neighborhood the latter publication unfortunately was advisedly suspended after a group of young neighborhood toughs took exception to some precocious civicminded observations made about their delinquent activities this personal thwart however was not sufficient to divert my interest from the fourth estate nor it so happens was a subsequent experience which nevertheless left me considerably more skeptical and measurably less respectful of the american press at a time when most boys were content with reading the comics and scanning the sports pages at best i devoured the whole paper with passion there was not much news in the detroit daily papers about negroes except tor crime stories but this did not botner me too much the race prooiem had not yet squatted fullseat on me and furthermore both tne micnigan chronicle and the pittsourgn courier arrived every saturday to detail with hyperbolics the fortunes failings and frustrations of colored folks now it is wholly true that there were ample additional grounds for me to question the newspapers practice of those principles upon which it based its claim for nearsanctity but nobody paid much attention to such criticism in those days the american press was fair and objective in its coverage the public was toldand apparently believed for the most partand the fact that negroes were routinely ignored or relegated to back pages and special sections was not acceptable evidence to the contrary also negro reporters on white newspapers were rare indeed there being not more than one or two in the whole country and the situation had not changed appreciably several years later whenclimaxing my stubborn pursuit i received my degree from wayne state universitys school of journalism although according to my grades and the evaluation of my instructors i stood near the head of the class i was the only graduate who was not placed in a job by the school one kindly instructor conscious of the loneliness of my position was sympathetic enough to suggest that i might find suitable opportunity in india a nonwhite country which had recently gained its independence but i digress it is an earlier incident which i started out to describe so back to my adolescence because negroes were mentioned so rarely in the regular columns of the daily papers it was especially noticeable when they were mentioned at all there was a column in one of the afternoon papers in which negroes were mentioned more frequently than anyplace else it was one of those homespuntype columns written with deliberate folksiness the emphasis always on what journalism coursesi later learned refer to as human interest in other words the columnist told lots of warmhearted little stories about ordinary people their ups and downs their trials and tribulations their fun and follies for a long time i was fascinated by the negro stories in this column occasionally there were cute stories about maids and cooks and other women domestics but most of the stories concerned a big black burly negro man although the stories tended to picture this negro as somewhat slowwitted childish and amiable he nevertheless struck me as being most remarkable in a primitive sort of way he seemed to be everywhere doing just about everythingeven if he did not do these things particularly welland the white people apparently found him as lovable as they found him laughable and then one afternoon came a disillusioning light there leading off the column was a story about the big black burly negro with the strength of hercules and the heart of gold while waiting to board a streetcar the hero had come to the rescue of an aged white woman too tiny and arthritic to hoist her poor old frame from the ground into the streetcar flexing his powerful muscles and moving in the negro had ever so gently lifted the old woman bodily and deposited her inside the trolley the passengers in the car had cheered so rich in human interest and goodwill was this yarn that the columnist did whatto my knowledgehe had never done before he published the name and address of the big black burly negro and as fate would have it the man lived next door to us at first i could not believe it was true surely there was some mistake it was not possible that the dumb bumbling peripatetic negro in the column could be the man i knew our neighbor was a graduate of the university of michigan a former track star and now a teacher and athletic coach in the public school system a volunteer ymca worker a husband and father surely a man with little time for wandering around the city getting involved in human interest incidents furthermore he was anything but big black and burly he was of average height and build the color of cafe au lait with an extra dollop of heavy cream and as lithe and leanlimbed as in his college days driven by incredulousness and an overwhelming curiosity i went next door and asked our neighbor if the incident described in the column actually had happened to him there was i remember something inexpressibly sad and wise in the smile he gave me yes son i helped the old lady on the streetcar he said when i simply stared at him in obvious bewilderment he went on to explain a lady on the streetcar asked my name and i guess she phoned the paper because the columnist later called me about it he paused a moment then said i hate to say this son but now i wish i hadnt done it i didnt tell him so but i also wished he hadnt done it i went home rather inexplicably depressed and for a long while after that i couldnt read that column at all in fact even after i finally resumed reading the column i never again quite believed all of anything i read in the papers long before i ever sat in a journalism class and learned about human interest stories i was making allowances for the quality called human interest in the stories i read and even though i bullheadedly continued to pursue a career in journalism i knew all along that the more sensible thing to do to say nothing of the more profitable thing to do would have been to study law as the grownups wanted me to the way it works out freedom of the pressand the attendant responsibilityturns out to be a less sacred precept in the practice than when it is being used as a clarion call but then in these united states that seems to be about par for the course should negro women straighten their hair no yes ve stopped pressing my hair after some i years of sizzling hot combs an oftburned and always showing scalp hot weather worry and dirty grease on my pillow i have joined that growing breed of gals both negro and white who continued on page lagos firm is being a criticised for its standing order which for bids its employees to plait their hair the critics say that the order is aimed at destroying our national custom and heritage i beg to differ i think we carry this national pride a bit too far at times even to the detriment of our countrys progress nigeria is not what it was three years ago there is a tremendous change in its physical outlook this is evident by the number of huge buildings that are springing up every day when the lagos executive development board wanted to clear the slums of lagos there was a lot of hullabaloo about the scheme unprogressive people threw a lot of dirty mud at wellmeaning board members but see the new lagos and compare it with the old ive had many letters here from critics for my articles on makeup hairdo and fashion adekunle osho of lagos said in dressing we imitate the english not minding our own attractive custom theresa on her part does not like to plait her hair and she has been instructing her female readers to burn straighten her hair shameful how beautiful was my mother when i saw her last in her onidodo hair plaits and so in this twentieth century and in this age of nuclear devices the adekunle oshos and other nigerians are asking this country to stand still and not to progress in the name of national heritage for it is not only in nuclear weapons nor mechanical devices do we need to advance other things appearances and mode of living are just as important now lets take the argument of another critic j o oyelaja of ijebuode who wrote to say that parliament should legislate against the wearing of western costume i wonder how comfortable a doctor would feela woman in wrapper buba and headtie a man in one of those flowing agbadasin a theatre performing an operation the scots irish and arabs have their national dresses but a kilt is hardly seen in edinburgh capital of scotland during working hours neither is the irish orange sash worn except on special occasions and i am yet to meet a more ardent nationalist than the scot the irish or the arab i run around a lot in this job when i wear the yoruba costume i find that i spend more time than i can afford retying the headtie and the bulky wrapper round my waist and have you tried typing in an agbada i am all for nationalisation but give it to me with some comfort and improvement the fact that women of today hard working with neveramoment to spare do not have premature wrinkles around the eyes and necks is thanks to creams lotion and detergentsin other words cosmetics which killjoys like osho dont seem to like and i challenge him to tell me what is unnigerian about cosmetics the fact is that those we use today save time nigerian women have been using cosmetics as far back as preeuropean days take osun for instance women use the red paste mixed with palm oil to rub their face and body they say it gives a glowing fresh look osun is still used today in many parts of nigeria especially by women whove just become mothers and it is available in the market the only snag is nobody has improved upon it so as not to stain our clothes in the north especially and certain parts of southern nigeria women still use lalispecial leaves which are ground mixed with lime juice and wrapped round the hands and feet there is no better nail varnish than lali for it stays longer on the nails and toes but it takes a long time process which the hustle and bustle of this modern world does not permit tiro is still used by modem nigeria women but it is not handy to take about and again it requires more time and technique which the eyebrow pencil does not demand but the effect in either case is the sameto beautify the eye and surely you readers have heard of ufie made from barks of special trees edo and uli which can be applied on the lips like the modem lipstick the women of eastern nigeria wear either of these shades black red and gold on special occasions and we have the equivalent in other parts of nigeria too and so the only offense we women of today commit is using timesaving applications we still follow tradition but in the modern way finally its time we accepted english clothes not as peculiar to europe alone but the whole world in general in other words lets see them as international dresses which are worn because of their practicability lets do away with inferiority complex have turned forever from the endlesss ranks of hair processors to soap and water and a good stiff brush i who have lived for all my shorthaired life in a nightmare of goldilocks shirley temple curls ponytails and fervent prayers that id awaken one morning with long silken tresses have decided to make do with what i have the decision was not an easy one it took a lot of coaxing a lot of tears and a lot of bucking the tide of criticism and i am a terribly conventional woman my hair problem like most negro womens started some years ago with my first trip to the hairdresser with wideeyed youthfulness i sat down in the chair fully expecting to leave looking like a fairy princess it was a great shock to find afterwards that not only did i have less hair but that my scalp was showing i soon heartened a bit however when i noticed other scalps beaming at me from my schoolroom desk continued from page fully believing my hairdressers claims that she would grow my hair i suffered hopefully until a high school semester in biology revealed to me that it was all a matter of genes and inheritance with this unpleasant knowledge and a brand new electric hot comb in my suitcase i set off for college there was only one other negro girl in my dorm so on every other friday we joined forces and spent a mysterious lockedup evening in my room frying hair and fanning the air i missed one of our sessions because of a meeting so one sunday night that ill never forget i was going it all alone when my bouncyblonde next door neighbor decided to visit panicstricken i pulled on my shower cap fanned the air one last desperate time and disposed of the evidence come in come in i said as casually as possible whats that odd smell she inquired sniffing about oh i dont know i offered rather convincingly and we were off on our usual discussion of poetry and new writers now this was one of my longwinded friendships and while i was reasonably absorbed in our discussion the fact that i was only halffried with that side probably sweating away under the shower cap and that it was past midnight weighed heavily on my mind hey im going to get my pins and set my hair while we talk she announced merrily at am sleepy and thoroughly dismayed i mustered enough courage while she was gone to snatch off the shower cap and resume operations what on earth are you doing she marveled standing in the doorway i pulled her in slammed the door and answered with a bravery born of desperation pressing my hair why on earth are you doing that because it looks better well the undone side looks better to me she said proceeding to pin her hair as if i hadnt just gone through the single most harrowing moment of my life i turned to look at her and in that instant she ceased to be a college friend and became a distressingly smug white girl with the blonde hair that assured her of having more fun an intense hate and envy born of long suffering welled up in me well you pin curl your hair to change it i said venomously well i sure hope i never have to lock myself up to do it she said with a little smile we both laughedi for a reason ill never understand except maybe i was ashamed at being ashamed naturally i believed she was pulling my leg about the undone side and continued to do my own until i graduated and began working desperately wanting my hair to have that career girl look i must have gone to a halfmillion hairdressers all of whom eventually proved unsatisfactory with a perplexed scowl on their faces they either pressed my baby fine hair too straight and the curls didnt last or they didnt press it straight enough and the curls didnt last my hair along with my stomach for hairdressers slowly went to pot and finally i resumed doing it myself frustration led me to a wig which was not my bent and the revolutionary cold curl which worked just fine until i noticed that the brush rollers wound up with more hair than i had on my head i was truly at the end of my rope when i made the decision to go au naturelle i first got a close up view of the natural look at one of those open air art shows the girl was very pretty and i remember thinking at the time she looked absolutely stunning oh i had heard that it was somewhat of a rage in new yorkbut then new york was always having rages id even admired the look on entertainers like miriam makeba and odetta but i never really considered it for me in the meantime i met and married my husband who i might add is a worldtraveled raconteur of sorts and his frequent hints that he liked the au naturelle seemed only like so much conversation we live in america id answer with a laugh and cant you just see me going into my office with nappy hair my boss and everybody else would flip wisely now that i think back he always finally laughed off the issue until another time then one night we went to an au naturelle show featuring the singer abbey lincoln and several very attractive models from new york at a little gathering before the show miss lincoln remarked how her decision to go natural had done so much for her morale and i couldnt help being struck with her pronouncement that she was no longer ashamed of her hair which was impressively well groomed the show was a hit and for the first time for me so was the hairdo the models were stunning and i noticed several women in the audience who had beautifully groomed natural hairdos i also learned that night that there were different styles and different shapes of the hairdo and that it required just as much if not more care than pressed hair of course my husband seized on this opportunity and i heard about the au naturelle every day for nearly a week until he came home one day with the address of an exclusive north side hairdresser and announced that hed made an appointment for me the next day he positively assured me id be more beautiful and unable to resist that possibility i went merrily to the hairdresser the hairdresser who was white and had several other negro customers admonished me for the condition of my hair i dont know why negro women with delicate hair like yours burn and process all the life out of it he complained if youd just wash it oil it and take care of it it would be so much healthier you have no more reason to be ashamed of your hair than white women do of their straight hair i dont know how all this straightening foolishness started anyhow he argued snipping away i couldnt have been less interested in his lecture i was far too anxious for the results i was immensely pleased with my new look until i got back to the south side and faced a lot of searing looks and disapproving stares i brooded through dinner despite my husbands raving reassurance there was certainly nothing i could do but wear it it was far too short to straighten the very next day i had my first bout with open criticism i was walking along thinking about absolutely nothing when a little old mediumisticike woman walked up to me and whispered sympathetically i can grow your hair for you dearie got growing hands i flashed her a withering look and snapped i just paid five dollars to get it cut dearie she backed away in amazement and i enjoyed my first triumph over criticism the next day at work was not so simple with weak knees and a bowed head i went through what seemed an ocean of haveyougonecrazy stares one friend even took me aside to ask if id gone crazy or if i was suffering from some other exotic disease i most certainly was suffering from the illness of outspoken and insensitive people at this point i suppose i would have weakened and run home if it hadnt been for those few and foreverdeartome friends who simply smiled approvingly or said nothing they and my husband gave me a kind of strength ill always be grateful for i still dole out on the average of to a month for scalp treatments and cuts but i dont begrudge the money half as much as when i spent it to get my hair mistreated and strangely enough ive received more compliments although mostly from whites on my hair than ever before people have walked up to me and remarked you look absolutely stunning and that does my battered morale a lot of good im not so involved in the neoafrican aspects of the au naturelle look nor in the getbacktoyourheritage bit and to those fortunate healthyhaired negro girls who still press and dont have to i say onward and upward all i know is that me and my baby fine locks never looked or felt better e coming in a few minutes coming round that bend down there full speed and im gon get out my hankercher and im gon wave it down and us gon get on it and go i keep on looking for it but mama

the heritage of hitler by s carter mcmorris he most abominable aspect of the hitlernazi philosophy was the doctrine of aryanismnordicism hitler never one to mince words spelled it out in mein kampf in his advocacy of a world of stratification of the races with the aryans at the very top of a dominant white race with the yellow and black races assigned to positions in that order hitler and those of his ilk were sincere in their belief in this as well as other phases of their way of life and had they won their war to make the world safe for nordicism we would have soon seen such stratification what the nazis were capable of in the way of racial improvement is demonstrated by their genocide of the jewish people it is shocking to think that in a supposedly scientific civilized world this attitude formed part of the way of life and thought of a system which came to an end only a brief sixteen years ago having been firmly propagandized into the minds of the whole nation during the nazi heyday it would be wishful thinking to suppose that such ideas have been eradicated nor of course were they original in their basic approach with hitler racism or the doctrine of inherent racial stratification has been a part of the philosophy of many individuals who have not hesitated to leave their heritage in literature and of nations which have not hesitated to impose this philosophy in action slavery was the supreme example of the latter nor is presentday racism confined to nazism at bottom the official philosophy of the southern states of this country is that negroes are inherently inferior and should be relegated to the place hitler had in store for them this fact is important for nonwhites american and otherwise for there must be a question as to what extent this southern attitude infects the american program as this nation offers itself as the leader of the western world it is the opinion of this writer that all philosophies and beliefs should find full expression even racism with logic and science eventually pointing the way to that which is valid correct and lasting so i shall attempt to rely upon scientific reasoning and simple commonsense observation to refute the very present doctrine of racial superiorityinferiority those who believe in the stratification of the races point to the backwardness or more politely underdevelopedness of africa and argue that this is inherent while the caucasian they argue has reached a higher civilization because of inherent superiority there are many scientific answers in refutation in the first place there have been periods of history when other than white civilizations were dominant or more advanced secondly just a breath ago in the history of man europeans were in a state of advance about the equivalent of darkest africa today only about years ago did the european adapt the chineseinvented gunpowder for use in war enabling them to conquer and enslave the nonwhites again there is not much question that the chinese and japanese people nonwhite are about as civilized and about as advanced technologically and economically as the european and north americans then too many countries today peopled by caucasians are classed as underdeveloped finally the development of the negro in a world which discriminates against him to a position of near educational and economic equality in america flics in the face of any attempt to explain social differences as inherently biological thus with all the odds and strikes against the american negro he has a highly respected professional class of doctors lawyers engineers teachers social workers etc many recognized leaders in their respective fields he has retail businesses banks insurance companies factories of his own the owners of some of which have reached the millionaire status although the racist argument of the south is that white children will be retarded by integration with the inferior negro in the northern schools where there has been virtually complete educational assimilation of the races much higher educational standards have been attained and maintained with negroes holding their own often excelling scholastically culturally musically athletically as for the african negro both climate and colonial exploitation have been against him and yet he has generally achieved political freedom today while there has been a concerted effort on the part of the colonialists to extend only to a privileged few of the exploited the benefits of education and culture the fact that those who have been exposed to it naturally without effort have taken on every aspect of western culture and civilization belies anything fundamental about the status in which recent history may have placed the african as for the political upheaval in the congo precedent has been set throughout modern history by the wars often civil revolutions even warring over the outcome of elections which was considered characteristic of latin nonnegro america at least until the latest times i would defend not to the death surely but to the highest courts the constitutional right of the racists to believe as they do believe and to express their beliefs more importantly i would assert their right to unemotionally objectively consider the evidence against their point of view for their problem is one of education the presentation of the best thought on the subject upon which their ignorance if not so overcome will be their destruction ignorance is not blissit is death im glad youre dead you r you by isikiah turner ie of the last remaining stalwarts of the american tradition has finally died may his old soul know eternal torment after living a long and ignoble life many no doubt will lament his passing these will say that his demise is untimely personally i will say just two words good riddance i am per fectly happy to take scriptural heed it says weep for those that are born rejoice for those that go to their reward it is said that one should not speak of the dead disparagingly i do not i speak with genuine sincerity im glad youre dead you rascal you in due respect to the departed let us make haste to bury him lest somehow the old scoundrel might be revived there are many who in all probability might contend that uncle tom was bom out of necessity that he was a way of survival be that as it may however as far as i am concerned he is dead and done and while we are burying uncle tom why not make it a double funeral let us bury the old negro image too it is time we realized that we are on the high road of a new day let us create a new image befitting our new roles we are black men we are no longer negroes we must have a spiritual and physical renaissance in our deportment on our jobs in the streets at work or at play we must carry ourselves with dignity we must know that with each degree of freedom or progress we shall make we must also take the same degree of responsibility these two arc twins they come hand in hand it is impossible to have the one without the other those of us who know our potential must feel duty bound to help a brother realize this i speak directly to that black man who by some stroke of fortune feels that he is better than his less fortunate black brother if we can not feel sincerely that we are our brothers keeper we are doomed to languish in that same chasm that others before us are trapped in neither an individual a community a nation nor a world can continue to enjoy so precious a thing as freedom while at the same time denying that freedom to others we must utilize our full capabilities in order to cope with our new duties we must throw away the crutch of selfpity that is something we can bury along with uncle tom we leaned on it much too long we must stop laughing when we are not amused we must stop scratching our bodies when we do not itch we must stop stammering when we know very well we do not have a speech impediment we must remember the fact that uncle tom is dead done and finished we black people of today we men and women of destiny we should ever be reminded that we owe the men and women of yesteryears our fathers and mothers a mighty debt a debt which can be repaid only in our taking full advantage of todays opportunities they dreamed of these days we are the media through which their dreams can become realities failure on our part to apply ourselves in every way possible means a betrayal of that trust and faith which they placed in us those heroic people paid a great and terrible price for todays advantages yes they paid for them in sweat tears labor blood and death we must not be traitors to these honored dead we know that our historical accomplishments have not been given their due recognition we feel that our contributions to our countrys greatness have been deliberately omitted from its history books may i at this time emphasize the fact to anyone who might question my loyalty this is my country make no mistake about that the blood of my fathers was poured into the mortar that holds together the bulwark of freedom which this nations foundation rests on that blood cries to me incessantly reminding me of my sacred duty to all black people who gave their lives to help to make this country great until the black man in this country is accorded full citizenship equality and justice under the law the cries of that blood shall not be quiescent by that same token i cannot have peace of mind therefore i now serve notice on all whom it may concern that until get my just due my voice will become louder and louder indeed it shall become a mighty dirge reverberating throughout the length and breadth of this vast country if i may return to our history again we people of color cannot excuse ourselves for not knowing our history i feel that those of us who do not know of our past should apply ourselves assiduously to correct that situation there are quite a few books on the market today for that purpose find them study them and learn of the many men and women of color who strode across the pages of history and distinguished themselves so nobly we cannot tell others about the nat turners the harriet tubmans the sojourner truths the dunbars the douglasses the washingtons the bannekers the delanys the bruces the smalls to mention a few if we do not know of them ourselves study our folklore search the origins of our blues and spirituals our voodooism and our old sayings you shall be richly rewarded for in them you shall know that our heritage is a very fine one indeed this experience can be electrifying it can be your personal renaissance it can make you walk talk think and act with dignity i sincerely feel that this illumination will prompt you to join me in burying uncle tom and after the planting we will make merry in the streets with singing and dancing in the best tradition of new orleans jazz we will return to the hall marching to that swinging tune i am glad you are dead you rascal you by jay scriba oung matthew henl son was glad to be a w stock boy in a washc ington d c hat store the job didnt pay much but in it was as much as an uneducated year old negro could expect matt called steinmetz one spring morning bring a size seven and threeeighths sun helmet henson hustled the hat to the front room there his employer and a customer looked at him speculatively this is the boy i was telling you about lieutenant steinmetz said the customer was a young naval officer tall and lean with cold blue eyes and a shaggy mustache he clapped the sun helmet on his head looked into the mirror and said to hensons reflection i am lt peary and im going to nicaragua to survey a proposed ships canal between the atlantic and pacific i need a responsible boy to go with me as my personal servant its jungle country a nasty climate the work wont be easy mr steinmetz recommends you do you want the job henson thought a moment then said yes sir i think id like to have it this offhand interchange established a relationship that was to be unique for lt peary was to become adm robert e peary the relentless explorer of the arctic and discoverer of the north pole matthew henson was to be with him until a year journey author floyd miller tells the story of these years in an exciting new book ahdoolo a biography of matthew a henson the negro who accompanied peary to the north pole dutton henson was remarkably mature and capable for his age to impoverished sharecroppers in maryland he had been orphaned and left in the care of a kindly friend aunt jenny he washed dishes in her restaurant and slept in the kitchen at night she tried to send him to school but young matt dreamed of adventure when he was he walked from washington to baltimore hoping to go to sea as a cabin boy a soft hearted captain took him on and for the next six years henson traveled the world aboard the merchantman katie hines the ships officers taught him first to read and write then the skills of an able seaman he learned to play the concertina and developed a good singing voice but when he was the captain died in grief henson shipped aboard a newfoundland fishing boat then went ashore to work as stevedore messenger laborer and finally stock boy in venezuela peary found henson stocky and hard muscled he wielded a machete with the best breaking trail for days through steaming jungle he became a good rifle shot and an expert canoeman he was promoted to pearys personal survey crew still peary refused to think of him as anything but a valet peary was convinced of the white mans superiority favored educated men as explorers and had romantic faith in men who had belonged to a college fraternity preferably in bowdoin his alma mater when the expedition ended peary offered henson a job as his personal messenger and a chance to accompany the first of his arctic expeditions once again however matt was entered on the ships papers as personal servant peary also took his genteel young wife and four men including dr frederick cook who would one day challenge pearys discovery of the north pole the expedition was to explore northern greenland to see if it offered a land bridge to the pole henson was to fetch and carry for mrs peary while the others explored henson handled his servant chores without complaint and was the indispensable handy man carpenter hunter and cook in greenland the eskimos whooped with glee at sight of his dark skin they treated him to feasts of rancid blubber and auks decomposed in oil andtaught him how to build an igloo drive a dog team trap a seal and cross an ice crevasse in turn matt sang and played his concertina he learned the eskimo language so much better than the whites that he became chief negotiator with these sometimes difficult people the expedition was a success and back home henson helped peary with fund raising lectures they made appearances in days and raised then in they were off again although henson found himself again reduced to flunky he became pearys chief assistant in fact if not in name and one of two men who agreed to stay north an extra winter after the first sled treks bogged down he took part in the exploration that proved greenland to be an island marching miles in days and nearly starving to death once henson saved pearys life by dragging him out of a crevasse another time he saved him by toppling a charging musk ox with his last bullet at the end the third man was too sick to think of returning to the arctic a dozen picked scientists gentlemen and fraternity brothers had started the expedition now only henson stood ready to help peary try again henceforth in his writings peary praised henson highly and referred to him as my faithful colored assistant during the next few years henson accompanied peary on several trips to greenland and the arctic peary had the drive and endurance of a man possessed but henson was tougher and in his own quiet way equally determined on one trek peary lay delirious on his sled while henson forced his eskimos to march over miles of ice in below zero weather on another peary staggered along in a daze of pain while henson kept the caravan moving hensons colored friends berated him for accepting shabby treatment without protest during a typical off summer henson worked as a pullman porter while peary vacationed on an island in maine what they couldnt understand was that henson was as emotionally committed to reaching the pole as peary stuffy as ever peary filled his last expedition ship with scholars and gentlemen adventurers the amateurs did fairly well for a time but one by one they had to turn back eyes burning from snow blindness and fingers cracked and bleeding from frostbite finally all peary had left was henson bob bartlett a bear of a newfoundland sea captain and four eskimos to peary the eskimos scarcely counted the only choice was between henson and bartlett and the latter was plainly done in once again in the moment of crisis peary found himself staring into the steady brown gaze of matthew henson the final drive for the pole in april was almost anticlimactic the expedition had leap frogged in building igloos and caching supplies so as to give the returning heroes a string of ready made camps the last camp was miles from the pole and pearys party slogged in five marches the eskimos were dumbfounded when in the midst of a desert of ice peary took a sextant sight and in a voice flat with exhaustion announced that they had reached their goal after nearly years of trying henson was in a mood to celebrate but something seemed to have gone out of peary he fell silent refused henson any show of comradeship and confined his gloating to his diary the pole at last the prize of three centuries my dream and goal for years mine at last on the return trip peary was so worn out that he often had to ride a sled henson kept the sleds moving over miles of ice but for dr cook henson might have fared better pearys party was still in greenland when word came that cook was in denmark claiming he had reached the pole a year earlier peary was furious and as the dispute became an international uproar henson was forgotten eventually most authorities agreed that cook could not have reached the pole meanwhile cook grabbed off most of the money and honors that might have trickled down to henson henson angered peary by trying to lecture on his ownand the two never saw each other again after they returned later as he was vindicated peary was showered with honors but all he ever did for henson was write a preface for his book a negro explorer at the north pole after years exploring henson became a handy man in a brooklyn garage at a week donald macmillan a white member of the expedition and later an arctic explorer in his own right badgered congress for years to get henson proper recognition four times bills were presented in washington and and four times they were bottled up in committee finally in the explorers club of new york voted henson full membership he couldnt often afford the luncheons but it was something then in years after the eventcongress struck off one medal honoring all the men on the peary expedition henson died in at after living for years on a pension of a year the synthetic was preferred by inez lawson y trunk was packed the suitcases had been squeezed shut and as soon as i said goodbye to friends neighbors and relatives i would be ready to leave the great day had finally arrived and i was leaving for college i was going in the words of family and friends to git ah edgeecation it was a privilege and an honor to be able to go soon i was surrounded by everyone and their black brown and beige faces smiled at me through misty eyes filled with pride first one and then another pecked me gently on the cheek and pressed a hardearned dollar or two into my hand with it came a few words of homely advice be a good girl study hard and learn all you can child caint nobody take ah edgeecation away from you dont talk to strange men and finally do your best honey but dont worry up there you wont even know youre black i have had more than one occasion to take exception to the latter viewpoint but that is not important now the interesting thing is that i learned there was some truth to that statementyou wont even know youre blackduring my first spring semester at college i noticed the phenomenon when the lunch room began to have a shorter waiting line around the end of april where on earth was everyone i wondered but it didnt bother me much because a shorter line meant a smaller crowd in the dining roomand that meant bigger and better second helpings one day i returned to the dorm a bit earlier than noon and as i dashed toward my room to deposit my books i was flabbergasted by the sight of countless coeds clad in shorts bras swimming suits and anything else presumably decent they were carrying sunglasses bottles eyepatches towels blankets and an assortment of other things they were all headed in the same directionthe roof there were three negro girls in landon hall we were all crowded together in a twogirl room two seniors and a forestgreen freshmanthe latter yours truly my two worldly roommates were annoyed to put it mildly at my presence in the tiny room they let me know how they felt about living with a freshman and i was worthy only of their contempt with their attitude in mind i decided it would be best not to ask them about the spectacle of seminude girls dashing toward the dormitory roof already i had a new complex i was learning about that in beginning psychology and was reluctant to ask questions i always seemed to be the only one who didnt know what was up or in this case why they were going up like the time during my first month at college when i was invited to a wiener roast wiener roast i discovered too late was coverup language for beerbust which was forbidden by school policy and which was really busted up by the police since then i have never had any inclination to go on a wiener roast even a bonafide one complexes again one day i couldnt restrain my curiosity any longer i dashed back to the dorm before lunch and stood nonchalantly at the bulletin board shortly afterward the parade started the first freshman classmate i saw i grabbed by the arm pulled her around the corner and whispered where is everyone going with nothing onexcept the bare essentials she looked at me and her glance implied amazement then answered in a matteroffact voice for a suntan of course the of course passed me by and i pushed the point why why she blurted as though i had asked a stupid question why because its spring and everyone wants a suntan as soon as possible in the spring oh i see was my brilliant response it was something i needed long hours to ponder and ponder i did it had never occurred to me that anyone who wasnt tan would want to be but then a permanent tan such as mine seemed to be a tan of a different color i knew from the experience of living in a state with sourthern could be that misspelling was a freudian slip sympathies that there was something undesirable about having a permanent tan perhaps it was the novelty of the thing you didnt fade in winter and have the opportunity to bemoan your fate in being so utterly and disgustingly colorless a few months of the year it gave you nothing to look forward to in the spring no long hours of broiling and roasting in the sun no classes to cut for the more important occupation of lying idle soaking up the sunshine and flunking classes yes i decided it was a dreary fate that had assigned me the status of being born with a perpetual tan i puzzled over the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune long into the summer the daily trek to the roof continued and everyone well everyone minus three in the dorm spent countless hours broiling scorching and smouldering beneath the sun i listened during many heartrending hours with what i hoped was a sympathetic ear to the laments and tearjerking tales of my classmates and dormitory neighbors there was many a day when i was ready to weep at the cruelty of nature some of the poor things just couldnt tan think of it they couldnt get any darker they made me feel guilty there i sat as brown as the proverbial berry and i had done nothing to enhance nature i was just born to negro parents and while that fact included certain builtin problems at least there was one problem i would never have to face neverthink of itnever would i taste the ecstasy of spending wasting countless hours sweating simmering and broiling beneath the feverish sun never the joy of rushing to the mirror to see if i was still raw medium or well done never the glance of envy from those poor unfortunates who couldnt tan as they watched me grow darker with each setting sun ah yes life does have its darker moments doesnt it well at any rate by the end of my freshman year some light had been thrown on the statement that up there you wont even know youre black there was one girl less inhibited than the others who used me as a gauge for her efforts at least once a week she bounced into my room grabbed my arm placed it next to hers and rejoiced at the ever diminishing difference the memory of that spring plus the annual antics of the sunworshipping multitude keeps me wondering i am anxious for the psychologists and sociologists to enlighten me i know it will take an explanation by one of these groups with words two inches long before im fully satisfied im sure it couldnt be anything as simple as the fact that a teasing tan is a mite pleasing to the eyes natural or otherwise but perhaps that thought is too absurd especially when one considers the great wall of discrimination built around those who are identifiable primarily because of dark skin color in such cases its a lifetime tan but so far as i have noticed it is not exactly a status symbol the red chinese in africa by brooks johnson year or so ago an american diplomatic delegation went to a new african nation to open the new american diplomatic mission the group was eight strong and headed by a negro upon arrival in africa they found they had been preceeded by a red chinese mission which was strong the red chinese govvernment had wisely recognized the new republic of guinea immediately upon its independence america had vacillated waited and lost valuable time and momentum to the red chinese did we expect that a negro and seven others could possibly offset the numerical and psychological gain that the red chinese already had other incidents of large chinese technical and advisory representations in africa have been reported these reports are doubly alarming when the implications involved are seen china with its own great internal development problems can ill afford to gamble with draining off this badly needed talent and sending it off to africa she can not unless she imagines that what she stands to gain from africa merits such a grave risk the game of power politics tells us that a gamble of this magnitude is not being taken for brotherly love what then in tangible and material values does africa have to offer red china it is felt by some that africa has the latent power to help solve many of chinas problems and to catapult china into the most powerful nation in the world one of the most pressing problems plaguing red china is her population in some fashion under some scheme it is a political and economic necessity that a sizeable number of her inhabitants must go lebensraum for the chinese can come from several places it can come from the area the russians took from them namely outer mongolia and sakhalin but this is highly unlikely the russians were not disposed to give them this land when relations between the two behemoths were warm it is not expected that the russians will be apt to show any great generosity now that the relationship has cooled another area which might help china ease her population problem is south east asia but here again the chinese may find they are somewhat stymied the new federation of malaysia is a direct britishmalayan defense against red chinas expansion in that direction malaya the worlds largest producer of rubber and tin is one third chinese the malayans are deathly afraid of the bulging industrious chinese population there singapore eighth largest harbor in the world serves as the port and is the lifeline of malaya although it is a political entity in itself it needs the trade that passes to and from malaya or it will become just another swamp as it was before the tin and rubber trade made it the pearl of asia singapore is overwhelmingly chinese there cannot be any effective federation of malaya and singapore alone that will not have a sizeable chinese majority the problem has been neatly solved by adding the other british protectorates of brunei sarawak and north borneo as members of the federation in doing this the british have assured that the nonchinese population as illiterate and in many cases lethargic as it is will at least have a solid majority in adding these last three british protectorates they have also included the oil rich reserves of brunei the effect of all this if successful will be to deny the chinese the opportunity of taking over in the prementioned areas it should also be noted that in some of these areas the chinese minority has been defranchised harried and even stripped of property holdings some nations have nonimmigration laws against the chinese if china fails in south east asia she will no doubt have to look farther afield for her badly needed lebensraum the fact that africa for centuries has been a catchbasin for some of europes population overflow has not escaped the keen eye of the chinese communists one of the biggest problems that china faces also coincides with that of over half of the people in the world today hunger china needs million tons of grain and rice a year to feed her people she is able to produce about million tons a few asian nations such as thailand have a surplus of rice to export most are like japan which has to import much of what she eats this reduces the amount available for red china because she has an unpopular credit system whereas nations such as japan pay cash this coupled with the overall fear many nations have of china causes her to lack a quarter of her needs even though she gets some grain from canada which in turn gets it from america it is very clear that mao tsetung does have a very pressing food problem the food problem of mao brings to mind the words of another dicta tor mussolini mussolini said give me ethiopia and i will feed europe no one gave ii duce ethiopia with the tacit permission of the league of nations he took it but he never got around to feeding europe however having seen the rich plains of ethiopia it is easy to understand why he was moved to say this ethiopia has a fine rich soil in many areas there is an ideal average temperature of degrees it is felt that in some areas crops can be harvested twice a year while in others it has been set at three times yearly ethiopia is not the only rich and arable land of africa but the very thought of such harvests must have set millions of hungry chinese mouths watering there are many other areas which could be made to produce enormous amounts of foodstuff with modem techniques and equipment any nation hoping to aspire to world prestige and power must have certain essential elements steel oil and technical skills are among the more basic prerequisites china is woefully deficient in the first two africa has the very rich mineral deposits south of the sahara and the oil of the libyan desert in all areas of subsaharan africa where minerals are to be found the chinese are not far away africa sorely needs to establish plants and facilities on her own soil to process her raw materials under the colonial system these treasures were taken to the colonizing nation processed and sold back to the african at inflated prices if processing is done in africa then africans will have more freedom and flexibility as to whom they can sell their products they will also be able to enter the international market on a fuller scale this the red chinese are working very hard to develop in the process of doing so they are not making themselves unpopular with the african economic developers the reason for the gamble china is taking in sending some of her crack technicians to africa becomes clearer when the potential of a combination between china and africa is seen both nations need and want more trade to reach their respective potential both are interested in seeing africa have more freedom regarding the disposal of her products africa needs technical aid which china has to a limited extent africa has large deposits of natural resources which china badly needs both want to see the disappearance of interference by western powers in this area it would appear that china would have an unlimited right of way directly into the economic capitals of africa but in her drive and designs on africa china has three major obstacles which frustrate her efforts they are the united stateswestern bloc influence and interests russian activity and programs and african nationalism the first two considerations are important at present but there is some reason to believe they might become less so as time passes my reason for saying this is based on the following observations as africa grows stronger she will in the words of julius nyerere president of tanganyika pick her own friends and we do not allow our friends to pick our enemies america has the greatest persuasive force of all as far as african friendship is concerned this force is million in numberand black africans having had in most cases experiences with colonial oppression are very much attracted by democratic ideals this is natural and follows the same desire pattern as the american revolutionaries held after their fight for independence the united states being a democracy the oldest functioning one in the world has some direct parallels and comparisons it could make between the new african nations and the united states in both cases the continents of africa and america had to throw off foreign domination and colonial exploitation ironically the stories are almost carbon copies of each other the propaganda potential of the parallel is almost limitless the major flaw in the beautiful comparisons however is the treatment of the american negro in the united states despite their preference for democracy how can it be rationally believed that black africans can trust a nation which treats its own black citizens so undemocratically to further compound the situation the cases of undemocratic treatment of black africans themselves in the united states occurs with devastating regularity much of the black distrust of the united states could be overcome if the u s would merely uphold the law and the spirit of the declaration of independence and the constitution these things white americans everywhere take for granted there are some sections of the united states where a negro takes his life in his hands when he attempts to get even the most minimal benefit from these documents the racial folly of the united states is not limited to its national boundaries our white diplomats take their stateside prejudices to their posts in africa we have a report of e frederick morrow first black man in the white house who said that he was told that the wife of a diplomat about to be stationed in africa had the audacity and poor taste to let it be known to negro newsmen that she and her diplomat husband were very disturbed at being stationed in africa she and her husband considered it an injustice a step down and an extreme hardship it is known in many areas that the american colony sits off by itself in these countries and there is only a minimum attempt at contact between the american personnel and the native population programs such as the peace corps and some genuinely inter ested diplomats have to be spared this accusation americans have not omitted africa north of the sahara either while in libya i met and talked with a group of libyan employees of american oil firms doing business in the rich libyan oil fields one of the men had been sent by an american firm to the united states to study a phase of petroleum technology at the university of oklahoma upon his return to libya he was given the post of timekeeper the person holding the position he had been trained for was an american and did not have a commensurate background the american although not as skilled was getting several times more pay and privileges americans were discriminating against this man in his own country there were other examples related to me it seemed that there was enough discontent among many of the trained workers for them to form an informal organization based on the discriminatory practices of american firms operating in libya their goal was to pressure aging king idris not to renew contracts of the various firms when their agreements expired here we have a case of americans blindly cutting their throats with a doubleedged knife in one instance they train and educate a man under their contract agreement then once he has been taught how to do an important and vital function he is discriminated against when men are hired to perform this function the result is a group of highly trained men skilled in the vital operation of oil production who are dissatisfied with american methods these men are now organizing to force the american interests out here we have american capital paying for their training and american prejudices causing agitation for american departure russia is not to be found sleeping in regard to the potential that africa offers her activity in the congo crisis brought this dramatically to light just as china is having trouble feeding her masses we have been reading of similar problems arising from crop failures in the ussr food is not the only resource that africa offers the oil minerals and general discontent of the people of africa are prime targets for communist designs in the area but the russian effort is thwarted in several ways like the americans they seem to be their own worst enemy we have read of african discontent at discriminatory practices in certain communist countries of the balkan sea area it is also known that the same practices and complaints have come from those who found themselves in schools in russia itself further the africans have looked with some concern on the ruthless russian suppression of the hungarian revolt for selfdetermination were the hungarians seeking anything more than the africans themselves want in africa itself the russians like the americans are running into a type of social suicide the russian technicians and advisors are very exacting and demanding in the standard of performance they expect on the technical projects they supervise they make no attempt to conceal their contempt for african workers who are not as adept as their advisors would have them be this of course is unfair to an african who is just beginning to learn the skill at which he is employed he reacts unfavorably to the russian conduct and opinion concerning him after all is the russian so unlike in mannerism and demeanor the european who formerly looked down his aquiline nose at him the african has labored against almost impossible odds to win independence in order to succeed in his desire for independence of the white mans rule the african has had to undergo great pressures and stress in order to accomplish this a strong will and faith was needed there had to be a focal point there had to be something around which he could attach his dreams this substance that he drew upon the thing that sustained him was an intense identification with his heritage his land and his color this has been called nationalism the more tyrannical the rule he had to overthrow the more intense the sense of nationalism became in many instances this nationalism was diverted to racial lines the whole problem was simplified for mass digestion and became black against white politicians today in many areas of africa find it impossible almost to win an election with pleas for moderation on the race question because there is such a strong feeling in many areas against whites from whatever country the chances of russian communism getting too strong a hold in africa are proportionately reduced by the same token the americans are not much better off this is especially so when the african hears of the discrimination practiced against black people in the united states the red chinese did not suffer as much from the color barrier as the other countries that are anxious to get a foothold in africa the chinese are not white and can more palatably speak in terms of their brotherhood with the african the biggest act of aggression of which the chinese have been guilty outside of their own borders is against the indians in many areas of africa however the indian is somewhat persona non grata this is because it was usually the indian who predominantly constituted the merchant class he was not exactly white and did not necessarily consider himself black like most businessmen he was reluctant to see the status quo upset and his proprietary interest put in doubt he naturally seemed to favor the colonial power even in cases where the colonial power refused to grant him full franchise in the civil_rights area this middleoftheroad feeling did not endear the indian to the african so the chinese do not have a race question or a hungary to mar their propaganda efforts the fact that both the african and chinese are colored does not seem to be sufficient to bridge the gap between the relationship that now exists between china and africa and what the chinese so fervantly want it to be china is daily growing further and further away from russia this not only involves ideological separation and alienation it necessarily involves economic and technical alienation also china is hard put to find other areas to fill the voids that the withdrawal of russian aid and cooperation will bring about the natural and most profitable place would be africa africa has a need for some of the things china can supply as limited as her technical resources may be china still has more than is now present in africa the chinese technicians unlike the russians and other advisors are more tolerant and patient with the apprentice african bonds of color tolerance and mutual need are being welded between the african and the chinese with western prejudice and ineptness serving as a catalyst the west with its arrogance and racial stupidity seems to be in no real position at present to stem or stop chinese progress in africa the soundest speculation as to what will prevent africa from becoming dominated by red china would center around africas intense desire to remain free of foreign domination it does not take a great deal of perception to see that a combination of china and africa is potentially one of the most formidable alliances conceivable one of the very real and potent advantages that china has is the solution to the south african and portuguese colonies in africa julius nyerere made it quite clear in a recent speech at the national press club in washington d c that african leaders consider it most urgent and necessary that africans in these areas gain their independence and control of their country when asked what the united states ought to do about the situation in the republic of south africa he said america ought to convince south africa that she america means to defend freedom wherever it is in danger with everyone present aware that the means of defending freedom in south africa is through the use of arms it was blatantly clear that he was calling for armed support from the united states in the struggle for the freedom of the black south african it was also very plain to all present that the united states europe or russia would not undertake such a drive there may have been some relief in the minds of some as they realized that the united states europe nor russia would hazard such a venture but there was also some dread on the faces of others who realized that china was not in all probability afraid to take such a risk south africa is the richest and most developed nation in africa it may very well prove someday to be the pivot point of all africa with its technical skill and advancement coupled with a black administration it would have to play a most dominant role in any united states of africa if western recalcitrance on the apartheid policy there provides for red china to send in liberation troops or in some other way gain a foothold there then china would have a valuable satellite from which to influence the policies of the remaining african nations not to mention the bolstering of her own economy even assuming that china is not able to gain any real control in south africa she still could derive a great deal of goodwill by having the courage to assist other african nations which feel it is imperative that action be taken in south africa of course the same goodwill would fall to any other nation forthright enough to assist actively in the south african crisis in the even of a limited nuclear war china is one of the few nations which could survive the population lost in a sense it would be a blessing for them in terms of area mass the two areas in question constitute a sizeable portion of the world in the event of a continued peace the alliance is still one of great power it becomes patently clear that if china is given unrestricted even limited but effective access to the resources of africa she will then emerge at the least as the third major power in this instance she will have to be considered in any plans to ensure the peace keeping her outside of the united nations will be impractical and impossible if we are to continue seeking world understanding and peace through this body it would appear than any sustained peace will have to resolve itself through the machination of some international body such as the un if china is allowed to draw upon the resources of africa there will naturally arise a system of interdependencies and common interests in world affairs much like that which now exists between countries of the western bloc with the new common interests and bond with africa and the added influence her power will be able to exert in asia we have an international organization with china at the fulcrum the afroasian bloc will have the majority of the votes in any such organization and will therefore be able to dominate it to some degree the men who most fear and abhor such a condition most are too deeply immersed in their own dumb arrogance and stupid prejudices really to do much about this it is they in their amazingly narrow and shallow perspective who feed gasoline to the flame of which we speak it would appear that the salvation of the westrn blocas the western bloc likes to picture itselfis no longer up to the western bloc it is now in the hands of the africans the salvation of the western bloc in its position of power and prestige lies with the very force which was employed to throw off the influence of this bloc in africa in one wordnationalism africans have had to fight too hard and too long to allow their prized possession to fall into the hands of another outside power the pressures and stresses hardships and pains which the western world placed upon them forced them into a type of national cohesiveness which all but reversed the trend and flow of history this spiritual substance is not easily dissipated it is not likely that the africans will give up their hardearned independence to any outside nation the scars are still too recent from the last such foreign influence it will be this fear and jealousy that will stop the red chinese short of their ultimate goal in the meantime we can no doubt depend upon some economic social and cultural intercourse between the two giants this will undoubtedly benefit both in some areas let us hope that as they prosper and gain material goods their interest will more equate and align itself with those of the western world ensuring that some degree of permanent and harmonious integration on an international scale will result the necessary negro by art buchwald er since civil_rights leaders have been protesting job discriminate ej tion and threatening to sr boycott any company that doesnt hire negroes the major corporations have been searching desperately to have at least one negro on the payroll in something more than a menial position for the first time the collegeeducated negro is being wooed by large companies who need him desperately to avoid a national boycott since most of the big companies have never hired negroes for executive positions before they really are at a loss as to how to go about it the search is going on very quietly and no one is willing to talk about it but the competition is getting so fierce that we wouldnt be surprised if it went something like this two vice presidents of the mackerel soda co are sent to interview thomas jefferson jones who holds a ba and an ma and a doctor of philosophy degree from mit before birmingham jones was working as stockroom clerk in a large new york department store but now everything has changed mr jones the first vice president says wed like you to join our company in an executive position if i understand you correctly jones says youd like me to be your executive negro no nothats not it at all the second vice president says weve been searching for some time for somebody with your qualifications to head up our interdepartmental bottling sales liaison what is that exactly its a new job which would require you to consult and report and make suggestions on managerial procedures that could improve consumer interest on a company level i see jones says but youd want me to sit near the door as a matter of fact we would but that has nothing to do with the job why do you ask the star rubber co offered me a similar position provided id sit near the door so anyone who came in could see they hired negroes but that isnt our main concern mr jones we are much more interested in getting the best team possible for the company im sure of that jones replies what would my title be we hadnt given it any thought the ezra light gas co offered to make me executive vice president in charge of broken meters we could make you vice president in charge of refunds on bottles that sounds pretty good jones says what does it pay twentyfive thousand dollars plus fringe benefits plus a house in an allwhite neighborhood and police protection for a week while you move in the wagon train food co offered fringe benefits and membership in their company country club well meet the offer one of the vice presidents says on the other hand jones says the frothy dairy co offered me a year and a stock option as well as a bonus and profitsharing plan all right well meet it just sign here i cant gentlemen jones says why not the department store where i used to work as a stockroom clerk has just made me chairman of the board what are you going to do for them one of the vice presidents asks sit near the door the soul of modern jazz by leroi jones think there are very few people who are r close to jazz who would dispute the fact that the three most important saxophonists in all jazz history up to now have been coleman hawkins lester young and charlie parker there have of course been other important jazz saxophonists but these three men have been more than just brilliant instrumentalists and gifted improvisors what is most important is that they were innovators and lasting influences on their contemporaries and every other jazz musician to come after them no matter what instrument they might play just as you once could find and can still find piano players or guitarists who patterned their styles on what louis armstrong did on trumpet so you can find diverse instrumentalists making curious or not so curious uses of what bean pres and bird have done charlie parkers influence is just as important to postbop piano players as it is to saxophonists even a musician as patently individual as vibist milt jackson must admit to being heavily influenced by the coleman hawkins attack there are guitar players and trombone players whose styles owe a great debt to lester youngs behindthebeat cool definition of jazz but as far as jazz saxophone the same time and still come up with something beautifully singular one thinks immediately of a tenor man like lucky thompson who seems to have understood both hawkins and young equally and to have arrived at an astonishingly original use of both those antithetical concepts of tenor saxophone playing gene ammons is another fine tenor player who puts both young and hawkins to work in his own playing and manages to emerge as a fascinating stylist charlie rouse yet another and of course there are many more the point is that for every paul quinichette say who was content to utilize merely lester youngs heavy influence or sonny stitt who could hear only parker or chu berry who was fastened to hawkins there were other players who were able to take some of the strongest qualities of two of the innovators or even all three after bebop and the emergence of charlie parker as the third giant of the jazz saxophone and fashion their own personal styles it is possible to trace the development and ascendancy of the saxophone in jazz by citing just what each of these three men contributed coleman hawkins is known by most jazz people as the man who invented the saxophone it was bean who first made the sax a respectable instrument as far as jazz musicians were concerned before his appearance the instrument was used largely for its novelty effect in dance bands and those hotel or theatre groups known as mickey mouse bands hawkins took the horn and inspired by louis armstrongs trumpet technique developed a huge tone and a smooth onthebeat approach to saxophone phrasing that brought the instrument into its own as a jazz solo voice and for a long time after hawkins almost anyone who played the instrument sounded like him there was just no other way lester pres young brought the tenor saxophone to perhaps an even more autonomous position as a solo instrument instead of emulating hawkins wide toned onthebeat eighth note approach pres inspired as he said by the cmelody saxophone of frank traumbauer brought a light flowing gauzy tone to the tenor he also liked to lag just a little behind the beat and accent this penchant by laying out or resting at them unusual places in a phrase and then swooping lazily but impeccably back into the phrase as if he had never stopped playing hawkins saxophone work as impressive as it was was really just an extension of the louis armstrong trumpet style to another instrument but young made for the first time a music that was strictly a saxophone music and his flexible almost uncanny rhythmic sense provided a model for many of the young musicians who came along in the s to produce the music called bebop since young jazz has become increasingly a saxophone music in the sense that the musics chief innovators since that time have been saxophonists from the earliest days of jazz the chief solo instrument had been the trumpet and trumpet players like the fabled buddy bolden freddy keppard king oliver and louis armstrong the musics most illustrious soloists but hawkins demonstrated how powerfully jazz could be played on a saxophone and young made the saxophone potentially the musics most expressive instrument alto saxophonist charlie parker was one of the two most exciting soloists jazz has seen so far the other of course being louis armstrong and as such he made jazz musicians even more saxophone conscious after parker trumpet players piano players guitar players bass players etc all tried to sound like him in much the same fashion as all kinds of instrumentalists had once tried to sound like armstrong parker made the conquest of the music by the saxophone which young had begun very nearly complete since young we have had roy eldridgc dizzy gillespie fats navarro miles davis clifford brown all as brilliant trumpet soloists but the chief innovators have been saxophonists and just as parker was the soul and fire of the bebop era in fact most jazz saxophonists are still heavily indebted to him it is still saxophonists who are the fiercest innovators in contemporary jazz right at this moment three of the most daring innovators in jazz are saxophone players and a curious coincidence is that like hawkins young and parker the proportion remains the same that is two tenor saxophonists and one alto player make up the triumvirate the tenor men are sonny rollins and john coltrane the alto player is ornette coleman the most controversial of the three of the three rollins has been on the jazz scene the longest having come up with the second generation of boppers rollins like everyone else of the period was deeply affected by charlie parkers music and his style on tenor has always shown parkers influence but by the mids rollins came into his own and began to play his own horn and since then he has become an extremely ubiquitous influence himself in fact rollins was perhaps the strongest voice of the recent hard bop trend it was a trend that was marked by a return by many jazz musicians to what they considered their roots as a reaction to the soft timbres and rigid arrangements of cool jazz saxophonists began to utilize wider and harsher tones of which sonnys was the widest and harshest and most expressive and accompanying piano chords became more basic and simplified often relying on a sort of gospel or churchy feeling to emphasize the afroamerican beginnings of the music this trend still persists in what is called soul music or funky jazz which is still enjoying a great deal of popularity but rollins has since gone on to deeper and even more expressive things albums like way out west freedom suite and saxophone colossus showed that sonny was interested in being more than fashionable and he still had more experimenting to do john coltrane after playing with various rhythm and blues groups and one of dizzy gillespies big bands late in the s began to be noticed in the middle s as a member of the miles davis quartet and quintet coltranes biggest influence for quite awhile was dexter gordon who also influenced rollins and was one of the earliest people to transfer parkers approach to the tenor saxophone coltrane was also struck quite a bit by rollins but by the time he finished playing with thelonius monks wild groups he was well on his way to becoming one of the most singular stylists in jazz the youngest of the three current saxophone innovators is alto man ornette coleman he is also the one whose innovations have been most challenged by many jazz critics and musicians whose short sightedness makes it difficult for them to accept the genuinely new just as young and parker were for a long time considered charlatans or merely inept except by a few musicians and critics who tried to understand what they were doing so young coleman has had a difficult time of it but he has been to my mind the most exciting and influential innovator in jazz since parker and even though coleman didnt arrive on the big time jazz scene until he has already managed to influence to quite an extent the other two major innovators rollins and coltrane not to mention the myriads of other younger players regardless of their instrument rollins and coltrane had mature styles before ornette coleman was known even to jazz insiders rolins huge tone which often sounded like coleman hawkins paraphrasing charlie parker and his ability to improvise logically and beautifully from thematic materials rather than chordal were the things that characterized his precoleman style coltranes sound was and is smaller and less rigid than rollins and because of its striking similarity to a human cry it can often raise the hairs on the back of your neck rollins seems always to address himself to any extemporization in the most formally logical manner while coltrane strings seemingly endless notes and scales together making what some critics called sheets of sound coltrane and coleman have almost diametrically opposing approaches to a jazz solo coltranes music takes its impetus and shape from the repeated chords that harmonically fix the tune in fact he plays sometimes as if he would like to take each note of a chord and sound it singly but at the same time as the overall chord it is like a painter who instead of painting a simple white paints all the elemental pigments that the white contains and at the same time as the white itself but ornette colemans music has been described as nonchordal that is he does not limit his line to notes that are specifically called for by the sounded chord the form of a coleman solo is usually determined by the total musical shape of what he is playing that is the melody timbre pitch and of course the rhythm all of these moved by ornettes singularly emotional approach to jazz in much the same way as the older primitive blues singers produced their music and this has been his largest influence on the two older men this freedom that coleman has insisted on in his playing has opened totally fresh areas of expression for coltrane and rollins as well but in the context of their own demandingly individual conceptions on rollins latest records such as our man in jazz victor lps and club dates or on coltranes recently recorded live impulse a or inperson solos the influence of this revived concept of free improvisation based finally on the oldest sense of form in afroamerican music the individual reaches its most impressive manifestation and of course ornette coleman himself on his records or in person continues to excite intrepid jazz listeners all over the country with the fierceness and originality of his imagination at this point in jazz the most imaginative voices continue to be saxophonists though the pianist cecil taylor has also to be cited in any list of recent innovators in jazz and it would seem that not only have rollins coltrane and coleman learned from the three original saxophone innovators hawkins young and parker but they also seem seriously intent on becoming innovators of the same stature it is certainly not a farfetched idea do by robert brackney eginning with mr pavlovs celebrated ca nine there has been sufficient number of experiments in producing neuroses in animals to establish a universality of behavior patterns of animals under artificial conditions and to outrage the aspca the reactions of a guinea pig for example to the repeated stimulus of electric shocks might include asociality loss of appetite or behavioral bizzarrerie in general in the animal homo sapiens negro genre however the reaction to the attention paid the group en masse has been the most curious form of introspection i am a homo sapiens caucasian genre an easterner by birth but a californian since i grew up in ivory suburbia and for many years my contacts with negroes were tenuous deprived of knowledge by lack of social contacts with negroes i found it easy to accept the conventional image of the negro the boy image the rhythmic relaxed obedient and perennially faithful servant a slightly benevolent variation of the white southerners good negro concept i also found it easy to sniggle at racial slurs and jokes purveyed by my contemporaries in my imagination as in theirs the negro albeit on american soil remained one with the jungle and his culture essentially african in those days my knowledge of african culture was even more negligible than my contacts with negroes living in a los angeles suburb until recently devoid of negro residents i tended to regard any negro es seen in the city as some sort of curiosity this continued until when my aboutface was accomplished in a most forceful manner in september of that year thenpresident eisenhower ordered federal troops to little rock to enforce desegregation i began to do some wondering who were these peo pie what could be so offensive about a people that they had to storm doors through which i could pass unnoticed i had not realized in my relative security that below me socioeconomically were people who strained against the iron chains of whitesmy peoplesignorance and who had to struggle to attain those things i took for granted aroused i began to read constantly on the matter of race i sampled james baldwins notes perused states rights literature and immersed myself in native son the result was an even more gripping obsession with race problems my interest in the matter redoubled finally when i decided i was old enough to go for myself i deliberately sought the negro neighborhood obtained quarters and with enormous selfconsciousness took up residence nothing happened i couldnt get over it it was all the same as it had been before the same play with a different cast i admit in retrospect that i had been brainwashed i had expected to find tribal customs and a backward way of life when i didnt i was frankly surprised my selfconsciousness subsided and i decided that as far as i was concerned it was all the same there was no need for scholarly theses exploring negro culture or comparing it to white culture no need for doctorates on inter or intraracial relations notes of a native son but was there as i became wellacquainted with the other tenants in the building a strange phenomenon began to unfold it seemed that the negro so long the object of white americas social microscope has been made so inescapably aware of race that he has begun to interpret the behavior for which his socioeconomic level environment or even his individuality is responsible in terms of race until i discussed this in earnest with a negro lady whom i liked and whose company i sought i had taken cum grano salis glancing references by negroes to racial behavior coming from a close friend and companion however from one who held as tenaciously to her own philosophy as many a southern white holds to his own it was upsetting economic practices alleged inter and intraracial relations even the matter of sexuality were ascribed to race we people soon became just as overworked and just as blanket a phrase as the one the white man uses the negro i cannot remember how many times i was told you just dont understand our people had i sampled only the icing on the cake where had been the truth in my youthful fantasies about the negro and the negro community the wrightinduced visions of endless rending of pornographic songs seminude figures sitting in littered airshafts of fivestory walkups where were the myriad vices of which negroes had been accused it had not taken long for my own experience to shatter the myths surrounding the negro and to establish that the only differences between the negro race and other races were epidermal yet in an instant i doubted all over again it seems likely that the negro does not call these alleged racial characteristics to his defense as scripturally as he would invoke the enviable accomplishments of such as ralph bunche and daniel hale williams to establish his capability and capacity for similar greatness rather it seems that through the intensity of attention focused on him and because of all that has been said and written of him by his own and by others he has actually come to take some of these things quite seriously the negro has been under the social microscope for so long and to the exclusion of practically all the other minorities on this continent that he has begun to take a peek for himself to find out what is so darn interesting about him there is little doubt that the information that is offered in this manner is an attempt at racial enlightenment an attempt to effect racial understanding but the constant drumming on we people instills white minds with one idea negroes are different and it is but a short step from different to unfit for firstclass citizenship or if you will social equality by unconsciously purveying suggestions of unbridgeable differences between the races and by unwittingly perpetuating in some instances the vicious sexual legend that has so long handicapped him and debarred him from his birthrights many a negro has been his own worst enemy it is a strange and sad truthbut many a negro fails to see himself as he would have others see him by falling for the cliches and nebulous stereotypes that spring automatically to many white minds he has actually placed roadblocks in his own path and is finding it harder to surmount them than it was to erect them by hoyt w fuller new world a coming could it be at long last that negro

militant many maintain that washingtons reputation grew at the behest of segregationists who saw in him a fitting idol for negroes since he advocated separate development and douglass was unacceptable both because he insisted upon an equal role for negroes and because he married a white woman it is interesting to note that even today the public assessment of the two men gives a considerable edge to washington although washingtons views would be rejected by most negroes today earlier this year doubleday also published douglass autobiography it was in paperback however one of the dolphin series

she lifted her firm young chin up and away from the snowy froth of lace collar and swept out of the shining sunny breakfastroom her heart beat it knocked against her ribs her fine blue eyes were aglow with righteous wrath the newspaper she held was bunched and gathered in her fist and torn by her impotent anger she marched into her kitchen that was so yellow and fresh in the morning sunshine where light dancing along the chrome and porcelain surfaces sent silvery reflections to glimmer against the pale enameled ceiling peace and prosperity dwelt in the room the clean cabinets were neatly crowded with the finest condiments and all manner of delicacies and the aroma of the splendid breakfast still stood upon the warm air ennis bulked at the sink her aging hands deft among the rainbow soapsuds she was humming a minor tuneless upanddown melody that had no form it was strangely sweet her heavy gray oiled hair was done up in a tight neat bun and her large body was encased in an icewhite uniform that creaked when she moved so stiff it was with smooth oldfashioned handbeaten starch young mrs lee gathered together her breath and her courage she well knew that she was overstepping a most delicately balanced social boundary but she did not care she had to speak up this once or burst so filled was she with that noble emotion called moral indignation ennis she said ennis turned smiling her hands gone quiet in the warm water yesm young mrs lee held out the crumpled raddled paper ennis i wish to apologize to you for this atrocitythese atrocitiesi wish i could tell you just how really sorry i am about it about all of it ive been reading it herehow that school wont let that young man indid you see it of course you must have and ennis i think its dreadful all he wants to do is go to school what makes people so cruel its a terrible thing a perfectly terrible thing and im so sorry about it about everything and i do mean it so she gazed earnestly at ennis her azure eyes quite damp and she decided right then and there to give the maid an extra week off with pay in the summer perhaps it would help to offset the years of black pain black panic and black loss that she suddenly thought she understood all of mrs lees days had been spent in the midst of clean serene spaciousness she had never worked for money for the sake of her belly she had always possessed shining slippers for her little feet with new ones wrapped in tissue for sundays and special occasions she had forever owned her pinkish flesh her yellow hair and her blue eyesand her absolutely inalienable rights lately however she had found herself trying to dismiss the fact that something queer was going on out in the nonfashionable part of the world that just outside her white and exquisitely panelled front door there was great lamentation and an ominous rending of the very air sometimes she feebly discussed events with her husband and acquaintances but the conversations would always return to the old safe grooves such as the schoollunchprogram the latest dirty good bestseller and the doings of certain couples she saw ennis as an enormously capable shadowy extension of herself until this morning when she read the papers and looked at her servant she dazedly realized that ennis was a human that ennis had a life the maid did not vaporize at five oclock she went home to a ghetto she went home to crime and sex and dirt if ennis was disturbed by mrs lees awkward and extraordinary outburst she gave no sign of it she was used to masking her emotions in the presence of white people of exercising a certain amount of reserve but now she turned all the way around and looked at her mistress eyebrows high that boy aint had no busness goin down there and stirrin things up miz lee she said aint gonna make things no easier fo nobody but they want to kill him ennis if it hadnt been for those federal troops hed be dead them soljers aint gonna be round long then he wont neither mark me miz lee he shouldna never done it fus thing you know evbody be fightin and we gets long fine up here you jus got to tend t yo busness and pay yo bills and try t make it bes way y kin you do so have trouble here ennis i think hes truly trying to do something about it hes trying to end an old and terrible wrong cant you see how y gonna end trouble by makin trouble ennis asked by stirrin up riots and all we got t grow to it its gonna come but that boy caint cram hisself down nobodys throat an spect em t like it we gots t git it slow it got to be earned y like me t vite mself t yo nex pahty yes cried mrs lee extravagantly you are hereby now in vitedif it would make one particle of difference ennis chuckled and returned to her dishes mrs lees voice was tremulous doesnt he have the right to go to any school that he wants to attend she went to stand close to ennis to look into the dark tired handsome face dont you want your grandson to have a better life ennis rinsed a fork and thought what is wrong with this white woman aloud she said we gots good schools theys plenty schools he coulda gone to thout all this messmy granboy be all right his lifes bettern mine an my lifes easiern my mamas was those folks just outrageous they oughta rest in jesus why hes like jesus in a way ennis mrs lee replied tensely theyre killing him by inches did you see his face look at him she smoothed the wilted paper and looked again at the unsmiling haggard roundlipped face he can change the whole world she said after a time of silent contemplation and he has aged twenty years in a week how horrible it must be to be the target of all that hatred i wonder if it will affect him i wonder if it will inject him i wonder if you or i could have done this thing she continued to study the photograph with her curious interested pitying blue eyes ennis pushed eggshells carefully down the disposal shocked to hermarrow to compare that boy with jesus she offered up a tiny plea for forgiveness mrs lee glancing at ennis suddenly implacable face became aware of a feeling of chill she stood in her bright kitchen and wished that she had not spoken how much better it was to pretend that life was not uncomfortable her own little existence was a delight she owned long days all embellished with frantic rushes to the hairdresser to club meetings to seven pm dinnerparties it would take her three hours to dress when she had a date with her husband for showandsupperintown she spent her leisure hours sunning going to dressfittings and driving in to the elegant jewelry shop to have her pearls restrung mrs lee balled up the newssheet and thrust it into the handsome copper wastebasket perhaps youre right ennis she said i suppose that nothing so basic can ever be changed she longed to say more much more something anything to ask a thousand questions to find logical answers to pierce the natural reticence to understand but simplicity is dead and so she rearmored her heart her awakening heart and put back her reaching hand if you have a moment she said smoothly will you whip up one of your marvelous cakes were having casual company tonight all right ennis murmured she listened to mrs lees pretty mules go tapping away across hardwood floors and she thought what do you know about life livin on cream n peaches the way you do livin in a big house with all kind o help payin eighty dollars for dressfrocks takes me two hard weeks to get me eight o yo dollars grow up in a dirtfloor shack that sleep six on the floor that is life be made a kitchen and laundry slavey when you are seven and learn quickly to move faster than a fist can fly that is life learn intimately all manner of evil that is done by barbaric anglos and africans and think for years that it is the way that life is lived that is life know instinctively the sweet art of making a dollar and a lousy dime do the work of five that is life be matriarch over a clan of weak semijobless males who are always drifting away over the shrill conniving women over the struggling wrathful children who are veering away from all of the old beliefs they come to me they cry to me and im the one who must work and rule and wear this crown of thorns ennis deftly ran a damp mop over the shining floor she picked up the wastebasket put it down and fished out the crumpled newspaper she fitted together the tompieces and stared into the young mans resolute eyes can you make a better life fo my granboy she asked him silently so he wont get filled up wit pain and go out t steal an put lovebabies ill weep

you i is tired an th women like me are tired an its high time you menfolk gave us a han she began to stack away the pretty plates upstairs in her perfumed bath mrs lee let soapsuds gather in the soft water both of them were deep in painful thought relatively young mr lee was not a cruel man he gave lavishly to carefully chosen charities and he paid his taxes with a reasonably willing heart he had broken bread on numerous occasions with orientals and even jews and he often slipped extra dollar bills to ennis thin owleyed grandson when the boy came up on saturday to tidy up the patio however he did not at all share his wifes timidly liberal point of view during breakfast he had snapped the paper as he read the ugly news sneering at the chaotic photographs he had treated ennis with a civil contempt although he did manage to eat four of her delicious biscuits on the train that morning his annoyance was further fanned by conversations he held with his fellow commuters who also dimly viewed the notion of a black ape trying to force his way in where he definitely wasnt wanted they comforted themselves with piously regretful prophecies for they were not unkind men they honestly believed that a nigger should be content with what he possessed because at the most it was so much better than what he might be getting why he could be still dashing about in a jungle someplace mr lee forgot about the outside world when he entered his new office he loved his work he loved mastering the intricacies of engineering and special design and the look of crisp new artwork gave him great pleasure he liked the abstruse clipped language that so confused the layman he hung away his hat and tweed overcoat with one hand and reached for the overflowing in basket with the other the telephone rang almost immediately it was dave lane down in first in personnel dave had an engineer in hand he was sending him up to get squared away qualifications supremely superb lee lane chortled snapped im up names wheeler dont let im get outta the buildin great mr lee told him buy you lunch for that he hung up feeling fine now everything would go along smoothly again he hated it when the office routine was upset he told his secretary to send mr wheeler right in when that gentleman arrived the young man walked with confidence his lean face wore a most expressive noncommittal expression and he walked his full six feet no hunch no slouch on the heels of his dully shined black shoes he wore a neatly understated suit and his tie was impeccable he walked his full six feet down the long aisle that led to mr lees door and the people sitting at the desks looked up then looked again staring some of them narroweyed some of them looked at him with an interest that was not at all malign mr lees secretary smiled up at him im bill wheeler he said handing her a card yes she replied mr lane called us she buzzed her boss mr wheeler has arrived she cooed without further ado she rose and ushered mr wheeler into the inner office the white mans bluish eyes blazed suddenly he recovered in a twinkling and greeted the prospective employee pleasantly taking the cards and folder from his secretary with a small gracious smile sit down mr lee indicated a chair that was pulled up close to his desk billy wheeler is it thank you yes mr wheeler sat down he glanced unobtrusively about him as mr lee studied his papers the room was handsome he looked at mr lee middlingofage receding hair of good stock odorless a good tailor practiced bland eye the silence grew you have been busy mr lee said as he turned over a paper or two he looked up at bill wheeler smiling he leaned back in his comfortable chair and picked up a pencil we are at present engaged in a variety of programs mr wheeler all infinitely important we are concerned with design technological processes specification review we study the theory of estimation multivariate analysis decision theorywere a tight little group up here and we all work very hard do you think that you would be willing to work weekends and late at nighti know how you like your saturday nights ha ha as do we all he thought in fury what the devil does dave mean sending a dinge up here aloud he went on smiling ever work with principal scientists i was with a company that employed them mr wheeler answered showing his teeth also we got along famously uhhum mr lee tapped the folder once with his very sharp pencil you were in civil service he looked at wheeler yes bill wheeler said its all there in the resume sir but i wish to grow with a company well were considering everyone of course mr lee told him brightly pulling open a desk drawer and extracting a sheaf of papers i have several other applicants that id like to confer with ill call you mr lane the guy in personnel mr wheeler pointed to a card that mr lee had ignored im to receive instructions from you he hired me mr wheeler relaxed and took his gloves off im to start monday mr wheeler added mr lee felt the red blood swell his temples caution fled and the rage boiled over hed see lane about this later when he spoke though his voice was gentle he could have been speaking to a child why do you wish to work here we dont want any troublesome of our most capable employees might quit and the company couldnt afford that the position is exactly what ive been looking for bill wheeler told him im close to my home the salarys real good theres room for advancement and i want a job where i can work my mind to its capacity sir ive got a lot of good ideas but ive felt stifledid like to be more creative or somewhat creativeanyway this company has the tools that i need and ive got what the company wants he laughed a little i can even advise you on the transcient behavior of various types of stochastic processes mr lee smiled not he simply sat and looked at the man the man talked like a white man he vore clothes like one he exuded selfconfidence like a white man who knew his trade the nigger seemed completely unaware of the very evident fact that he was not a white man mr lee looked at the closed folder the references were marvelous the nigger qualified god damn it have you tried any other employers mr lee pleaded he simply had to try your companys equal opportunity i believe mr wheeler said coldly i wish to work here oh yes mr lee shifted in his chair i didnt mean to imply that we did not hire your group but i had talked to someone else and i have not yet had the opportunity to inform mr lane how can that be sir in an outfit the size of this one i know that the avenues of communcation are better arranged than that would mr lane hire him he would on my sayso mr lee working with absolute stats and mathematical procedures ought by now to have given you a horror of equivocation weve never had negroes here any ever apply none ever qualified i qualify there is more to the position than that mr wheeler there are the personal relationships we often have little gettogethers youd feel uncomfortable and so would the others for their freedom ofspeech would be somewhat curtailed you understand so many places do hire your group and ive noticed that they also form their own little cliques you wouldnt have a thing in common with anyone here and the company outingssome tactless remarkyou have probably experienced iti do want to see your kind get ahead mr wheeler but i simply do not think that you would fit in here mr wheeler grinned faintly im not intimidated mr lee i have used knowledge as a wedge to open many and many a door it is penetrating selfenriching and it works you dont have to like me personally sir when you give me an order close your eyes mr wheelers voice was quietthere was even a tiny ripple of laughter accompanying his last words the vast forces in that tastefully furnished room were leashed but the thread was thin i have become hopelessly assimilated into your world sir i worship your god i have educated myself i have learned to care for bach and picasso i am a student of euclid your culture such as it is is mine it is all ive ever known and what else could i have done if you will take your heel off my neck i will show you what i can accomplish you swarm all over everything mr lee cried losing control his soul in torment and blacken the world maybe we are smart mr wheeler mused thoughtlessly i think that is why you fear us so he looked into mr lees bluish eyes carlyle once asserted that mans business was not to see what lies ahead but to do what lies at hand we blacks are realizing that we are going to have to do what lies at hand because your tomorrow for us isnt ever gonna come bill wheeler leaned forward his dark eyes living wells of light why cant you see that it has to be we cannot regress sir my little boy is wholly americani didnt mean to say thatbut mr lee it isnt your world any more there are more like me coming and im afraid that you are simply gonna have to get used to the idea wheeler spread his hands and looked down at them there are more like me coming mr lees eyes remained fixed on bill wheelers face he was remembering a scrap of conversation that he had heard in a plush bar one night he remembered a man saying shortsighted ancestors left us with a problem now that the white mans burden is being shed whatre we gonna do for an encore and someone had said its inevitable isnt it and somebody else had spoken slowly viciously with quiet emphasis i think that well pull all civilization down around our ears first id light the first fuse gladly id set off a thousand hundredmegatons for i would rather die and rot unburied in the ruins of this earth than accept a negro as my equal mr lee stared at mr wheeler and he said to him do you think for one moment you shadow of a white man that i am going to help you take it away from me do you actually believe that i who waded hipdeep through blood and tears for centuries am going to stoop to give you a hand up do you really believe that i who perfected the arts of warring and living would willingly share the good of it all with you do you think that i want to share my verandah in the cool of evening with you in the cool of evening i want you there to bring my drink and fetch my slippers and i want to own the right to boot you off the place if i so desire and i will kill you to keep the privilege so said mr lee evenly and even gently in panic and out of a deeper emotion than even pain he added i have seen my women looking at you out of the corners of their eyes and there lay spoken the final truth mr wheeler looked at the pale implacable face he stood he held himself tightly for he wished to smash and destroy mr lee said into the silence i have hired an engineer i forgot to inform mr lane i am sorry we will of course keep your name on file the two of them regarded each other nakedly for a long and brittle moment after bill wheeler had gone away mr lee sat on trying to control the trembling of his hands and legs if we educate them and treat them as though they are as good as white men they will smear us from the earth with their vitalitythey are so alive he swung about in his comfortable chair and looked through the big window down into the busy street it was good out there good for a man a white man the plattersized steaks in the smoky darkpanelled restaurants where the help was black and devoured their meat in the kitchen the long blonde women who stalked upon slender legs costing a man plenty sometimes even a marriage the tall bright trim buildings that housed the technological machinery that white men had invented the sweet expensive resorts the mountain lodges the country clubs where the grass was so greenly groomed and where the sunlight sparkled on the turquoise water in the heated pools the skiing holes the money the fine old traditions the homes that were so big and lovely no god forbid oh blessed white god forbid it we can emphasize education mr lee thought maybe that will stop them maybe they wont be able to pursue us up this technological mountain if this wont work well then well just have to revert back to the stone age and declare war on them all all in that split second which followed his morbid cornered thought he realized dully and with a shrinking heart that they were going to have to yield the only alternative was violence and utter chaos the telephone jangled at his elbow startled he turned and looked at it grimly he turned about and yanked up the receiver epilogue bill said mr lee heres the info you wantedall herelisten you hear about the two new colored fellas they hired yesterday bill wheeler looked up in surprise no he replied smiling and accepting the datasheet thats swell well retorted mr lee sourly i just hope it works out i worked out murmured bill regarding his boss with his usual expression of gentle irony you growled mr lee you well hell youyoure different bill wheeler hunched over his work and mr lee stalked away grumbling happily to himself and after a little time one lone salted heartwrenched bitter wondering exasperated tear fell upon the pristine beauty of billy wheelers board a portfolio of african art text by denise paulme eneral awareness of negro art in all its forms music the plastic arts literature dates back to the years immediately following the first world war in london in paris jazz with its african ancestry conquered the musicians in may the devambez gallery organized in paris the first exhibition of african and oceanian sculpture in the editions de las sirene published the anthologie negre of blaise cendrars which brought together myths stories and proverbs of the african native in the same year the april issue no of the review action edited by florent fels presented views on negro art of wellknown artists and writers picasso juan gris jacques lipshitz cocteau andre salmon jean pellerinwhile from guillaume apollinaire who had died in november came an extract from the article in the mercure de france where in april he had devoted two pages to the fetichist sculpture of the black races these testimonies were not all eulogistic the dealer paul guillaume saw in african sculpture the quickening seed of the spiritual twentieth century but jean cocteau affirmed that the negro crisis in art has become as big a bore as mallarmes faponisme disparate views indeed but views from which one gleans the impression of a convergence between african plastic art and certain aspects of western art of that period in fact negro sculpture was first hailed as an art form by a group of painters living in paris at the beginning of this centuryvlaminck matisse and derain among others who frequented the galleries of the old trocadero while in london derain spent much time in the ethnographic department of the british museum in brussels a magnificent collection startingpoint of the museum of the belgian congo had been assembled for the exhibition and has been on public view ever since among these souvenirs de voyage these curios artists who would one day be described as fauves and cubists discovered a new art form whose echo seemed to respond to what they themselves struggled to express in the henri matisse collection included twenty or so negro statues derain braque and picasso were now the possessors of african masks at the same time a parallel movement began in germany in the painters kandinsky and franz marc issued their blue rider in munich here side by side with the works of picasso matisse cezanne gaugin appeared childrens sketches glasspaints medieval carvings chinese paintings etc evoked by gauguin the south seas was again represented by a statuette from easter island a mask from new caledonia also a woodcarving from the cameroons a plaque from benin and a mask from gaboon two years earlier in the berlin of there had appeared the black decameron of frobenius a miscellany of african myth and legend the work was quite beautifully written it not only commanded the respect of the specialist in negro art but also attracted the attention of people of culture throughout the west music plastic arts literature from onwards africa was no longer the forgotten continent its existence was recognized along with intimations of the riches it was to reveal the first volume of aesthetics devoted to african sculpture was the negerplastik of carl einstein published in einstein saw in negro statuary a profound and archetypal significance something worthy to inspire the modem artist overinfluenced by painting western sculpture had reached an impasse african sculpture according to einstein resolved the fundamental problem of the expression of volume of mass african sculpture alone in his view was true sculpture breaking with all academic formulas and reacting against the mannered impressionists which resulted in pictures where everything became dissolved in a cloud of coloured dust both fauves and cubists sensed the urge to forge a new style in search of signposts they turned towards negro art a term which for a long period embraced the divergent sculptures of africa and oceaniain much the same way that the impressionists before them had turned to the far east they in their turn sought above all else to find in the primitive arts arguments to justify their flight from convention negro art with its highlycommunicable sense of mass furnished the example of a tradition which its disciples claimed to be viable it offered too as bait the attraction of novelty it answered the taste for the exotic naive barbaric these adjectives exalted the souls of amateurs who cared little for the exact source of the work in question still less for its initial impulse and meaning in the hands of the artist it is due to the research of ethnographers well schooled in the art of their period that for the past twenty years african sculpture has been given a richer deeper signifi cance they have been able to assign each single work to the period and community which gave it life as well as explaining its function its method of usage and its symbolic values the importance of the religious factor in all aesthetic activity of the african cannot be exaggerated means and ends integral parts are all imbued by this consideration to set out to judge a mask or statue of the african continent purely on the aesthetic planewilfully ignoring the artists motive forceis not less absurd than to pretend to study medieval sculpture while disregarding christianity such ethnographical museums as house the most important collections of african and oceanic art strive nowadays to adapt themselves to this double necessity they would be failing in their function if they were not also museums of art their choicest specimensa benin ivory for example a baule mask a baluba caryatidare invariably isolated from the rest placed at an angle and in a light which seems best suited to reveal their form and balance although it may not be essential to understand its precise significance in order to appreciate the form which is given to a piece of sculpture it is not unimportant to realize that african masks with rare exceptions are a male prerogative from which women are kept rigidly excluded in a number of societies myth attributes the in vention of masks to a woman who steals the disguises abandoned by demons the menfolk then proceed to seize them regarding the masks the symbols of poweras the sole means of enabling them to exert over their wives the superiority essential to the maintenance of social order the variety which we observe in the masks is explained by their purpose the effect of terror will sometimes be secured by a stylization where human elements blend with zoomorphic ones eg monkey buffalo and antelopemasks sometimes by an exaggeration accompanied by a simplification of facial planes sometimes again by a juxtaposition of colours of symbolic significance adjacent to these terrifying exhibits there are others which aim solely to entertain and relax the viewer it so happens that these comic masks appear on the heels of their horrific neighbours providing a breathingspace which has been judged to be necessary but the uninitiated critic who is ignorant of this division will judge both the one and the other impartially as being either beautiful or monstrous one statuette may evoke the memory of an ancestor while its neighbours mission is to protect its master against everterrifying black magic always to be feared yet another is acting a role in a ceremony of divination the last may be a dollone of a pair of twins and during his lifetime the survivor will feed wash and dress the statuettean image of his dead brother it is all this that the museum strives to evoke with the exception of certain pieces which have been deliberately isolated the emphasis in each case is on the role played by the sculpture in the society in which it has its origins finally it would be absurd to suppose that all specimens are of equal value within a series originating from the same region the level appears to be more or less highthe masterpiece is always unique a single visit to a great museum is enough to show the differences which distinguish pieces from the same source or more or less derived from the same inspiration and obedient to the same stylistic exigencies w fagg who studied the present day yoruba sculptors in southern nigeria remarks on the aesthetic consciousness evinced as much by artisans as the patrons who order works from them a great sculptor can ask a higher price than the others and often gets commissions from distant towns and even regions where another style prevails recap on a dread disease by myron c golton young mothertobe a lay on her back at the cook county hospital in chicago the doctor could see she was doing poorly ive had chills for the past week doctor she said tonelessly with a seeming resignation to pain and suffering she coughed it was not a hard cough but the effect was apparent her hand went instinctively to her right side to cup the pain in her chest slowly she turned to spit out the white sticky mucous hows the baby going to come out all right a worrying fretful note appeared in her voice appears to be okay answered the doctor glad to be on a cheerful topic he was worried about the mother though her attacks of pains in the jointsthey were like rheumatic fever but were they something else was there in the background in her past medical history he was puzzled the picture was not complete it was like a cutout puzzle with pieces missing the offsounds when he tested her right chest could be pneumonia he made a written note of it there were other physical signs that bode no good yet her urine and blood hurriedly tested revealed little at halfpast ten in the morning she went into labor come on baby the world is waiting for you shell be proud of you be you boy orgirl what mother would not be chesty showing off her first child all this preliminary agony would be forgotten an hour later the poor little unborn parcel stopped sending out heart tone signals to the doctor tuning in with his shiny instrument no sense in telling the mother she was having a hard enough time of it she did not know soon enough better get on with the business and easy does it easy easy the way was not easy and the time was not short it was more hours long tossing straining crying hours before the baby was born for the baby it was late much too late for the mother it looked almost too late also she hung on desperately to that faint spark of life while they toiled around her trying to fan it to a blaze again six hours later the mother joined the baby when a postmortem examination was performed on the mother it was found that her red blood cells were long and whiplike in shape indicating that both she and her baby were victims of the dread disease sickle cell anemia the history of this case goes back years to the time when the mother was herself a tiny infant just letting out her first cry to the outside world if some medic had taken a drop of her blood that first day of her life and smeared it flat across a glass slide and peered at it magnified many times under a microscope he could have foreseen the tragic future but probably he too would have felt the helplessness of it for in those days sickle cell anemia was a medical territory virtually unexplored no one knew exactly what to do about it even today prospects are not too bright for this hereditary disease which is so peculiar to negroes and rarely ever found among whites as high as in every negroes examined have been found to have the oddly formed red blood cells which also take the shape of a crescent or a holly wreath sickle cell anemia was first detected years ago at a free dispensary on chicagos west side while dr james b herrick was examining a young west indian a medical student who complained of weakness and loss of weight even today the disease is occasionally referred to as herricks disease normal red blood cells when floating through the body are shaped somewhat like a cupped hand placed under a microscope they resemble a collection of nickels or a stack of poker chips viewed edgewise they are barshaped with a swelling at top and bottom researchers have found that the inner pressure of oxygen keeps the cells puffed up to their natural shape in fact it is this oxygen pressure that furnishes the key to the difference between a normal and a sickle cell reducing the pressure they have discovered transforms the cells from normal to sickle this is important but there is much more to solving the mystery of the strange behavior of the blood looking for more information researchers roland b scott robert p crawford and melvin jenkins all doctors at howard university examined hundreds of negro infants at freedmans hospital in washington d c they found that the blood of only per cent of the babies carried the ominous sickle cells when they examined older children however they found the percentage to be more than twice as high evidently the presence of these cells becomes more apparent or more numerous as the child grows older studying sickle cell traits among pregnant colored women doctors paul k switzer and heyward h fouche found that the disease usually appears before a woman is years old once started it never lets up in fact it continues to aggravate ruthlessly dogging its victim to an early grave women with the disease have less children and are more prone to abortions researchers who examined pregnant negro women at roper hospital in charleston south carolina found that one out of every seven possessed the sickle cells in their blood yet the study failed to disclose any ill effects three chicago doctors alfred j kobak philip j stein and august f daro considered the problem extremely grave during pregnancy they discovered many cases of the disease among negro women in the maternity wards at cook county hospital women who were thin and underdeveloped whose past medical history revealed frequent attacks of pneumonia and other respiratory infections who complained of joint and muscle and abdominal pains with nausea and vomiting usually were infected with sickle cell anemia many of the patients also suffered with leg ulcers and jaundice fellow doctors who practice in other hospitals and rarely come across the disease were advised to suspect it even though the symptoms indicated rheumatic fever tuberculosis syphilis or some other form of anemia when women infected with sickle cell anemia become pregnant they are fortunate if the baby is delivered successfully all too often it ends in abortion or stillbirth the doctor must watch the mothers health chart constantly when the deadly shock comes signaling a sudden interruption in the vital blood flow within the body the medic must work and think fast for he knows then that the oddshaped cells have formed clumps which have clogged up the liver and bottlenecked the normal flow of blood through arteries and veins this grave problem received special attention at cook county hospital choosing his words carefully obstetrician alfred j kobak said i do not believe the disease is necessarily increasing rather would say we see more of it because we look for it at cook county hospital when a negro patient shows clinical evidence of anemia special efforts are made to determine the presence of sickling in his red blood cells when asked if other cities were affected as much as chicago he answered that inasmuch as it was almost entirely a disease of the negro wherever a large segment of the population is nonwhite one can expect a comparable increase in the number of cases said dr kobak there is nothing in the diet of the negro which might encourage sickle cell anemia i have found it among the wealthy as well as the poor if you have the disease he warned see your doctor immediately lead a guarded life rest often make sure you have a high calorie diet together with plenty of vitamins and iron any time there are intercurrent infections such as colds see your doctor at once you are especially the kind of person who cannot take chances with any threat to your health for relief i recommend blood replacements and long periods of rest anything that tends to bolster up resistance is helpful medics have known for some time that sickle cell anemia is hereditary and not contagious but what is the latest information on the subject what is medical science doing about this dread disease in an effort to answer these questions i visited the worldfamous medical research institute of the michael reese hospital in chicago there i interviewed dr karl singer head of the department of hematologic research where studies go on constantly in efforts to crack all the recondite mysteries within that fluid we term blood dr singer told me that sickle cell anemia is by no means a rare disease in fact he said next to leukemia it is the most prominent blood disease at the michael reese clinic alone we have about cases under treatment all the time he estimated that there are negroes in the united states who carry the sickle cells in their bodies fortunately not all of these people become ill there are two classes those who have the sickle cell trait and those who have the disease the first group carries the sickle cells in its blood but does not seem to suffer any ill effects the second group carries the sickle cells and suffers from the disease too dr singer estimates that a total of to people in this country come under the latter classification it strikes both sexes alike in the laboratories of the research institute after years of trial they have finally evolved a simple test to detect the presence of the peculiar shaped cells mixing a drop of blood with a drop of a certain chemical on a glass slide they wait a short time and then look through the microscope in from five to minutes sickle cellsif present will appear what chance does a baby have of inheriting the disease if both parents are affected said dr singer there is a per cent chance of each of their children being affected also what of the future dr singer drew some interesting and startling conclusions medical science has made great strides since sickle cell anemia was pointed out by dr herrick in now a patient has a much greater chance of weathering the storms of the disease doctors are aware of the problem and medicines and knowledge are abundant crises can be anticipated and patients protected from dangerous infections men and women with sickle cell anemia formerly were forced out of the normal streams of life by their ill health their life span was short they naturally were not desirable marriage mates and so did not bear as many children as did normal healthy people women with the disease when they did have pregnancies had far less live babies than normal mothers the tendency then was for sickle cell anemia to disappear although the process was slow now however the picture is reversed doctors with antibiotics and modern knowledge of diets and general care enable these patients to live more nearly normal lives they will be living longer more of them will be marrying more of their babies will be born alive these things are all to the good but the link of heredity is an iron one whose secrets are still mostly mysteries to science sickle cells will be passed on to more and more children who will in turn grow up in increasing numbers to propagate more children it is a great public health problem it threatens to be greater in recognition of their important work and to further their studies the public health service awarded the medics at michael reese hospital a huge grant of money to finance continuing vital blood research at that institution there is a special laboratory for research in blood diseases where they are now intensifying studies in leukemia and sickle cell anemia it is hoped says dr singer that by studying these blood diseases general knowledge will accumulate which may aid in the study of many other related diseases the boys and girls of snick by howard zinn aving just spent a little time in greenwood miss i felt a c certain air of unreality a out the march on washington the grandiose speeches the array of movie stars the big names dropped and bounced several times the sheer impress of numbersall added up technically to an occasion that one describes as thrilling and it must have been so to participants and to the millions who watched on television still while swept up in the spirit myself i wondered if to the negro citizen of greenwood itta bena and ruleville of albany americus and dawson of selma gadsden and birmingham of danville and other places it may not have seemed the most gargantuan and best organized of irrelevancies there was one relevant moment in the days events at washington that was when the youngest speaker on the platform john lewis chairman of the student nonviolent coordinating committee lashed out in anger not only at the dixiecrats but at the kennedy administration which had been successful up to that moment in directing the indignation of people at everyone but itself the depth of lewis feeling and the direction of his attack may have baffled northern liberals mollified recently by the administrations new civil_rights bill by its bold words and by the presidents endorsement of the great march but john lewis knew because the young sncc workers in his organization are on the front lines of the conflict that while the president and the attorney general speak loud in washington their voices are scarcely whispers in the towns and the hamlets of the black belt greenwood miss just before the march revealed in its own quiet way how the deep south remains essentially untouched by resonant speeches in the national capital surrounded by cotton plantations greenwood overlooks the delta from a vantage point in westcentral mississippi it is the headquarters for the voter registration project in which all the major civilrights organizations cooperate and whose working force is supplied mainly by the youngsters of the student nonviolent coordinating committee snccaffectionately called snick it is the seat of leflore county where negroes are per cent of the population and half the negro families have an income less than a week almost no negroes vote and attempts of the past year to register negroes have been met with torch shotgun and a dozen varieties of official brutality intimidation and subterfuge the snick office in greenwood is like a front company headquarters during wartime as i came in one evening last august having driven from memphis i was greeted by annelle ponder whose younger sister i taught at spelman college in atlanta and whose path has crossed mine several times in the last few hectic years the ponder girls are all tall blackskinned and beautiful annelle has been in greenwood this past year handling the southern christian leadership conferences part of the voter registration project she is quiet and courageous she has been beaten by police in winona miss when friends went to the jail one day they found her sitting there her face swollen and marked barely able to speak she looked up at them and just managed to whisper one word freedom with annelle at headquarters were a bunch of the snick kids one of them came forward to shake hands and we recognized each otherit was stokely carmichael a tall slender philosophy student at howard university born in the west indies and reared in the sitin movement we had met in albany ga during the first outburst of trouble there in december i what was on for the evening a mass meeting at one of the negro churches and then a party at the home of one of the girls they showed my wife and me around the building on the first floor a big jumbled room for meetings with a long table in the center this was the dining room too for whatever voter registration workers were around when mealtime cameand a small kitchen to the side where mrs johnson cooked the meals upstairs were cubicles serving as offices and a large area with two iron cots in a corner for travelers in the movement cartons of books were on the floor they had been donated by a northern college and were soon to go on new pine bookshelves at the church meeting middleaged negroes who had lived forty and fifty years in the delta without shaking a white persons hand came up to shake hands and say hello greenwood has this past year been going through that tense hopeful process begun recently in many communities of the deep souththe first contact on an equal basis with white people an awakening to the possibility of genuine brotherhood these first white friends have been college students from new england or ministers from the middle west or just interested people passing throughrather than local whites but it is a start and among the snick youngsters manning battle posts in the black belt have been young white southerners bob zellner from alabama sandra hayden from texas it is a beginning and credit belongs mostly to the student nonviolent coordinating committee for blasting open in various parts of the deep south the first pockets of equal interracial contact for southern whites watching at the edge of these pockets it is a painful but inexorable educational process the first reactions to the sight of negroes and whites in friendly contact are outrage fury often violence but repetition of the vision dulls the reflex and there begins not acceptance yet but at least hesitancy perhaps greenwood police this past year have begun to move into the second stage when a police car stopped my wife and me as we were driving away from the snick party they seemed at least a little accustomed to the idea they flashed their lights again and again into our faces and into the car and cast looks at the house where the lights were on and the noise of the party could still be heard they spent some time examining identification papers and then unlike a previous similar experience in atlanta where my companion was a negro and we were arrested muttered for us to move on the next afternoon a race against time began among the snick workers in the greenwood office thirteen youngsters were in parchman state prison farm and had been there for two months fortyfive other negroesmen and women of all ageshad been on the county prison farm also for two months all of them had been arrested in june on charges of breach of the peace after much legal delay release was at hand a young lawyer representing the national council of churches had come to greenwood with bond money for these fiftyeight people but it turned out that information supplied him by local officials and transcribed on the bonds was full of errors and the county attorney would not accept the bonds if the transaction could not be completed by that friday afternoon the prisoners would have to spend another weekend in jail the proper information was quickly compiled and all available typewriters and people who could type were assembled in the voter registration project office the new data were typed in the papers were taken to the sheriff just before dusk on friday the fiftyeight emerged the headquarters that night had the eerie quality of a field hospital after a battle youngsters out of jailsixteen and seventeen years oldwere sprawled here and there two of them lay on the narrow cots upstairs where a few of the snick girls dabbed their eyes with boric acid solutions some dietary deficiency in jail had affected their eyes one boy nursed an infected hand another boys foot was swollen he had started to lose feeling in it while in the hot box at parchman and had stamped on it desperately again and again to restore circulation medical attention was refused them in prison the cold newspaper reports of the past few years about people arrested in various parts of the deep south for demonstrating have never conveyed the reality of a black belt jail three snick

at first my mother didnt want me to be in it then she realized it would be best for her and for me if i were in the movement so she told me i could go ahead and work in the movement while the returned prisoners took turns lying on the bunks snick workers were being delivered to different parts of the negro section of greenwood to announce a mass meeting that night to welcome the prisoners back home you find roughly three kinds of snick workers in a place like greenwood two or three regular staff members who make or a weekin those weeks when there is money ten to fifteen students from various parts of the country who have left school temporarily to work with snick and who subsist on or perhaps every other week indeterminate numbers of young people from the town and the surrounding countryside who volunteer their time risk their lives and their liberty and get an occasional meal at headquarters i sat in on the staff meeting next morning held in the large main room in one corner was a boiler in another a rubbish can on the walls were a map of the city of greenwood newspaper clippings on civil_rights photos of pete seeger when he was in greenwood photos of jim forman executive secretary of snick scattered around were two typewriters some broken chairs books and newspapers and a big pot for koolaid but if poverty showed in the material possessions at snick headquarters the human resources were something else chairing the meeting was bob moses the quiet fighter in charge of the voter registration project a veteran by now of mississippi violence and nonviolence here was sam block silent thin dark his home deep in the delta who did the early reconnaissance for snick in the area and almost lost his life for it here was willie peacock also from mississippi another snick veteran annelle ponder was here representing sclc martin_luther_kings group martha prescod a slender college student from the north stokely carmichael the fiery young man from howard jean wheeler a smiling coed also from howard here too was a former star student of mine at spelman collegeher home a little town in south carolinanow just graduated from yale law school marian wright with her was another graduate from yale a young white fellow named oscar chase chase recently wrote a valuable legal paper which shows how the federal government by bold imaginative use of the injunction could fulfill its responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of negroes in the deep south in the room also was another of the increasing number of white college students in this essentially negroled movementa california sociology major named mike miller who has done impressive research on civilrights matters and five of the youngsters just out of parchman jail were present that afternoon we drove in two cars to itta bena a feudal cotton village outside greenwood where negroes came off the land to meet in a dilapidated little church welcome back the parchman prisoners and sing freedom songs with an overpowering spirit one of the returned prisoners was mother perkins fragile and small seventyfive years old who had just spent like the rest two months on the county prison farm for wanting to register cars filled with white men rumbled by along the road that passed by the church door but the meeting and the singing went on anyone who felt the urge got up and spoke an old man rose on his cane and said all these years going along behind my plow i thought some day things would change but i never dreamed id see it now bob moses told them that negroesand whiteswere without jobs in all the big cities of the nation that they could not run away any more from the delta to chicago and detroit that they must stay and wrench from the state of mississippi what they deserved as human beings marian wright told them a fable about an eagle that for a long time was told it was a chicken and believed it stokely carmichael reminded them that while the lord might be on their side they would have to secure their rights by their own intense efforts meanwhile the automobiles kept passing on the road outside the crushing conclusion that comes out of greenwood miss and selma ala and danville va and americus gais that the federal government is but a shadow in the hardrock places of the deep south standing at the foot of the lincoln memorial john lewis turned his wrath not at the easy target the dixiecrats but against the administration it is the federal government that indicted nine of our people in albany the democratic party lewis made clear cannot be treated as a savior as long as it lives with eastland nor can the republicans harboring goldwater what political leader can stand up and say his party is the party of freedom and then the most dangerous question one can ask in a country boasting of its twoparty system where is our party to many the march had been presented as a gigantic lobby for the administrations civil_rights bill but lewis pointed quickly unerringly to the weaknesses in the bill furthermore by sponsoring a new civilrights bill the administration had skillfully turned attention to congress and deflected the erratic spotlight of the civilrights movement from possibly focusing on inadequacies of the executive the straight crass fact at which john lewis was aiming is this the national government without any new legislation has the power to protect negro voters and demonstrators from policemens clubs hoses and jailsand it has not used that power despite the welcome new words of concern by the kennedy administration despite several dozen suits filed by the justice department in voting cases the negro in the deep south still stands alone and unprotected as he tries to eat in a bus terminal register to vote or hand out a leaflet on a street corner the right to vote and freedom of expression are not in themselves solutions to the fundamental problem which is a rearranging of economic and political power in the south but they are prerequisites to that rearrangement there is a constitutional rock to which the executive branch can tie its lines and then smash with all the pover at its command every wallace every barnett every chief pritchett every commander lingo every bull connor who ever begins to lift a billy club at an american citizen exercising his constitutional rights that is the supreme courts statement in the debs case of the entire strength of the nation may be used to enforce in any part of the land the full and free exercise of all national powers and the security of all rights entrusted by the constitution to its care but to act on that dictum calls for certain traits which the administration has thus far not shown imaginativeness in the use of the courts boldness in the exercise of executive power the courage to set new precedents in federal relations the willingness to bypass congress on an issue about which congress spoke its mind in when it passed the fourteenth amendment above all it means changing to the offensive up to now the administration has simply reacted to every racial crisis southern officials have thrown thousands of people into jail and then put the burden on the civilrights movement to get them out the national government needs to act and then put the burden on southern segregationists to revoke the action let them wrestle with courts raise money for trial plead for toleration the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment the supreme courts statement in the debs case the declaration of section of the us penal code that any official who deprives a person of his constitutional rights has committed a federal crime these are the alreadyexisting legal bases for executive action that action requires first stationing all over the south hundreds of federal agents replacing the fbi which is incompetent in the field of civil_rights to protect the constitutional rights of negroes these agents would have the specific assignment and the authority granted by the president to jail any local official who violates the constitution at the same time the president must begin fillingas he has failed to do so farthe federal judgeships of the deep south with persons committed to the principle of equality regardless of the wishes of the regions senators among the outworn political institutions of this nation is that of senatorial courtesy which requires kennedy to consult eastland in the appointment of a federal judge in mississippi talmadge and russell in georgia the shattering of precedent can start here then a combination of quickacting federal agents and determined judges can begin to rivet into the mind of the deep south and into the mind of the nation not that negroes are equal that will take time but that if they are not treated equally the consequences will be swift and harsh when ten core and sncc people white and negro walked into alabama to try to establish what bill moore at the cost of his life had failed to establishthe right to walk safely on a public highwaya cordon of federal marshals should have surrounded them and when alabama safety director a lingo showed up with his electric prod poles and guns he should have been taken immediately into federal custody the burden of legal proof needs to be borne by the segregationists and this has not yet been done any good lawyer knows that the advantage is in the hands of the man who moves first that delay and bureaucracy and legal complications all work against those who are trying to undo an action yet the civilrights movement which cannot help it and the justice department which can have been on the defensive the needed initiative is not likely to come from a government whose dedication to racial equality is as circumspect as that of the kennedy brothers it took a series of explosive crises throughout the nation to force from them words of moral concern that became part of the constitution a hundred years ago it took something close to a revolution to bring forth a moderate civilrights bill which will be further moderated by congress and by segregationists federal judges and by a cautious justice department basic changes are needed in the social structure of the nation before meaningful racial equality can be established but in the deep south a prerequisite for such changes is the establishment of the right to vote to organize to speak write and assemble freely and without fear of violence that requires a radical new use of initiative and power by the national government and because the administration and inherently any administration lacks the internal motivation for such a seizure of initiative it will have to be prodded by the increased use of nonviolent direct action right now those who see this most clearly feel it most intensely and are best prepared to move on it are the young people in the student nonviolent coordinating committee a centennial evaluation by rayford w logan he evaluation of the promise of emancipation like that of other promissory notes must calculate the intent of the signer the consideration expected of or given by the promisees the face and hidden values the added dividends and finally the payments by the promisees and the balance due them the most important controversy concerning lincolns intent in emancipating the slaves stems from his answer to an editorial by horace greeley in the new york tribune august greeley had chided the president for his alleged failure fully to execute the terms of the second confiscation act june which declared that the slaves of any person convicted of treason should go free on august lincoln wrote to greeley i would save the union i would save it the shortest way under the constitution the sooner the national authority can be restored the nearer the union will be the union it was if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time save slavery i do not agree with them if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery i do not agree with them my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save this union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union i shall do less whenever i shall believe what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views i have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty and i intend no modification of my oftexpressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free those who gleefully quote this negro digest december letter in their efforts to prove that lincoln did not at that time plan to square his personal wish with his official duty overlook convincing evidence that he had already resolved in his own mind this dilemma early in july lincoln had already begun to compose the first draft of an emancipation proclamation on july he made known to two members of his cabinet his intention to prepare the draft on july almost a month before greeleys editorial the president submitted to his cabinet a tentative draft of an emancipation proclamation lincoln wisely delayed publication of this preliminary emancipation proclamation until a union victory would discredit partially at least those who asserted that the abolition of slavery in the rebel states was dictated by the need to enlist the former slaves against their former masters the union forces achieved a sufficient victory on september at antietam sharpsburg md and compelled the confederates to retreat across the potomac five days later lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation it stated that on january all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforward and forever free since the southern states rejected this olive branch of september lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation on january the proclamation made two promises first that the slaves in the states and parts of states in rebellion against the united states should be then thenceforward and forever free second that former slaves would be used as garrison troops and on naval vessels against their former masters and thus would have the right and responsibility to fight for their own freedom in the legal sense this military service was not a consideration not a quid pro quo for emancipation lincoln did not require nor had the slaves offered this service in return for emancipation but free negroes not only leaders like frederick douglass but also the rank and file interpreted it as a consideration they had previously encountered inertia legal and political obstacles and evasion when they had sought to enlist after january they so insistently demanded the right to fight for freedom that less than four weeks after the proclamation secretary of war stanton authorized governor john a andrew of massachusetts to enlist negro volunteers these northern negroes were fighting not only for the physical emancipation of slaves in the south they were fighting for their own freedom which an ultimate confederate victorystill not impossible at the beginning of would have jeopardized negroes thus interpreted the emancipation proclamation as a right and responsibility to share with other americans in the quest for freedom this was not a new interpretation negroes had helped to preserve the freedom of colonists from attacks by indians and frenchmen crispus attucks had been the first to fall in the socalled boston massacre despite initial opposition free and slave negroes had fought and died in the battles of the revolutionary war from bunker hill to yorktown negro sailors under perry at putinbay and soldiers in jacksons army at new orleans had contributed to victory in the second war for independence the war of a small number had helped to liberate from mexican rule california and the territories of new mexico and utah the acquisition of which had precipitated the renewal of the issue of slavery or freedom in all the territories the emancipation proclamation therefore gave negroes a right and responsibility to do for themselves what they had long done for others other values than this right and responsibility were less evident on january one was the promise of freedom to negroes in haiti and liberia from ostracism by the family of nations though this promise was hidden i believe that there was a clear reciprocal relationship between the emancipation of american negro slaves and lincolns recognition of haiti and liberia let us return to the crucial year on june congress passed a law abolishing slavery in all the other territories when lincoln signed this bill he had achieved a goal the pursuit of which at one time had threatened to destroy his political career abolition of slavery in the territories had constituted one of the main themes of his house divided speech at springfield illinois june the month of june witnessed another triumph for lincoln on june he signed the bill for the appointment of the first diplomatic representative of the united states to haiti to be sure this victory over the slaveholders and their northern allies had not tormented lincoln during his lonely watches at night as excruciatingly as had the question of slavery in the territories but opposition to the recognition of haiti had antedated opposition to the suppression of the african slave trade and the most bitter debates over the right of congress to abolish slavery in the territories since emancipation in the border states emancipation in the district of columbia the acknowledgment of the independence of haiti and liberiaand i would add the treaty for the suppression of the african slave trade as well as the law abolishing slavery in all the territoriesindicated lincolns purpose to carry forward in sumners words the principles of the declaration of independence the emancipation proclamation gave further evidence of this purpose one of the greatest constitutional lawyers from john marshall to john marshall harlan the farseeing nineteenthcentury dissenter lincoln realized that the legality of the emancipation proclamation would be challenged he therefore prodded the republican national convention of and congress until the latter voted in to send to the states a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery throughout the united states the job was of course not ended even after the ratification of the thirteenth amendment the southern states adopted new black codes designed to circumvent the amendment none of them gave the freedmen the right to vote the restoration of white control in the south after led douglass to remark in that he had long regarded the elective franchise as the one great power by which all other civil_rights are obtained douglasss initial fears were so compounded that by the time of his death in the promise of emancipation seemed almost an empty dream the ratification of the fourteenth amendment of the fifteenth amendment and the passage of the civil_rights act temporarily revived hopes of cynical and sanguine observers but the civil_rights decision which limited the application of the fourteenth amendment to states disillusioned them negroes suffered another cruel blow in december on the twentysecond henry w grady delivered at delmonicos in new york city his famous oration the new south flagrantly distorting conditions in the former confederate states he gave the assurance that the south could be depended up to treat the negro equitably his audience of some of the most prominent and powerful northern business men magazine and newspaper editors and former union generals frequently applauded him and gave him a standing ovation at the end of his mellifluous address a band played way down south in dixie although the northern press did not accord the orator the almost unstinted praise which subsequent mythology has bestowed upon grady many northern editors naively greeted enthusiastically this milestone on the road to reunion as an invitation to expand their investments in what was still in large measure the old south booker t washington embellished the myth of the new south in his equally famous and more effective address at atlanta georgia on september washington had less excuse than did grady for this continuation of the myth in fact washington had previously excoriated the myth in an address to the womens new england club of boston january washington condemned the sharecropping system more vehemently than frederick douglass had done years earlier in an address to the american social science association washington pointed out that schools for negroes were kept open only three and a half months in the rural areas of alabama he flatly contradicted grady and stated that railway accommodations in the south for negroes were inferior to those for whites washington went further and accused grady of not telling the truth about the new south here are washingtons exact words it would have been the simple truth if mr grady had said that in the whole of georgia and alabama and other southern states not a negro juror is allowed to sit in the jury box and while on that subject mr grady might have added even at the risk of spoiling his rhetoric the information that since freedom there have been at least colored men in the south murdered by white men and yet with perhaps a single exception the record of no court shows that a single white man has been hanged for these murders if time would admit an analysis of mr gradys speech i would reveal other equally untrue statements washington did take time later in this speech to state that southern white men privately admitted that they kept the negro vote from being counted whenever that vote might have a controlling influence in an election the next year confirmed washingtons reference in this speech to the disenfranchisement of negroes mississippi adopted the first constitutional amendment in the postreconstruction period for the express purpose of preventing large numbers of negroes from voting and of allowing equally unqualified whites to vote what then is the explanation for washingtons apostasy at atlanta on september when he concluded his address with a prayer to god that a determination to administer absolute justice coupled with material prosperity will bring into our beloved south a new heaven and a new earth was he as cynical as henry iv of france had been when he justified his apostasy with the famous remark paris vaut bien une messe henry iv became a catholic in order to gain control of france washington became an admirer of the new south in order to gain control of negro leadership how fortunate it was for frederick douglass that the great abolitionist and advocate of equal rights for negroes had died seven months before washingtons vain attempt to salvage as much of the promise of emancipation as he could but there were negroes in the audience at atlanta who understood as douglass probably would have understood the blow that washington had delivered to the promise james creelman a well known reporter of the new york world observed that at the end of the speech most of the negroes in the audience were crying perhaps without knowing just why washington was later moved perhaps to tears also at the same time that he was delivering his compromise address south carolina was preparing its constitutional amendment to disenfranchise and disfranchise negroes in the united states supreme court for the first time sanctioned the principle of separate but equal accommodations mckinley in his inaugural address made a donothing promise which should have warned washington that he could not rely upon the new south the white house the supreme court or congress for the protection of negroes civil_rights mckinley promised it will be my constant aim to do nothing and permit nothing to be done that will arrest or disturb this growing sentiment of unity and cooperation this revival of esteem and affiliation which now animates so many thousands in both the old antagonistic sections but i shall cheerfully do everything possible to promote and increase it the decline of the populist movement the gradual disappearance of negroes from southern state legislatures the valedictory in of george h white the last negro of the postreconstruction era in the house of representatives the continued disfranchisement by southern states of negroes the lynching of almost negroes a year the inequitable allotment of public school funds led booker t washington as early as to express publicly his disillusionment at the same time leading northern magazines and newspapers continued to lampoon negroes congress refused to enforce the second section of the fourteenth amendment which required a reduction in the number of representatives to which a state was entitled if it denied the right to vote for any reason except for participation in rebellion or other crimes the federal government refused to enact new laws or to enforce the remnants of the reconstruction laws to protect the civil_rights of negroes for these reasons i have called the beginning of the twentieth century the nadir the lowest point in the fulfillment of the promise of emancipation but in august william edward burghardt du bois born in the year when the fourteenth amendment was added to the constitution refused to accept the virtual nullification of the promise of emancipation at the second meeting of the niagara movement this one at harpers ferry he stoutly asserted we shall not be satisfied to take one jot or tittle less than our full manhood rights we claim for ourselves every single right that belong to a freeborn american political civil and social and until we get these rights we will never cease to protest and assail the ears of america du bois thus gave a new meaning to the declaration of independence the emancipation proclamation the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments in a white mob ran amok in springfield illinois the only city in which lincoln had owned a home william english walling sounded a new call to arms in his article race war in the north in the independent september either the spirit of the abolitionists of lincoln and lovejoy must be revived and we must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and social equality or vardaman and tillman will soon have transferred the race war to the north the stouthearted declaration of du bois at harpers ferry in the scene of john browns raid in had not aroused the conscience of many americans white or negro but the mob in springfield illinois had in a paraphrase of the memorable words of talleyrand about one of bonapartes mistakes committed worse than a crime it had committed a blunder the mob startled the ideological heirs of the abolitionists oswald garrison villard a grandson of william lloyd garrison drafted the call for a meeting on the centennial of lincolns birthday the signers of the call eminent men and women negro and white protestants jews catholics and freethinkers signed the call in the course of organizing a more perfect union of the neoabolitionists the leaders held an open meeting at cooper union may in new york city where abraham lincoln had delivered one of the most effective addresses of his career an address which in the opinion of many historians won the support of the east for the homely uncouth railsplitters candidacy for the presidency of the united states in may there was organized the permanent body to be known as the national association for the advancement of colored people the first president was moorfield storey who had learned his abolitionist principles from charles sumner oswald garrison villard was the disbursing treasurer du bois the only negro official at that time was director of publicity and research what a colossal blunder the springfield mob had committed du bois moved from atlanta to new york and in the pages of the crisis castigated the conscience of america he also started a new generation of heirs to garrison douglass and lincoln whatever one may think of du bois today his earlier role of winning disciples to his harpers ferry declaration places him in the forefront of the neoabolitionists who have participated in the new quest for the fulfillment of the promise of emancipation after the formation of the naacp in and soon thereafter of the national urban league the low rugged plateau began to merge into hills and then into peaks from which one could view the promised land the role of the naacp of the nul of the association for the study of negro life and history of negro newspapers churches schools writers artists athletes participants in sitins freedom rides and of white organizations and individuals constitutes a glorious chapter in the history of the united states this chapter can not be written here but its chronology destroys a myth which i have recently heard in the united states europe latin america and even in africa according to this myth negroes began definitely to move toward the promised land since and as a result of the cold war with the soviet union now the cold war began in years after the formal organization of the naacp and of the national urban league years after the supreme court declared peonage unconstitutional years after the court declared the grandfather clause unconstitutional years after the court ruled that state laws permitting residential segregation were unconstitutional it would be an act of supererogation to list other decisions in which the court prior to almost unremittingly ruled in favor of the civil_rights of negroes six years before the beginning of the cold war president franklin d roosevelt signed executive order which popularized the concept of nondiscrimination on account of race color religion or national origin in the state of new york enacted the first state law containing this new promise of emancipation it is on the other hand true that the cold war accelerated action by government organizations and private individuals as early as may acting secretary of state dean acheson had written to the fair employment practice committee i think it is quite obvious that the existence of discriminations against minority groups in the united states is a handicap in our relations with other countries the department of state therefore has good reason to hope for the continued and increased effectiveness of public and private efforts to do away with these discriminations and president trumans committee on civil_rights added in its report to secure these rights the united states is not so strong the final triumph of the democratic ideals is not so inevitable that we can ignore what the world thinks of our record but i submit that the momentum gained before accelerated action without going so far as do mechanistic philosophers of history i believe to a certain degree in the rhythm of social change a rhythm which was increasing in tempo prior to and on the whole still continues
negro youth by dr ralph j bunche have no mandate to i f speak on behalf of any one but myself but i know what i who have been for years an american of negro ancestry want and how i feel i do not doubt that my wants and feelings are fairly representative of those of most of my race i want to be a man on the same basis and level as any white citizeni want to be as free as the whitest citizen i want to exercise and in full the same rights as the white american i want to be eligible for employment exclusively on the basis of my skills and employability and for housing solely on my capacity to pay i want to have the same privileges the same treatment in public places as every other person but this should not be read by anyone to mean that i want to be white or that i am pushy seeking to go where i am not wanted far from it i am as proud of my origin ancestors and race as anyone could be indeed i resent nothing more than a racial slur or stigma i want to go and to do only where and what all americans are entitled to go and to do this i think is what every american negro feels it may be expressed in polite eloquence by some in bitterness or even outright belligerence by others it may cause some just to break out and start to knock things around but in each case the emotion is sound and urgent and american i believe i could readily understand and accept this if i were not a negro if i were white i can never really understand why the white man whether from south or north seems to find it difficult to do so i am not sure that he does it is possible that deep down in his heart he knows that the negro cause is right and just that i think may explain why there is so much less of racial tension in southern and northern communities today than there was a quarter century ago despite the fact that the negro is bolder and more demanding and that the walls of segregation have been often breached why raceriots do not occur why ku klux klansmen now just meekly hand out leaflets i cannot understand how anyone claiming to be a good american can condone the denial of these elementals of democracy to any other american how can anyone be so manifestly against the very essence of americanismnot to mention fairness and decencyand at the same time purport to be fighting communism while thus giving to the communists the strongest weapon they have against us negro citizens may be pardoned for expecting their white fellow citizens to be at least consistent the logic and the evidence are all against the racebaiting bitterenders it is so obvious that no one can miss it that the south at it has reluctantly lowered some of its racial bars is better offpolitically economically and culturally than it has ever been the greatest resource of any community state or nation is its people and it is recklessly shortsighted to waste that resource as the south and to only lesser extent the north has been doing for so long depriving the negro worker of fair employment costs the nation dearly in lost manhours production consumption and taxes i suppose i speak with an unavoidable bias but i feel that if i were a white citizen in the south today i would look at my black or brown brother and say to myself what responsibility do i share for the crime that has been perpetrated not alone against this individual but against the community and the nation what have i contributed to the degradation of this fellow american who except for a sheer accident of birth could be me or my brother what can i do to rectify an injustice to the individual and a loss to the nation this being youth night i really should close on a word especially for youth although i do not care very much for distinctions among people even on the basis of age white or black old or young the real test comes in what you have done or can do in a competitive world you must rise to meet the competition that means preparation it also means building up confidence on the basis of demonstrated performance in connection with preparation the school dropout figures for negro youth are alarming it is an exciting and inspiring world to be in and although there are great dangers in it much tension and cause for worry it affords vast opportunitygreater i think for youth black as well as white than has ever been known ours is a great country great not only in its physical resources and technological capacity but also in its ideals and its political structure and in its ability to admit its faults openly and try to do something about them that is the case with our problemthe negro problem it is after all a credit to the virility and fidelity of our system that a minority group such as ours can carry on a successful struggle for its rights there are unhappily not very many countries in the world today where this can be done i think that democracy is the very best way of life we have an obligation as citizens to make it work here as it is supposed to work in doing that we are helping the nation as well as ourselves it seems to me that in our concern with the threat of communism we do not do justice to our own system we permit communism to become an obsession with us and force us into a defensive and negative posture my concern is with democracy not communism i believe that the best counter to the threat of any ism is never to be obsessed by it and to concentrate on making our own far superior system of democracy work up to the maximum of its potentiality we can never afford to be complacent but i see the outlook as good for us the outcome is certainthe negro citizen will one day walk in this society without stigma the naacp firmly dedicated to our advancement and always in the forefront of our struggle affords unfailing leadership in that struggle it merits the unqualified gratitude of every negro indeed of everyone who loves democracy and decency the negro who does not support the naacp is selling his own future short the naacp will i am sure be flexible enough in its program and approaches to deal with all situations it will develop new tactics to meet new needs i have some concern about a growing tendency toward a proliferation of organizations working in the civil_rights field we can only weaken our effort by an excessive diffusion of our limited resources of leadership and finance i may say also that i have always been disappointed about the membership roll of the naacp since most negroes ardently wish that we strive for most negroes ought to be members of the organization the naacp should have a mass base it should boast millions of members and much more ought to be done toward that end increasingly u s public opinion rallies to our cause the principles and objectives of the un support us most of the world is behind us we can and will eliminate this moral shame from the nation finally i would say to every young negro dont ever lower your sights dont let the fiction of race impair your vision or narrow your horizon of hope never think in terms of limitationsthere need be none at least none that you cannot overcome resolve to do what you aspire to do and eliminate the racial factor in your calculation train for what you want to do break into it face it with confidence and above all defend your dignity as men and women with all you have a strange kind of love by lillian smith speaks in the rebel of a kind of love sists on changing mens lives a love complex critical and often reacted to with hatea love which sometimes turns itself into hate when the rebel does not understand his rebellion you cannot come close to the present nonviolent movement in the south without feeling this strange love it warmsand it burns it reveals mens depthsand heights it appeals to their compassion down with jin cm and it stirs their hate it is conciliatingand it is adamant it is a powerful thing men do not always behave creatively in its presence gandhi knew wellno one knew betterthe potency and the i dangers of the nonviolent way of bringing about change the ritual istic acting out of the need for change and no one has used this way more successfully one reason for his successthere were others lay in his stern refusal to let his followers forget the seductive ease with which their own natures could misuse this ritualistic weapon he warned them that regardless of selfdiscipline or the righteousness of their cause or the desire not to harbor resentment in the act of protest itself lies dormant violence it does not followhis life made this plainthat protest should not occur nor that men have devised a better or more effective way to bring about change than by the use of the nonviolent protest among enlightened southerners there is today more argument about this than about segregation itself few approve openly of martin_luther_king the moderates who are amenable to slow change angrily protest the negroes use of this method even those who have been active for full desegregation of public facilities and hundreds of thousands of whites are seem to feel a curious resentment toward these nonviolent ritualsor is it an undefined fear however we name it many of our best people are attacking the nonviolent methods and philosophy which the students and dr_kings group are using it is of these that i write for they are now the makers of public opinion the day of the rabid segregationists the obscene demagogues is overas recent elections in georgia have shown mississippi is just beginning its ordeal and at present there is little likelihood that leadership will arise there bold enough to free the people quickly from their servitude to the past the problem is the old one of states rights vs human rights it is clarified as a matter of constitutional law for governor barnett is defying the federal courts he has failed in his attempt to interpose this state between young meredith and the highest court of the land every thoughtful american knows his attempt had to fail it is as simple as that as citizens of the usa we owe the highest court our obedience mississippians are not exempt whatever we may think of the law it must be obeyed as it is interpreted by the supreme court the president was of course compelled to see that obedience was given what price mississippians will pay for their defiance we do not know it is possible that the oxford ordeal will have the final effect of clearing their minds of the myths and fantasies which the demagogues have for so long substituted for the truth there is in much of the south however a more benevolent flexible mood then why this angry resentment of martin_luther_king and the sitin students it is not segregation we are defending an albany citizen wrote me we were going to accept desegregation of schools quietly at least a token desegregationuntil these negroes started demanding things now look at the anger in our town is it right to break laws as a protest should young negroes be encouraged to go to jail shouldnt they be taught instead to be respectable whether or not albany would accept without resentment any kind of desegregation is highly problematical but it is true that its citizens voted against the demagogue griffin and for the more moderate sanders for governor the letter just quoted from was written by a highly intelligent woman who has often spoken out against segregation now she is confusedand she says her liberal friends are you can remind them there may be a specious tinge in their insistence that negroes obey local statutes when our officials many of our congressmen and many business men have urged the whites not to obey the directives of the supreme court you can remind them that in countries distant from us we call young men who fight for their freedom heroes not jail birds even though they are thrown into prison but we miss the point by indulging in such epicyclic arguments the reason for this moral and mental confusion lies not in the rational part of minds but closer to the mythical much of it is down where stereotypes are made for nearly a century we southerners have stereotyped not only the negro but ourselves we now find it difficult to see ourselves or negroes as complex human beings each with varying gifts and differences and all with the same civil_rights instead we see ourselves as nice people who if not pushed too hard will give negroes a bag of goodies now and then we see ourselves graciously handing them little bits of their rights which are not ours to hand doling them out as we or our grandfathers used to dole out fat bacon and sweets and cornmeal at christmas we see ourselves shimmering in an aura of kindness we feel goodhearted and often gently tender as we give our little presents but they are not ours to giveah this is what hurts the negroes are reminding us their rights are not ours to give as we see fit but theirsgiven them as human rights by god and as civil_rights by the u s constitution what hurts is watching this nice image of ourselves crumble to dust for as the negroes sit in or picket or quietly stand in front of city hall asking for a conference with the mayor or the city council they are not begging nor bowing and scraping they are with dignity and selfdiscipline asking for what is theirs and asking for it now and suddenly the stereotypes we have made of them and of us collide and clash and break into splinters we feel nakedly exposed as we stare at our real selves and stunned as we stare at them these are not nice negroes who are satisfied with things as they are but human beings wanting for themselves and their children the right to grow to learn to question to become to feel secure in their home towns and as we glimpse ourselves we see something queasily dishonest which we cannot bear to acknowledge how can we be so proud of our kindnesses to the few negroes we know when we have stubbornly kept from all negroes their civil_rightsrights that are as much theirs as our civil_rights are ours let me say at once the personal kindnesses shown by white individuals to negroes the compassion revealed in thousands of small deeds the sacrificial acts the risking of their lives now and then by whites who have loathed the white supremacy systemand there have been always from civil war days thousands who didare the most precious part of our southern cultur in spite of demagogues in spite of restrictions which have bitten as deep into our lives as into negroes lives many white southerners have been gentle kind and have maintained relationships of genuine quality with negro individuals i say quickly too that i want no world where only civil_rights are observedhowever fairly they are observed we need both our rights and the mercy of others we cannot live as human beings in a world without grace right here is the fatal flaw in communism which theoretically says mercy grace and generosity in human relations are not needed but neither can men live as men without their civil_rights there is no eitheror there must be both and dramatically though quietly the gestures words and ritualistic acts of the nonviolent protesters have brought this home to us brought it with the same kindness and grace a few white individuals through the troubled decades have shown to them i am willing to say that had there not been those good and valid personal relationships through the last century a nonviolent movement could not have drawn negroes to its philosophy they would have found it too hard to forgive but there is another cause for the resentment of methods used by the nonviolent group many suffer a severe psychic difficulty in dealing with this strange love compassion from someone you consider beneath you or whom you have harmed enrages youif you are easily enrageda forgiving spirit in a negro can as one man said to me make you want to tear him to pieces what is he forgiving me for what have done things boil inside guilt chokes kindness arrogance claws at fairness the truth is that we can meet nonviolence creatively only if we respect nonviolence we can relate to compassion only if somewhere in us there exists a little compassion we can give justice only if we value justice we can respond to humor in some of these situations only if we value humor the nonviolent philosophy is a catalyst powerful and difficult in its spiritual demands and there is something else it is human not to want to be put in a position where we act or despise ourselves for not acting the negroes nonviolent protests bring to a town its moment of truth we can no longer slide along complacently we are compelled to make decisions right or wrong suppose for instance you walk into a drug store where negro students are sittingin at the lunch counter there they are quietly sitting on the stools usually reading school books sometimes the bible you watch suddenly white hoodlums edge in one slaps a student another sticks a burning cigarette in a black the students do not move every muscle in you aches to help these students and yet you do nothing you would tackle the hoodlums maybe but you tell yourself you might start a riot and you might and suddenly you are sick with guilt how can you stand there then as suddenly anger overcomes your guilt and you yell silently to the students fight back but the nonviolent protesters just sit there taking the blows taking the burning cigarette now something else happens inside you a nasty indecent something whispers ok cowards let the hoodlums use the chain on you see if i care you walk out you have not done or said a thing but you are sick all over for you do care what happens you cant help but care and suddenly you are raging mad with yourself and with the hoodlums and with the students and you settle the stinging turmoil inside you by saying it is these negroes who are disturbing the peace of our town things were fineuntil they came or maybe you are a prominent businessman sitting in your office trying to make a profitable deal for your firmand beyond you is this spiritual turmoil this challenge you know it concerns you and your children but there is this deal to pull offso you turn your moment of truth over to the chief of police and tell him to handle those negroes who are disturbing the peace whose peace yours the hoodlums they have certainly disturbed something in your townbut not its peace only its apathy itsr complacency its paralysis in the face of a changing whirling world that wont wait no matter how loudly we americans south or north beg it to wait and they have mixed up your values they have disturbed your peace of soul and mindfor we have not measured up to the moral challenge offered us the biggest that will be offered us in our lifetime and now and now we are touching a sensitive thing hard to grasp firmly and bring up for eyes to look at segregation itself what has this way of life done to us all have we whites by its terrible logic changed from human beings into hollow men where is our virtue our excellence did we trade it for white superiority have we in this cultural nightmare turned into the stereotype we made of the negros soul is it we who are satisfied with things as they are is it we who are apathetic and without courage to speak up for the rights of our own and other children to grow and become where is the hollowness we thought we had made when in stereotyping the negro we scooped out his love of freedom his spiritual dignity his hope is it now inside our own souls did we think we could dehumanize the negro without dehumanizing ourselves and now we are touching something else the dynamic quality of change itself how can we change the southern way of life without changing ourselves without learning to think with honest logic the nonviolent movement is telling us by its philosophy and its ritualistic acts that change comes not only by a few external acts but by a great many internal acts it is forcing us although its leaders may be only dimly aware of itinto embarking on an orphic journey it is compelling us to seek the hidden poetic truth in this tumultuous agony to reach deep into our hell and grasp eurydice by our questions and lure her close enough to our hearts to feel her once more this movement not by its nonviolent methods but by the reiteration of those powerful words love compassion redemption grace is compelling us to search for truth that of our region and of ourselves their radiating power reminds us that we must find a new way of relating ourselves not only to each other but to reality itself to the times we live in to ultimate concerns and some of us had thought we could skin out of the dark bitter past without even admitting we had done wrong we had thought a little token desegregation would rub out a century of our calendar of sins how simple minded and how blank we have been the black muslimsgrowing steadily in power and influence are telling negros to beware the nonviolent movement those negroes and that martin_luther_king are actually forgiving white folks for centuries of sins they are appeasers ready to settle for integration well we are not we want black supremacy and are going to get it someday well make the whites pay for their sins but the whites are not listening to the black muslims they are resenting wasting precious time resenting the firm quiet offers made by dr_king and the students and other leaders to reason together and work things out the nonviolent protesters are demanding their rights yes but at the same time they are offering us not black supremacy not a black kkk not black mobs but gifts of good will conciliation forgiveness they dont want to take our rights away as do the black muslims they only want theirs but the big story which many are missing is that now has come their time to heal broken relationships to give presents of mutual forgiveness and a mutual bearing of spiritual burdens this arouses in some not warmth not gratitude not awe but anxiety they find this strange love offered us this passion for our common welfare and common future extremely disturbing one man said this let the black muslims come i prefer them to these damned nonviolent niggers i know what to do with a black muslim but what does one do when offered forgiveness and love this means weve gotta straighten things out as one white put it and how hard this now seems to people who had convinced themselves that a little token desegregation would do it then business could go on as usual art could go on as usual philosophy religion could go on as usual politics and nownow we know better a man must accept limits to his rebellion as camus so wisely said whether it is rebellion against the past or the future if the word moderation has any meaning left in it after its misuse for the past decade it lies in this necessity to accept limits the nonviolent group has done so its members exclude physical violence and verbal arrogance they exclude resentment they try never to refuse a chance for conciliating talks but they put no limit on each individuals capacity for forgiveness no limit on compassion no limit on willingness to help bear the white mans psychic burdens this is in effect a tremendous spiritual challenge to white southernersone many of us are unable to rise to at present these acts these wordshow are we to answer where have we put the limits to our rebellion against change are limits set only against mobs terrorists arsonists demagogues only against the closing of our schools have we set limits to our arrogance our hubris our complacency our refusal to see what the future demands of us can we meet compassion with compassion justice with justice reconciliation with reconciliation there can be no limits to love it must be and is durable and longlasting there can be no limits to honor and justice and mercy only a profound humility can say we have done wrong and are even now doing wrong it requires character to be humble character to accept this strange love offered by negroes to help us bear the burdens of our common future and our common fears this strange love is the essence of the christian religion its roots go deep into the jewish religion it is what valid religion is about that superb writer charles williams now dead but well remembered in england a friend of t s eliot and c s lewis speaks in his essays and novels more clearly than any contemporary writer of the love that says let me bear your fear for you you can then do what you need to do let me ease you of your anxiety i cannot do your work this you must do but i can bear your fear and though the leaders of the nonviolent movement have not used these words they in their ritualistic acts and their conciliating talk are saying to the white south you have no need to fear revenge or malice from us all we ask is that you let us help bear the fears you have for the future all we want is to help meet that future with courageand with grace but many whites turn away saying they make mistakes too they are not always forgiving some of their leaders do foolish things of course they do some of their leaders have not as yet made their own orphic journey others commit tactical errors a few are not spiritually concerned enough for this ordeal some of the college kids are thinking more about their rights than they are of what they will do with these rights some of the young northern whites in the movement feel more anger toward white southerners than compassion though all are courageous this is true and because they have undertaken a rigorous vocation they must demand all that is possible of themselves or get out of the movement but all groups all movements even saints come short of perfection what this group is saying to the south and the nation is worth listening to worth reaching out for let us stifle our angry shouts and try to hear the small voice that is speaking to us it is possible this philosophy these conciliating nonviolent acts may save us even though some say we dont deserve saving from the eye for an eye the tooth for a tooth rage of those black supremacists who have succumbed to a ravening hunger for revenge if we listen in time the beanpickers by robert knight ater on this year or maybe even now your local newspaper will run an ad similar to this one wanted to men to harvest vegetables apples or what have you apply your local employment office i like many unemployed boys decided to look into this i went to my local employment office to get more information on the subject i was told that this place was in upstate new york you would get fiftycents for every bushel of stringbeans picked and that the transportation would be free a bus would be leaving the employment office at oclock that friday morning that nice sleeping quarters would be at your disposal providing you brought your own blankets and sheets oh it sounded good i figured that i could pick at least bushels a day but i was in for a surprise as i was later to find out i rushed home and told mom and dad about it dad admitted that it sounded good and since the employment office seemed to have all the statistics about it he assumed that it was ok but mom was against it for she had heard that such trips only ended in hardships dad and i finally persuaded her to let me go some friends of mine were also going i packed my luggage and could hardly wait until friday came friday finally came and we went to the employment office the bus was already there a shagglylooking bus with florida plates the driver and his two companions were sloppily dressed and had the smell of alcohol about them the man that had interviewed us earlier called our names from a long list as we boarded the bus as we rode off i noticed that the bus was filthy dirt at least two inches thick was on the floor with an assortment of wine and sodapop bottles here we were about thirtyfive of us all going to what we thought would be a little easy money we rode all morning and half the afternoon before we finally stopped at a service station and ate we had brought lunches i was glad to get off that stuffy bus and stretch my legs we stayed at the service station for about an hour and we were off again we had gone no more than three miles when i heard this rumbling noise from what seemed to be the motor the bus stopped and the driver got out and looked at the motor and other parts he discovered that the drive shaft had broken all of us got off the bus and sat down on the side of the road the driver hitched a ride to the nearest town to try and get the part repaired it was just about dark when he returned with the disappointing news that the part was beyond repair we slept on the bus that night and i thought id faint for the bus was overloaded and had an awful smell about it morning came and we ate the last of the little food we had brought with us the driver went to a house across the road to make a telephone call i later learned that he had called the farm in upstate new york and told them to send another bus it would take the other bus at least another day to reach us we were about miles from home stranded and without money for food we slept on the bus again that night some of the fellows took their blankets and slept outside but i couldnt put up with those mosquitoes and crawling insects the next morning the driver gave two of the fellows fivedollars to hike to the nearest store four miles away to get baloney and bread for the of us i noticed that the driver and his companions personalities were changing with each mile from bad to worse when the fellows returned from the store they issued each of us a baloney sandwich it was a measly meal but we were thankful early the next morning the other bus arrived it was in worse condition than the first with the exception that it had a good motor we boarded somewhat relieved somewhat depressed we arrived at our destination late that night the sleeping quarters werent ready we were told so we slept on the bus again that night the next morning we looked the place over and i was disgusted at what i saw the rooms looked as if they would cave in if you coughed loud enough grass was growing through the floor and there was hardly any roof over your head you could sit on your bed if you were lucky enough to get one and see spiders and grasshoppers coming through the cracks there were about people at this place some from alabama north and south carolina but the largest portion of them were from florida this place is located about five miles from the little town of earlville n y the camp is situated on a high hill with chicken coopmike shacks scattered here and there if you were lucky enough to get any food they had what was called a cookhouse and you would have to stand in line to use it about noon we asked the man that we had been told was in charge of the place when we were going to get something to eat he told us to see his wife and that she would fix us up we went to his wifes shack to inquire about the food she told us that we would have to put our luggage in pawn to her for the food and when we made some money we could get the luggage back i was too hungry to argue with her so we gave her the luggage the next morning we boarded a bus and rode for nearly an hour before we came upon an enor mously large field where there were at least people picking stringbeans how a person was to make any money with so much competition was beyond me and picking them wasnt as easy as it seemed that day i picked two bushels they call them hampers which was worth a dollar to me i decided that this wasnt for me so a close friend of mine henry and i began saving our dollars and sharing our food how we were going to get our luggage out of pawn was a mystery sometimes while we worked the fellows that didnt work stole our food there was an apple tree not far from the camp with green fruit on it henry and i ate as many of them as we possibly could we finally wrote our parents now that we saw that we couldnt save enough money to come home and told them the condition of things and to send us bus fare but i learned that even your mail wasnt safe so henry and i hiked the five miles to earlville and there we called our parents they accepted the charges and we told them to send the money we had written for care of general delivery to the earlville post office three days later henry and i hiked the five miles back to earlville i was overjoyed when the clerk handed me the letter from mom and dad as if by some miracle there was a letter for henry too we forgot all about our luggage and caught the next bus home when most of the other fellows came home they all had sad tales to tell they said that the foreman began putting up roadblocks to keep the people on the camp for so many were leaving some of the fellows havent come back yet maybe they found jobs up there or something im glad that we got away from that place and ill never go on another of those trips so take it from one who knows the ad in the paper may sound so good but its oh so bad shell never know i came by freda goldstein the agency sent her that fall after i had spinal surgery and was recuperating i had never had household help in my home and didnt quite know how to handle the relationship howdedo maam she was standing at the door of our old house im sarah bowman the agency sent me to help out i opened the door wide and invited her in it will be good to have help she stood in the oldfashioned entranceway almost timidly but i managed to shut the door in back of her i was making progress and was pleased by my sudden mobility she was unobtrusive those first days and said little beyond acquiescent yes maams or no maams it disturbed me to be addressed so formally i wasnt used to servants and in addition didnt care to get used to servitude in the end it was the common ground of being mothers of adolescent girls that changed our relationship mrs bowman had five children but it was rose who dominated her thoughts and conversation rose got a hundred on her examination yesterday she said at first casually shes pretty good at music too she added glancing at my daughters cello resting in the corner course we couldnt afford those piana lessons and didnt have no piana anyway the folks at the settlement said rose could be a concert star it was the same with our library rose likes to read she volunteered glancing at our collection she sure is a great reader or commenting on our girls modest attempts at oil painting rose went to the art classes at the settlement she painted real beautiful pictures as the weeks progressed i shared with mrs bowman the joys and setbacks of her daughters school career the teacher sent for me to come parents night she told me one day by this time she had become comfortable enough to drop the title maam or at least suspected it didnt sit well with me something will have to be done about rose she informed me after the parents meeting shes too durned smart for that school at sixteen years of age the girl was completing high school and the problem now was where to place her as i grew stronger mrs bowmans days with me decreased until by spring she was on a twiceaweek basis i could hardly wait to hear of the progress of roses college applications details of the various campaigns were discussed over coffeeand before mrs bowman got the work under way for the day without being too presumptuous i had given my opinion and suggestions you should aim for an integrated school mrs bowman i finally told her rose will probably have a career in science and should have all the advantages a nonsegregated school has to offer how about my husbands college in view of her ambitions for the girl it was strange she resisted this idea i realized she was fearful rose might get hurt and though i knew her fears were wellgrounded i believed one could not get a liberal education in a narrow environment rose would have to take her chances she would gain in the end i was sure we were down to the last hard details roses teacher said there was some kind of place in the city that could help her get into state college she added unnecessarily we cant pay you know i thought a moment perhaps the teacher means the armstrong association they specialize in placing negro students in graduate school and even on positions maybe they could help roses college career had become an intense and personal thing with me i started for the telephone let me call them i recall how she arose abruptly although not finished with her coffee and said strangely reverting to her old custom no no maam rose will do it herself it was a great day when mrs bowman made the final announcement rose got a full scholarship for the paying university she named a school some miles distant shell be going after the summer this called for more than coffee we had a real celebration rose is graduating first in the class she informed me in early june i wished i could have attended the commencement but no invitation was forthcoming i sent the best gift i could manage mrs bowman was now coming only once a week and always there was a piece of information about roses academic achievements although i was quite pleased with our daughters interests and their progress both in and out of school i fear i prodded them to greater ambition holding up as an example roses attributes the girls determination to do worthwhile things with herself despite the obstacles of her natural environment and the discriminatory barriers she had to hurdle had impressed me tremendously the following fall rose entered the university and immediately began to make giant strides mrs bowman was very pleased i sure never dream when i was little and saw girls from white folks houses go off to college that some day my girl would gojust like them i was almost entirely well by then and since my husbands modest income from teaching had to be stretched to cover the multitude of things one should do when in the academic milieu i had to cut out mrs bowmans weekly visits altogether occasionally she phoned me to see how i was and to bring me to date on roses accomplishments the bowmans didnt have a telephone and i had no way to reach them gradually the calls diminished and then ceased rose became a legend to our girls it was almost summertime when the final call came maam an unfamiliar male voice was on the other end this heres sam sam bowman i had never talked with mrs bowmans husband before and had a sudden premonition of disaster my woman died yestiddy i thought youd wanta know she he faltered she sure was fond of you shocked by the announcement i nevertheless managed to pull myself together sufficiently to mumble some formalities the details of the funeral services now mine i murmured a few kind words and hung up my emotions were mixed between the loss of a good person and roses loss no one else in the family had encouraged or helped her according to mrs bowman they had all referred to her ambitions for her talented daughter as dicty i had had a great affection for sarah bowman and an even greater respect i brushed the warm tears from my face i had never been in that neighborhood before and knew only vaguely where the church was mrs bowman had never said much about her church affiliation it hadnt seemed to play an important role in her life as with me her educational and cultural goals had far exceeded her spiritual drive i left home early the following morning as i was afraid of getting lost but found the church without delay it was empty when i entered it and saw the closed casket down in front of the pulpit i was again alone with sarah bowman i slipped into a seat in the rear and sat in silence watching the sun play on the casket through the stainedglass window it was a small church and it filled quickly it was not until the minister began his service that i realized i was the only white person there i scanned the faces of the teenagers as they entered the first row and wondered which was roses noi rejected a few possibilities she wouldnt dress like that mrs bowman had often told me with pride how the neighboring youngsters had ridiculed roses conservative attire rose couldnt care less what they said she wasnt about to look like a sportin woman as the processional passed i judged the first group of mourners to be the bowman family youngsters of the correct ages clung to a middleaged man but the sixteen or seventeen year old girl alongside of them couldnt have been rose she was disheveled and walked with a sullen swagger brilliant toe nails peeped out of her open sandals as i was physically unable to drive the distance to the cemetery i approached a woman in the group which followed and asked her to forward my condolences to mr bowman at her first opportunity you must be the lady sarah was always talkin about is your mister the pfesser at the college she asked seeming to know of me im sams sister maam she offered its that nocount gal who killed her she continued to volunteer information although i was too embarrassed to comment on this violent assumption all her ma done for her and still she was bad couldnt study jes no good always gittin in trouble too the sisterinlaw paused and sighed nocount thats what they were all cept sarah in an attempt to get her mind off the subject of the bad daughter i said i had no idea mrs bowman was having trouble with any of the girls but she rarely spoke of the othersonly of rose she looked at me quizzically i went on i remember how proud she was when rose got the scholarship to the university i continued i looked for her today but i suppose she hasnt gotten here yet due to the distance of her college the woman stared at me in astonishment what college who you talkin bout rose never went to no college sarah couldnt even git the teacher to keep her in school they dont want no year old gals clutterin up the th grade no more i gazed at her incredulously she added sarah bowman couldnt ever git it in her haid that that gal wuz no good course even if she wuz her color wouldnt help her none she shrugged her shoulders hopelessly guess she figgered twont no use try in anyhow she turned to follow the disappearing mourners and looked back at me sarah sure admired lamin and all the things your chillun done shed sure be glad to know you come to her funeral i returned to my seat alone in the church and gazed at the spot where the casket had stood im glad i thought that shell never know i came the peacocks ugly feet by irene c edmonds earliest recollection of the south concerns itself with a peacock i must have been barely three years old i seem to remember riding through a beautiful place in a buggy with my mother and father i am quite sure that someones especial largesse was responsible for the buggy negro presbyterian ministers had little of the worlds goods at that time the swishing of the horses tail and his sleek brown hind quarters occupied most of my attention until suddenly i looked up and there it wasbehind a high black iron fence its fan was all spread out and the shiny lovely colors sent delicious shivers through my body i was quite sure that the rainbow had fallen from the sky my mother told me that this was a bird called a peacock i begged to stop so that i might reach through the black bars to touch the bright feathers but my mother said that we couldnt stop there to forestall my inevitable why she said something elsewouldnt it be wonderful if the peacocks feet were as beautiful as the rest of his body this time my mother answered my why she said his feet are rather ugly to go with the beauty of the rest of him by then i couldnt see the peacock any more but this is what i remember about the place where i was bom the lovely peacock the high black iron fence my mothers wistful words and the ugly feet that did not go with beauty i did not know until a number of years later that the peacock i could not stop to see was in a public park negroes were not allowed there and so for me the peacock has always symbolized the south as i have known it a land of almost circean beauty that has such tragically ugly feet tomorrow i must find a new image the high iron fences have begun to crack and they will someday tumble the ugly feet have started their tortured metamorphosis slowly but positively as token integration moves toward complete desegregation as overt compliance of the law moves toward personal compliance then shall come the great moral crisis in our american society no one will be able to turn his back on it the metamorphosis will be taking place everywhere and it will affect equally the negro and the white the indifferent and the obstinate the northern liberal and the southern extremist many will find for the first time that the negro problem is not comfortably remote it will assault them directly testing their noble sentiments their moral fibre their christian consciences for many whites i realize the next two decades embody changes not easily imagined or readily accepted the negro will be your neighbor his children will be your childrens schoolmates you will encounter him in new roles as a judge in a court of law as a doctor in a hospital as an elected public official as a college teacher the negro will be a part of the larger society that has thus far shut him out his position in that society will be respectable and commanding of respect in hundreds of different situationsin business in social life in daytoday affairsthe negro will be there not as a meek and different new arrival but as fullfledged equal for me tomorrow holds a promise the time will come when the negro will be fully accepted as a human judged as a man and not as a glass cage representative of his race when that day arrives both white and black shall be free each to be straightforward and at ease with the other the white man must turn and face what he has long been avoiding his own prejudices his doubts and fears and the voice of his conscience he cannot continue to take refuge in the outermost suburbs abandoning his home to declining property values and a new negro ghetto further partitioning of society into white and black is no solution a divided america wastes human resources and perpetuates strife it is no answer at all but an uneasy truce that cannot last but integrationtrue integration of the negro into american society will require both wisdom and courage on the part of whites and negroes alike it will require mutual respect and intelligent planning but most of all it will require honesty not everything that is faced can be changed james baldwin has written but nothing can be changed until it is faced the time has now come for us to turn our backs forever on the big twohearted river already the winds of change have begun to blow across the countryfrom south to north testing the moral fibre and courage of the people both black and white we are nearing the fateful moment of personal decision especially in the south it is right and proper that the pressures and demands by the negro for equality and first class citizenship should begin in the south for the south perpetuated the system which enslaved him and though the emancipation proclamation and the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the constitution gave the negro his freedom and civil_rights the south refused to grant him these rights and privileges the circumventions and subterfuges which the south devised to evade the law were all designed for one purpose to keep the negro from ever being admitted to full citizenship this purpose in time became a sacred principle and the south where honor was once the watchword accepted its own fraudulent fabrications as truth in doing this the south lost inevitably some of its character this theme pervades the body of faulkners works so it is right and proper that the pressures and demands for freedom by the negro should begin in the south the south has sinned most against him and there are many good men in the south who think this but it should be pointed out that the difference between the treatment of the negro in the south and that in the north is one of degree and outward show and not in kind segregation discrimination and exclusion of the negro in the north are not legalized but all are practiced against him what the south accomplished by law tradition grandfather clauses and the poll tax the north accomplished by restrictive covenants ghettos and the unspoken word if the negro is a commodity and the white mans burden in the south as faulkner labels him in the north he is a statistic and a remote impersonal problem unconnected with human experience the south thinks it knows the negro and that all of them are alike the north thinks it set him free each belief steeped in myth and illusion distorts the vision and paralyzes the will the north like the south shows little concern about providing equal job opportunities for the negro a study of aid to dependent children in cook county illinois showed that of the job orders placed with private employment in per cent barred nonwhites still the south is more culpable even when the negro is well prepared for the job the for white only tabs traditionally exclude him no wonder walter lee younger the hero in lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun cries out to his mother in such anguish sometimes its like i can see the future stretched out in front of me just plain as day the future mama hanging over there at the edge of my days just waiting for mea big looming blank space full of nothing just waiting for me pause mamasometimes when im downtown and i pass them cool quietlooking restaurants where them white boys are sitting back and talking bout things sitting there turning deals worth millions of dollars sometimes i see guys dont look much older than me so both the north and the south using an elaborately contrived rationale attempt to put to sleep the agonizing aches of christian consciencethe north by the opiate of looking the other way the south by the opiate of living a life which is built on legendary and myth each accuses the other of injustice and intolerance to the negro yet each denies the negro that which every human being must have the dignity of being human no more and no less eliza doolittle in bernard shaws pygmalion discovers a provocative and perceptive truth on her way up from the gutter to respectability via the route of phonetics the difference between a flower girl and a duchess is not in the way she behaves but in the way she is treated to make an analogy the basic difference between a negro and a white person is not in the way he behaves but in the way he is treated what the negro wants more than anything else is to be treated as a mana human being this is no new concept others have said it just as earnestly before me and others will say it with equal earnestness after me but all the racial ferment in our land today has its roots in this one great human want on its insistence by the negro on its resistance by the white man three years ago i remember looking into a pair of eyes that belonged to a young negro college student they were bright with heldback tears as he wrestled with himself over choosing to be fined or to go to jail he had been arrested for participating in a sitin at a lunch counter in a variety store to pay the fine meant graduation on schedule no jailbird stigma and no prolonged expense to his widowed mother to go to jail meant paying the price for his belief in human dignity and freedom he chose the jail before that i had seen those same two eyes overflow with tears of love and pride for country when he heard the starspangled banner backstage in auditoriums in many african schools and cities he was participating in a cultural exchange program sponsored by the state department and our mission was to demonstrate american democracy and freedom to africans through the drama and by our persontoperson contacts we always played the national anthem before our show and there were nearly always tears in our eyes when we heard it it seemed a tragic paradox to me that this young man should have to cry in america over what he went to sell to africa there are other things the negro wants in addition to human dignity he wants the freedom to enjoy all the privilegesand responsibilities of full american citizenship he wants the freedom to educate himself where he chooses to compete fairly for a job for which he is qualified to eat and live and go where he wills to exercise his right to vote when he wishes to recreate where he desires and to pray in the church of his choice conversely there are things the negro does not want he shrinks from paternalism however disguised not because he needs no help but because paternalism relegates him to the status of a child and robs him of his right to make choices he does not want pity he does not want things made easy for him because he is negro the double standard is dead for him he is through with jim crow and back entrances over and above the hysteria of last ditch stands the racebaiting leaflets and newspaper editorials the white citizens councils and the black muslims the little rocks and birminghams and new orleans the senescent uncle toms the bull conners and mrs gaillots the headinsand gradualists and the extremists of the right and left stand counterposed the ralph mcgills and archbishop rummels the atlantas and mariettas and dallases the martin_luther_kings and thurgood marshalls the freedom rides and sitins the naacp and core and the southern christian leadership conference world opinion and the men of good will in both races giving impetus to change are the impatient ambitious raceconscious young negroes and their sympathetic young white confreres giving substance is the law of the land in the next two decades the pressures will mount even higher as the horizons of negroes widen their demands will be more insistent integration and desegregation will become accomplished fact increasingly the demands of negroes will beat with imperious insistence upon the ears of the white man on the liberal in the north on the moderate in the south on white men throughout our land it will beat upon negro ears too in an editorial in the atlanta constitution ralph mcgill predicts the various movements of today the sitins the freedom rides and the moves for equal citizenship which the constitution and the statutes provide are not going away until the admitted injustices are removed this in essence is the souths dilemma what will this mean to the negro what will it mean to the white man what will be the response these questions must be faced and answered for the negro the challenge will mean an identification as an american involved in the whole stream of american life this does not mean that he will have to surrender his racial heritage he may have to lose some sense of race he will surely have to lose the sense of inferiority which was fostered in him by the white man he will have to do something on his own initiative without making excuses about the crime and illegitimacy and school dropouts among his people even though he knows that poor and crowded housing and lack of job opportunities are the cause of these ills he will have to assume the responsibility for their remedy the causes cannot absolve him from solutions in addition the negro will have to help close the cultural gap between the races this will be true particularly for the southern negro even though he has wrought the major part of his own transformation from slave to responsible citizen he will have to erase the educational deficiencies occasioned by a separate but unequal school system he will have to compete on a professional level by a single standard for educational and job advancement it also follows that the negro in both the north and the south will have to take full and responsible advantage of the rights and privileges he fought for and gained this includes the ballot he will have to look with sympathy and understanding upon the agony of change whether it be in the white man or the black man he will have to learn that compromise is not synonymous with surrender whatever bitterness he has toward the white man he will have to forget understanding and a consideration for others form the only firm basis for a truly democratic society accomplished integration will have moral implications for the white man in america it will mean first that he must become concerned enough about racial discrimination and injustices that are beyond the reaches of the law to want to do something about them solon is reported to have said upon being asked the condition for perfect justice in athens it will come when those who have not suffered injustice are as indignant as those who have but it is not enough simply to be aware the white man will have to express his indignation in positive action the challenge of personal compliance will mean also that there must be a recognition and an understanding of the negro as a human being the white man will have to give back to the negro the humanity he took away and in so doing regain that portion of his own humanity he lost when he took the negros humanity away it will mean that he must accept with his heart as well as his mind that the negro is a person who possesses the same virtues same faults and foibles same inadequacies same sensibilities same aspirations and hopes and dreams as those he a white man has it will mean the rejection of paternalism however well intentioned yet it will mean the lending of a hand to the negro as both work to close the cultural and educational gap for which he the white man is largely responsible it means having the perceptive insight to know that he has no more to fear from the negro than from any other man in a competitive society for the white south particularly it will mean that the ibsenian ghosts of the past shall no longer rule the life in the present it will mean that the monolithic structure of myth and subterfuge by which the south has denied the negro the basic rights of american citizenship must be demolished it will mean that in this region where both black and white are so deeply rooted and which both love well the freedom road must be no dual highway but one broad expanse where white and black travel together in mutual respect and finally it will mean that christian practice will follow christian ethics to accomplish all this will require the reaching of a moral and intellectual height seldom attained by human beings it calls for more than shallow sentimentality and the remote compassion of northern liberals and southern moderates as the negro moves ahead impatiently and forcefully the challenge will be a direct one assaulting the lives of every american including those who have thus far been peaceably bypassed by the problems and what will be tomorrows promise the feet of the peacock will be beautiful like its body the way they ought to be jazz elder statesman by herbert l wheeldin herever popular w music is played in the united states and that is just about everywhere the name of george gershwin is known and admired among composers he is accorded a preeminent position that is remarked annually in festivals memorials and longplaying tributes less wellknown however is the name of the man who introduced him to jazz gave him his first lessons and enabled gershwin to make the transition from his classical outlook to the sounds of the new music then sweeping the country it was a fortunate day in the short life of gershwin when the great comic artist bert williams first presented him to his teacher and sponsorluckey roberts today roberts endowed with a memory like a strip of photographic film sits and recalls gershwin as though he lived yesterday he reaches back across the years as if they were days torn from a desk calendar yes he tells us i remember george so clearly back in he was selling sheet music at remicks on th st he was burning with ambition to learn the fingering for ragtime piano as jazz was called at the time he nearly threw a fit when i played my composition junkman rag for him the stride beat the crossfingering and the complicated chords were all quite contrary to his classical training but he was quick he had a natural gift for music later on he borrowed from my tune and then ill come back to you in order to write his famous the man i love and even today when i play the two tunes back to back they sound like a couple of peas spit from the same mouth luckey roberts or charles luckeyeth as he was baptized in philadelphia looks back over a career spanning years in the world of entertainment during that time he has attained the proportions of a legend in theatrical and music circles even while he remains unknown to the public at large despite this anonymity he may well be one of the great show personalities of our time his twinkling eyes are deepset in a buddhashaped face creased by a broadbrimmed smile with skin the color of peanut butter short of stature with rolypoly figure he projects an infectious zestful charm that insistently compels his listeners attention indeed his charm a kind of personality magic has affected some of the greatest members of our countrys social establishments who have sought his services and advice for his roster of musical clients and students reads like a rollcall of the social register one of his most publicized pupils was the prince of wales known to our era as the duke of windsor the onetime king of england who yielded his throne for love of an american divorcee again roberts unlocks his memory files when the prince first came here in he was the lion of the social season i remember playing at receptions in his honor for seventeen successive nights at one in particular the sanfords laddiea famous polo player spent for a single nights entertainment why their estate out on long island was decorated for miles around with wax candles it took the servants three hours just to light them up and the princehe was crazy about our music he hung around the bandstand all night and never seemed happier than when i let him sit in on the drums he sort of fancied himself with the brushes from that time on i became his mentor and gave him lessons in rhythm later even after he became king i used to send him records and sheet music so he could keep up with jazz undoubtedly roberts great musical gifts and winning personality made it possible for him to transcend the deep social gulf that separates the negro from the upper strata of society when the young son of president roosevelt wed the daughter of the dupont empire back in paul whiteman was bypassed to insure that luckey roberts should preside over the musical end of the festivities for season after season his orchestras supplied a steady stream of rhythms at the receptions and the cotillions of j p morgan commodore vanderbilt andrew carnegie marquis de cuevas and numerous other families who comprised americas as they were then called and till this day roberts fondly remembers what an apt pupil at the piano was doris duke heiress to the camel cigarette fortune but it is not for his associations that he deserves a footnote in negro history rather is it for his genuine creative abilities which have contributed so much to the growth of popular music in america and the world millions of people are sentimentally indebted to him for his inimitable composition moonlight cocktail an alltime favorite among popular tunes on hearing its lilting melody many persons invariably identify it with glenn miller who made it the musical signature of his orchestra few are aware that roberts composed this song way back in under the title ripples of the nile it proved so difficult for musicians and singers that it lay dormant for over years originally it was a fast number with right hand figuration of the greatest technical difficulty and none of luckeys pupils including the famous james p johnson could execute it perfectly subsequently he found it necessary to score it as a slow number and publish it as moonlight cocktail recently a new england newspaper the hartford courant referred to roberts as the grand old man of jazz music and truthfully speaking roberts is perhaps the oldest living founder of jazz and popular music not only gershwin but rodgers ellington berlin loesser fats waller and all the noted composers are obligated to him in some measure for they benefited by the creative dimension and prodigious technique he brought to jazz he was among the first to apply the contrapuntal effects of bach to jazz and is regarded among musicians as a master of the intricate meshing of counterpoint harmony and rhythm essential to the production of solid music can african students get a better education in africa by brooks johnson african students j studying in the united states this represents an increase of more than per cent over the totals for the academic year it is expected that the percentage increase will continue to rise for it costs approximately a year to maintain a student in the u s for a year this means that approximately was spent to educate african students in the u s for the academic year if the present trend continues we can confidently assume that this year we will see this figure increase another four to six million dollars bringing the total for the year to between and there should rest in no ones mind any doubt that this represents a sizable expenditure to educate people who are nationals of other nations before we proceed further it might help to briefly examine and explore possible motivations for such expenditures the u s population represents nearly per cent of the total world population but it produces per cent of the worlds food supply and consumes all but per cent of this supply at home most of the remainder is shamefully stored at government expense in warehouses the u s has more than times as many possessions as the rest of the world it has times as much steel times as much coal and times as much general equipment as the rest of the world but more than half of the people of the world dont know how to read and write go to bed hungry at night have never heard of jesus christ more than half of them have however heard of marx stalin khrushchev and their ideologies i think these statistics will give the reader some indication why the u s is spending so much money educating nationals from abroad in america for a moment it would be good to utilize a device used in an article by mr henry smith leipur a field secretary for the american bible society let us assume that the world has been compressed to a population of people americans would represent a grand total of most of the remaining would be hungry most of the time the american would eat per cent more than the maximum food requirements they could actually save money by giving the excess food away that they store each year is it any wonder the american having an average income of a year find that they are forced to pay on an average of a year for defense they spend less than a year for gifts other than private and personal gifts one can easily raise the question about the real meaning of the christian faith spirit of christmas peace on earth and good will among men as applied and practiced by the american when these figures are compared it probably is amply apparent that americans dont give as much as perhaps they should or could but still our amounts far exceed those of russia or any other nation americans in terms of dollars and cents give more than any other two nations combined our concern here however will be whether or not america is spending its dollars wisely regarding the education of africans there is a growing feeling among some interested parties that the best place to educate africans is in africa unesco leaders in the congo leopoldville advise if the congo is to have the leadership it desperately needs the congolese must remain here for their higher education or at least in africa from chad comes the report that what is sometimes considered a humorous observation is all too true in too many instances it goes african students if they do return from study abroad come back from soviet countries antired but from paris they return as avowed communists mr m a kabangi congolese minister of planning and coordination says i believe that the hope for peace and progress in this country as in all the new republics of africa is education at every level education in africa for african living in close touch with african cultures and african needs and increasingly by africans themselves to achieve this we need the help of individuals and organizations from abroad who will honestly put our need and the common good of all peoples above their own individual or national interests and prestige by providing their educational help here with many teachers coming to us instead of taking our higher students away with big grants for foreign study the above quotes come from an on the spot report prepared by martha lucas pate a first report on higher education in africa let us consider a case in point in one of the finest universities in africa was founded in the belgian congo lovanium university has been described as being so extensive so handsome and so wellequipped that ones first visit is like seeing a mirage here are some of the reasons for such a statement the university has many modern buildings that are spaciously located on the cam pus which overlooks leopoldville and the valley of the congo river the science laboratories are equipped with advanced and complex equipment not to mention the atomic reactor of which it is the proud possessor the main library has in excess of volumes with regular incoming volumes numbering over in addition there are smaller libraries affiliated with special schools of study such as law medicine bed hospital philosophy science theology social science agronomy psychology and teaching as well as the several museums and the university press the total cost for what was only partially described on the previous page was the equivalent of the university is now equipped to give an education to students the total enrollment is only this is a very interesting fact when one is constantly being reminded how greatly american colleges are overcrowded when asked by mrs pate if the students did any work toward defraying the cost of their education she was told by the assistant rector if we required any physical work there would be no students here they would all accept scholarships abroad when an african student comes to the u s to study the direct benefits of his coming accrue mostly to him the same money that is necessary to educate him here in the u s could be used in africa to establish facilities to educate more people and the process would be repeated over and over again with resultant benefits to a much wider spectrum of the population this fact when taken with certain other considerations would seem to indicate that the most practical and economical use of money to educate africans would be to spend it building african institutions in africa if an african student comes to america and his stay here is a success he is most reluctant to return thus partially defeating the purpose of his coming if he has really benefitted from his stay then there are many scholarships and awards to tempt him to extend his stay even longer if he takes his ba ma and phd here it means he will have been exposed to american standards for more than years after this time it is even more difficult for him to return if on the other hand his stay is not a success what have we accomplished we have exposed him to all the disadvantages of the american democracy and its ideosyncracies and he is a very receptive sounding board for antiamerican propaganda having actually been in america he becomes even more convincing in his arguments against her to his people as one who has returned he of course is in a much better position to lead his country and determine policies than one who hasnt it is not intended to imply that all africans should be limited to studying in africa but it is suggested that many africans are studying in america who would better serve the needs of their own nations by studying at home with american encouragement and aid things happen too swiftly in africa for its gifted nationals to be away from it for extended lengths of time surely there are certain postdoctorate and doctorate scholars who would greatly benefit from study in the u s and in turn the u s would greatly benefit from having invited them this would no doubt be the case at any time and regardless of the educational facilities in africa or the u s but the wholesale luring away of the best young african talent at this time doesnt appear to be the wisest expenditure of educational resources it would appear that economical political propagandaselfish and unselfish and educational considerations dictate that most africans should be educated in africa recently the author had occasion to speak with mr joseph kasongo former president of the chamber of deputies from the congo and presently serving a term as a national deputy i put the idea of educating africans in africa as it appears here a broad smile coyly spread across his face as he informed me that he had given a speech in the chamber of deputies with the very same message and import he put to me what he felt was a crippling consideration certainly the american dollars could buy very fine facilities and buildings perhaps even more than necessary in some cases there was no doubt in many africans minds that the needs of africa and the policies of the u s could best be served by educating africans at home there is certainly no doubt that such programs would have the additional beneficial effect of helping local economies but there still remained for him this one devastating problem who would educate the students in most of the better universities in america there are compulsory retirement ages usually in too many cases these men are still very capable and creative there are literally hundreds of professors emeriti who would more than welcome the opportunity and challenge of plying their talents and vast knowledge to adequatelyequipped schools in africa sponsored by american capital and encouraged by u s goodwill there is currently a great interest in american universities in establishing african studies programs new departments devoted to this field are springing up in colleges around the country almost as fast as football coaches lose their jobs the graduates of these programs usually hold advanced degrees and would welcome the opportunity to teach their various areas of study abroad there are many professors who for various other reasons and considerations would gladly accept teaching positions abroad as mr kasongo heard of these possible professional recruits he punctuated the remarks by pounding his fist in his hand with satisfaction he was evidently sold on the idea of educating africans in africa and the desirability feasibility and advantages of such a scheme his final words spoken with great deliberation and concern now if we can only convince the government of the united states of the merit of this these words stiff point up the pertinent and decisive factors by alf wannenburgh hree men stood in v rjp the dust and looked i at roadsign in two days we shall be in our homecountry said tsolo tsolo maki and temba had been many days on the road to the valley of a thousand hills during the day they walked in the yellow dirt beneath the sun and at night they lighted their fires beside the road and allowed their weariness to drain into the thirsting earth they spoke little for the horror of the place they had left remained with them more than four hundred of their fellow miners had died in the disaster and after three weeks of vain efforts to reach those who had been cut off from them by the fall of rock a funereal quiet had fallen over the workings the silent the sullen the weeping the bewildered wives and relatives who had pressed around the fence had gone and in their place torn newspapers were impaled on the wire barbs by the wind the silent winding gear cut a stark silhouette against the grey sky and the activity of the compound became the despairing preparation for departure of a refugee transit camp the heat of this sun is heavy on our shoulders like the burden of the white mans laws said tsolo freeing his arms and dropping his pack in the dust at his feet or like the suffering of our people at the mine said maki there are some things we shall not speak of said tsolo we will change the laws of the white man but the suffering at the mine can never be changed for a moment they were silent because it was with sadness that they remembered the suffering at the mine let us stay here for the night so that we shall be strong for the walk tomorrow said temba no rather we should walk through the night because then we shall be home by tomorrow evening said maki now that i am almost home my legs are strong and know no tiredness we will stay here said tsolo he led the way through a break in the fence and they followed him into the deeplyetched dry riverbed and that was the way it had always been tsolo was the leader when they had been at home together it had been tsolo who led them to plough and when the inadequate soil had become poor and the crops had failed they had followed him to the labourrecruiting office once they had even followed him to prison but that had been a long time ago his will was the strongest and that was the way it had always been this is a good place said tsolo dropping his blankets in the sand at the foot of the steep bank it would be better if we went where the river turns and where we cannot be seen from the road said maki in this place there is danger there was a silence and then his voice returned there is danger is danger danger who is it that mocks us said maki it is a trick of the hills tsolo replied temba placed his blanket roll firmly beside that of tsolo this is a good place he agreed f so they sat for a while in the fading warmth of the sand and watched the shadow of the bank creep across the riverbed it was tsolo who spoke first do you remember that we came through a fence to get here yes said temba it was you who found the opening for us and what does it mean that we came through a fence it means that we are on the land of a white farmer now if i tell you that my stomach is making the rumbling sounds of hunger then i would say that on a farm such as this there are sheep ah you are a good fellow temba how shall i say a good fellow tsolo said slapping temba on the back yes a very good fellow temba felt good it is from you that i have learnt these things he said their talk sounded faintly in the background of makis thoughts he thought of the joy of the homecoming that was before him and the sorrow of the place that lay behind him of his escape from the falling rocks that had entombed the miners and of the talk that it had happened because of the white mineowners those who had not provided for their safety he thought too of his friend moses yes moses who had lost his life in the disaster only two days before he was due to leave the mine two days before he was to return to his family only two days of how happy he had been and of the laughter in his eyes when he had spoken of his home and then there had been the sound like the report of a great gun and the ceiling of the mine had fallen on his dreams then he remembered the first few days when they had laboured with hope and the many days that followed when they struggled to clear the broken earth without hope but mostly he thought of home and of the anxious period of waiting while those who were returning to mozambique boarded their trains when the three of them knew that their wives would have heard of the sadness that had come to the mine and would worry for their safety then they had been told that they would have to wait a further two weeks for transport to their homecountry and tsolo had rolled up his blankets and spoken and they had followed him he is a dreamer this maki said tsolo yes and a fool for when we speak of sheep we are speaking of food said temba you want me to worry with food when my mind is filled with much bigger things said maki in two days i shall be home with my wife my son will ask me to tell him stories of the things i have seen we shall sit beside the fire and then i shall tell him of the painful things that i have seen in being with my family there is far greater pleasure than in answering the squeals of my stomach am i therefore a dreamer what you have learnt of life is like nothing said tsolo you have learnt to cut coal and to dream but you have learnt no wisdom he spoke with the bitter dust of the road in his voice we cannot live on dreams said temba you speak of home said tsolo but what is this home if it is not a patch of poor soil on which our families must starve if we do not find work on the mines so that we can send money to our children and you speak of this home as if it were heaven you are a dreamer just like the one at the mine who was called moses yes you are like moses shouted temba and the hills repeated you are like moses are like moses like moses i do not like this place we should leave for even the hills mock us for this talk of stealing sheep when we should be on the road said maki ah so now our dreamer is afraid of an echo jeered temba come said tsolo let us leave him to his dreams or his fears there is mens work for us to do but why should we do this thing now when we are so near to home said maki we may be caught and then it will be many days before we can continue on our path these farmers fear us because they are ignorant of us this fear sometimes causes them to do terrible things to us i have my knife ready let us find a sheep said temba yes then let us go said tsolo maki you will make the fire for us while we are gone if we are caught it will be many days he shouted after them as they moved beyond the lip of the bank and they did not reply but the hills answered it will be many days be many days many days then darkness and silence came to the bed of the river and the cold breeze of solitude was chill upon him beyond the towering blackness of the opposite bank filtered light from the invisible moon wove the fabric of the sky with blue threads he gathered the driftwood of a longpast flood and heaped it against a boulder in the sandy centre of the place where the stream had been in the warmth of the flames he felt the companionship of his family if he excluded all else the dancing yellow forms created about him the walls of his hut the gentle love of his wife and he heard the thirsty questions of his son beside him and he planned how he would tell of the many long roads he had traversed to be with him and still he is dreaming the voice of tsolo scorned from out of the dark maki shook himself free of his thoughts as the two figures stepped into the light first tsolo carrying the knife and then temba with the carcass of a sheep slung over his shoulder ha said temba he has not even watched the fire wellmust it also die take this said tsolo handing maki the knife we men have done our worknow it is for the one with the heart of a woman to prepare the sheep for the cooking but if we are found with the blood of this sheep on our hands we shall not reach home said maki must we not eat if we are to have strength for the journey tomorrow said temba you dream of dangerthere is no one here jeered tsolo and the hills confirmed there is no one here is no one here no one here with the knife in his hand maki stood erect before the glowing coals my strength does not come from that which belongs to other men he said tsolo became angry do we not cut coal so that they become rich do we not build roads so that they can drive on them while we must walk has not everything that they have been taken from us you worry because we take this sheep they have taken all from useven our strength but i am already strong shouted maki because i am almost home from the bank above them came a challenge and the sharp crack of a shotgun tsolo and temba fled from the light and vanished into the blackness where the river turned out of sight of the road just beyond the ragged circle of firelight illuminated by the weakening flare lay three bundles of blankets and beside the fire two crumpled heaps the sheep and maki and the hills mocked i am almost home am almost home almost home tales of childhood by john a williams the day joey procopio got his new t sled we all went up to yates castle to slide joeys sled was one of the new ones a flexible flyer if youve known sleds you know theres not much streamlining they can do with them but joeys was as sleek as the empire state express our slide was through bare chestnut maple and oak trees down a hill of about degrees there was a huge oak at the greatest depth of the decline at which we began our turn to keep from shooting over the sidewalk and down into the street we slid all afternoon joey would occasionally allow one of us to use his sled we all agreed that his flexible flyer was the fastest thing on runners we took our penultimate slides and gathered once more at the crest of the hill again for the last one we all went down before joey this time we didnt mind it seemed fitting that the owner of the flexible flyer should be the last one down kind of like a sea captain from the bottom of the hill we watched joey secure and proud in this honor start running with his sled moving it to and away from his body as he ran in crisp strides suddenly he tripped and as he crashed to the ground his head jerking upright to watch it the sled leaped from his hands as though it had a life of its own it sped over roots around bushes and trees speeding downhill its red runners were like streaks of blood against the snow and its golden boards flashed like bits of sun the sled hit the sidewalk and flew straight out into the street and landed on an even keel it was zipping across the roadway when the car came the driver thought a kid was on it and he swung this way and that and finally slammed on his brakes the car spun skidded then jerked out of it with a snap the sled squealing beneath one of its wheels so hard that the runners dug up the snow clear down to the asphalt the driver was shaking when he got out we could not move slowly the driver bent beneath the wheel of the car and looked he had his butt in the air like a chicken eating slowly like the air had been let out of him he sank to his knees and did not move for a long time we looked back up the hill then at joey who was still sprawled on his stomach the driver pulled the sled from beneath the wheel and kicked it to the curb the sled was shattered the runners crumpled the driver got back into his car and drove away slowly and in silence and in the cold which seemed to have come suddenly we clambered down crossed the road and looked at the sled joey came up last and when he saw it he started to cry and none of us could tell him he was lucky he hadnt been on it because he was anticipating the beating his father was going to give him er an cl son had been away two i y days and i was getting hungry tired of g stealing milk from porch stoops and fruits from hucksters some of whom were pretty swift afoot for old men i drifted nearer and nearer home as i approached it circled around it seeing the lights on in the living room i felt very unwanted and unlived i moved further away i walked aimlessly down townsend street which was being demolished for the new housing project only god knows how many of those abandoned homes id pilfered for lead to sell to mr ullman the junkman as i passed the gouged out foundations a voice called out my father i glanced once behind me then raced on up the street only my father and i were on it and he id seen at the first glance had been shopping at the black and yellow painted american store he was clutching two great bags the sight and sound of him immediately reassured me that i never wanted to go home again and so we raced at what age does a son outrace his father seventeen eighteen sixteen my father was a young man used to hard work and baseball and i was far from sixteen in fact i wasnt twelve yet we sped past the shells of homes which caught the sounds of our pantings and of our feet beating a crazy crescendo against the pavement and so we ran and i was pulling away half a foot by half a foot and i knew if i could last to the corner and make the alley i was gone i bent my head my knees came up faster the pavement socked against my toes i swear i could hear the wind racing by wind i was creating but when he called his footsteps falling further and further behind my son my son something within me broke and i slowed then stopped and sat down he trotted up and sat down beside me when we got up he handed me a bag he placed his free arm around my shoulder and its touch told me that it was not to restrain but to feel close i knew i was going to get it though but i went anyway the convert by lerone bennett jr man dont know what g hell do a man dont p know what he is till he gets his back pressed up against a wall now you take aaron lott there aint no other way to explain the crazy thing he did he was going along fine preaching the gospel saving souls and getting along with the white folks and then all of a sudden he felt wood pressing up against his back the funny thing was that nobody knew he was hurting till he preached that red sea sermon where he got mixed up and seemed to think mississippi was egypt as chairman of the deacons board i felt it was my duty to reason with him i appreciated his position and told him so but i didnt think it was right for him to push us all in a hole the old foolhe just laughed brother booker he said the lordhell take care of me i knew then that that man was heading for trouble and the very next thing he did confirmed it the white folks called the old fool downtown to bear witness that the colored folks were happy and you know what he did he got down there amongst all them big white folks and he said things aint gonna change here overnight but they gonna change its inevitable the lord wants it well sir you could have bought them white folks for a penny aaron lott pastor of the rock of zion baptist church a man white folks had said was wise and sound and sensible had come closetoo closeto saying that the supreme court was coming to melina mississippi the surprising thing was that the white folks didnt do nothing there was a lot of mumbling and whispering but nothing had happened till the terrible morning when aaron came aknocking at the door of my funeral home now things had been tightening up you could feel it in the airand i didnt want no part of no crazy scheme and i told him so right off he walked on past me and sat down on the couch he had on his preaching clothes a shiny blue suit a fresh starched white shirt a black tie and his sunday black shoes i remember thinking at the time that aaron was too black to be wearing all them dark clothes the thought tickled me and i started to smile but then i noticed something about him that didnt seem quite right i ran my eyes over him closely he was kinda middlesized and he had a big cleanshaven head a big nose and thin lips i stood there looking at him for a long time but i couldnt figure out what it was till i looked at his eyes they were burning bright like light bulbs do just before they go out and yet he looked contented like his mind was resting somewheres else i wanna talk with you co booker he said glancing sideways at my wife if you dont mind sister brown m sarah got up and went into the living quarters aaron didnt say nothing for a long time he just sat there looking out the window then he spoke so soft i had to strain my ears to hear im leaving for the baptist convention he said he pulled out his gold watch and looked at it train leaves in bout two hours i know that aaron i was impatient for him to get on with it yeah but what i wanted to tell you was that i aint going jim crow im going first class booker right through the white waiting room thats the law a cold shiver ran through me aaron i said dont you go talking crazy now the old fool laughed a great big bodyshaking laugh he started talking bout god and jesus and all that stuff now im a godfearing man myself but i holds that god helps those who help themselves i told him so you cant mix god up with these white folks i said when you start to messing around with segregation theyll burn you up and the bible too he looked at me like i was satan i sweated over this thing he said i prayed i got down on my knees and i asked god not to give me this cup but he said was the one i heard him booker right herehe tapped his chestin my heart the old fools been having visions i thought i sat down and tried to figure out a way to hold him but he got up without saying a word and started for the door wait i shouted ill get my coat i dont need you he said i just came by to tell you so you could tell the board in case something happened you wait i shouted and ran out of the room to get my coat we got in his beatup old ford and went by the parsonage to get his suitcase rachelthat was his wifeand jonah were sitting in the living room wringing their hands aaron got his bag shook jonahs hand and said take care of your mamma boy jonah nodded aaron hugged rachel and pecked at her cheek rachel broke down she throwed her arms around his neck and carried on something awful aaron shoved her away dont go making no fuss over it woman i aint gonna be gone forever cant a man go to a church meeting thout women screaming and crying he tried to make light of it but you could see he was touched by the way his lips trembled he held his hand out to me but i wouldnt take it i told him off good told him it was a sin and a shame for a man of god to be carrying on like he was worrying his wife and everything im coming with you i said somebodys gotta see that you dont make a fool of yourself he shrugged picked up his suitcase and started for the door then he stopped and turned around and looked at his wife and his boy and from the way he looked i knew that there was still a chance he looked at the one and then at the other for a moment there i thought he was was going to cry but he turned quicklike and walked out of the door i ran after him and tried to talk some sense in his head but he shook me off turned the corner and went on up adams street i caught up with him and we walked in silence crossing the street in front of the first baptist church for whites going on around the confederate monument where once they hung a boy for fooling around with white women put it off aaron i begged sleep on it he didnt say nothing what you need is a vacation ill get the board to approve full pay and everything he smiled and shifted the suitcase over to his left hand big drops of sweat were running down his face and spotting up his shirt his eyes were awful all lit up and burning aaron aaron cant you hear me we passed the feed store bill williams grocery store and the movie house a mans gotta think about his family aaron a man aint free didnt you say that once didnt you he shaded his eyes with his hand and looked into the sun he put the suitcase on the ground and checked his watch why dont you think about jonah i asked answer that why dont you think about your own son i am he said thats exactly what im doing thinking about jonah matter of fact he started me to thinking i aint never mentioned it before but the boys been worrying me one day we was downtown here and he asked me something that hurt daddy he said how come you aint a man i got mad i did and told him i am a man he said that wasnt what he meant i mean he said how come you aint a man where white folks concerned i couldnt answer him booker ill never forget it till the day i die i couldnt answer my own son and i been preaching forty years he dont know nothing bout it i said hes hotheaded like my boy hell find out when he grows up i hopes not aaron said shaking his head i hopes not some white folks passed and we shut up till they were out of hearing aaron who was acting real strange looked up in the sky and moved his lips he came back to himself after a little bit and he said this thing of being a man booker is a big thing the supreme court cant make you a man the naacp cant do it god almighty can do a lot but even he cant do it aint nobody can do it but you he said that like he was preaching and when he got through he was all filled up with emotion and he seemed kind of ashamedhe was a man who didnt like emotion outside the church he looked at his watch picked up his bag and said well lets git it over with we turned into elm and the first thing i saw at the end of the street was the train station it was an old red building flat like a slab a group of white men were fooling around in front of the door i couldnt make them out from that distance but i could tell they werent the kind of white folks to be fooling around with we walked on passing the dry goods store the barber shop and the new building that was going up across the street from that was the sheriffs office i looked in the window and saw bull sampson sitting at his desk his feet propped up on a chair a fat brown cigar sticking out of his mouth a ball about the size of a sweet potato started burning in my stomach please aaron i said please you cant get away with it i know how you feel sometimes i feel the same way myself but i wouldnt risk my neck to do nothing for hese niggers they wont appreciate it theyll laugh at you we were almost to the station and i could make out the faces of the men sitting on the benches one of them must have been telling a joke he finished and the group broke out laughing i whispered to aaron im through with it i wash my hands of the whole mess i dont know whether he heard me or not he turned to the right without saying a word and went on in the front door the stringbeany man who told the joke was so shocked that his cigarette fell out of his mouth yall see that he said why ill shut up another man said go git bull i kept walking fast turned at the corner and ran around to the colored waiting room when i got in there i looked through the ticket window and saw aaron standing in front of the clerk aaron stood there for a minute or more but the clerk didnt see him and that took some not seeing in that room aaron lott stood out like a pig in a chicken coop there were id say about ten or fifteen people in there but didnt none of them move they just sat there with their eyes glued on aarons back aaron cleared his throat the clerk didnt look up he got real busy with some papers aaron cleared his throat again and opened his mouth to speak the screen door of the waiting room opened and clattered shut it got real quiet in that room hospital quiet it got so quiet i could hear my own heart beating now aaron knew who opened that door but he didnt bat an eyelid he turned around real slow and faced high sheriff sampson the baddest man in south mississippi mr sampson stood there with his legs wide open like the men you see on television his beefy face was bloodred and his gray eyes were rattlesnake hard he was mad no doubt about it i had never seen him so mad preacher he said you done gone crazy he was talking lowlike and mean nosir aaron said nosir mr sampson what you think you doing going to st louis mr sampson you must done lost yo mind boy mr sampson started walking towards aaron with his hand on his gun twenty or thirty men pushed through the front door and fanned out over the room mr sampson stopped about two paces from aaron and looked him up and down that look had paralyzed hundreds of niggers but it didnt faze aaron nonehe stood his ground im gonna give you a chance preacher git on over to the nigger side and git quick i aint bothering nobody mr sampson somebody in the crowd yelled dont reason wit the nigger bull hit em mr sampson walked up to aaron and grabbed him in the collar and throwed him up against the ticket counter he pulled out his gun did you hear me deacon i said git im going to st louis mr sampson thats cross state lines the court done said aaron didnt have a chance the blow came from nowhere laying there on the floor with blood spurting from his mouth aaron looked up at mr sampson and he did another crazy thing he grinned bull sampson jumped up in the air and came down on aaron with all his two hundred pounds it made a crunchy sound he jumped again and the mob maddened by the blood and heat moved in to help him they fell on aaron like mad dogs they beat him with chairs they beat him with sticks they beat him with guns till this day i dont know what come over me the first thing i know i was running and then i was standing in the middle of the white waiting room mr sampson was the first to see me he backed off cocked his pistol and said booker boy you come one mo step and ill kill you whats a matter with you niggers today all yall gone crazy please dont kill him i begged you aint got no call to treat him like that so you saw it all did you well then booker you musta saw the nigger preacher reach for my gun he didnt do that mr sampson i said he didnt mr sampson put a big hairy hand on my tie and pulled me to him booker he said sweetly you saw the nigger preacher reach for my gun didnt you i didnt open my mouthi couldnt i was so scaredbut i guess my eyes answered for me whatever mr sampson saw there musta convinced him cause he throwed me on the floor besides aaron git this nigger out of here he said and be quick about it dropping to my knees i put my hand on aarons chest i didnt feel nothing i felt his wrist i didnt feel nothing i got up and looked at them white folks with tears in my eyes i looked at the women sitting crying on the benches i looked at the men i looked at mr sampson i said he was a good man mr sampson said move the nigger a big sigh came out of me and i wrung my hands mr sampson said move the nigger he grabbed my tie and twisted it but i didnt feel nothing my eyes were glued to his hands there was blood under the fingernails and the fingersthey looked like fat little red sausages i screamed and mr sampson flung me down on the floor he said move the nigger i picked aaron up and fixed his body over my shoulder and carried him outside i sent for one of my boys and we dressed him up and put him away real nicelike and rachel and the boy came and they cried and carried on and yet somehow they seemed prouder of aaron than ever before and the colored folksthey seemed proud too crazy niggers didnt they know couldnt they see it hadnt done no good in fact things got worse the northern newspapers started kicking up a stink and mr rivers the solicitor announced they were going to hold a hearing all of a sudden booker taliaferro brown became the biggest man in that town my phone rang day and night i got threats i got promises and i was offered bribes everywhere i turned somebody was waiting to ask me whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna say to tell the truth i didnt know myself one day i would decide one thing and the next day would decide another it was mr rivers and mr sampson who called my attention to that they came to my office one day and called me a shifty nogood nigger they said they expected me to stand by my statement in the train station that i saw aaron reach for the gun i hadnt said no such thing but mr sampson said i said it and he said he had witnesses who heard me say it and if you say anything else he said i cant be responsible for your health now you knowhe put that bloody hand on my shoulder and he smiled his sweet death smileyou know i wouldnt threaten you but the boyshe shook his headthe boys are real worked up over this one it was long about then that i began to hate aaron lott im ashamed to admit it now but its true i hated him he had lived his life he had made his choice why should he live my life too and make me choose it wasnt fair it wasnt right it wasnt christian what made me so mad was the fact that nothing i said would help aaron he was dead and it wouldnt help one whit for me to say that he didnt reach for that gun i tried to explain that to rachel when she came to my office moaning and crying the night before the hearing listen to me woman i said listen aaron was a good man he lived a good life he did a lot of good things but hes dead dead dead nothing i say will bring him back bull sampsons got ten niggers who are going to swear on a stack of bibles that they saw aaron reach for that gun it wont do me or you or aaron no good for me to swear otherwise what did i say that for that woman liked to had a fit she got down on her knees and she begged me to go with aaron go wit him she cried booker booker if yous a man if yous a father if yous a friend go wit aaron that woman tore my heart up i aint never heard nobody beg like that please woman please i said please dont carry on like that tell the truth booker she said thats all im asking tell the truth truth i said hah thats all you niggers talk about truth what do you know about truth truth is eating good and sleeping good truth is living rachel be loyal to the living rachel backed off from me you would have thought that i had cursed her or something she didnt say nothing she just stood there pressed against the door she stood there saying nothing for so long that my nerves snapped say something i begged say somethinganything she shook her head slowly at first and then her head started moving like it wasnt attached to her body it went back and forth back and forth back and forth i started towards her but she jerked open the door and ran out into the night screaming that did it i ran across the room to the filing cabinet opened the bottom drawer and took out a dusty bottle of scotch i started drinking but the more i drank the soberer i got i guess i fell asleep cause i dreamed i buried rachel and that everything went along fine until she jumped out of the casket and started screaming i came awake with a start and knocked over the bottle i reached for a rag and my hand stopped in midair of course i said out loud and slammed my fist down on the scotchsoaked papers i didnt see nothing why didnt i think of it before i didnt see nothing jumping up i walked to and fro in the office would it work i rehearsed it in my mind all i could see was aarons back i dont know whether he reached for the gun or not all i know is that for some reason the men beat him to death rehearsing the thing in my mind i felt a great weight slip off my shoulders i did a little jig in the middle of the floor and went upstairs to my bed whistling sarah turned over and looked me up and down what you happy about cant a man be happy i asked she sniffed the air oh she said and pressed her lips together she turned over and mumbled something in her pillow it came to me then for the first time that she was bout the only person in town who hadnt asked me what i was going to do i thought about it for a little while shrugged and fell into bed with all my clothes on when i woke up the next morning i had a terrible headache and my tongue was a piece of sandpaper for a long while i couldnt figure out what i was doing laying there with all my clothes on then it came to me this was the big day i put on my black silk suit the one i wore for big funerals and went downstairs to breakfast i walked into the dining room without looking and bumped into russell the last person in the world i wanted to see he was my only child but he didnt act like it he was always finding fault he didnt like the way i talked to negroes he didnt like the way i talked to white folks he didnt like this he didnt like that and to top it off the young whippersnapper wanted to be an artist undertaking wasnt good enough for him he wanted to paint pictures i sat down and grunted good morning papa he said it like he meant it he wants something i thought looking him over closely noticing that his right eye was swollen you been fighting again boy yes papa you younguns education thats what it is education its ruining you he didnt say nothing he just sat there looking down when i looked up and looking up when i looked down this went on through the grits and the eggs and the second cup of coffee whatcha looking at i asked nothing papa whatcha thinking nothing papa you lying boy its written all over your face he didnt say nothing i dismissed him with a wave of my hand picked up the paper and turned to the sports page what are you going to do papa the question caught me unawares i know now that i was expecting it that i wanted him to ask it but he put it so bluntly that i was flabbergasted i pretended i didnt understand do bout what boy speak up about the trial papa i didnt say nothing for a long time there wasnt much in fact i could say so i got mad questions questions questions i shouted thats all i get in this housequestions you never have a civil word for your pa i go out of here and work my tail off and you keep yourself shut up in that room of yours looking at them fool books and now soon as your old man gets his back against the wall you join the pack i expected better than that of you boy a son ought to back his pa that hurt him he picked up the coffee pot and poured himself another cup of coffee and his hand trembled he took a sip and watched me over the rim they say you are going to chicken out papa chicken out what that mean theyre betting youll tom i leaned back in the chair and took a sip of coffee so theyre betting huh the idea appealed to me crazy niggerstheyd bet on a funeral i saw pain on his face he sighed and said i bet too papa the cup fell out of my hand and broke spilling black water over the tablecloth you did what i bet you wouldnt tom you little fool i fell out laughing and then i stopped suddenly and looked at him closely how much you bet one hundred dollars i stood up youre lying i said whered you get that kind of money from mamma sarah i shouted sarah you get in here what kind of house you running sneaking behind my back giving this boy money to gamble with sarah leaned against the door jamb she was in her hot iron mood there was no expression on her face and her eyes were hard i gave it to him booker she said they called you an uncle tom he got in a fight about it he wanted to bet on you booker he believes in you suddenly i felt old and used up i pulled a chair to me and sat down please i said waving my hand please go away leave me alone please i sat there for maybe ten or fiften minutes thinking praying the phone rang it was mr withers the president of the bank i had put in for a loan and it had been turned down but mr withers said thered been a mistake new fellow you know he said clucking his tongue he said he knew that it was my lifelong dream to build a modern funeral home and to buy a cadillac hearse he said he sympathized with that dream supported it thought the town needed it and thought i deserved it the loan will go through he said drop by and see me this morning after the hearing when i put that phone down it was wet with sweat i couldnt turn that new funeral home down and mr withers knew it my father had raised me on that dream and before he died he made me swear on a bible that i would make it good and here it was on a platter just for a word a word that wouldnt hurt nobody but what about russell hed understand hed have to understand five or ten years from now i told myself he will have forgotten that it ever happened i put on my hat and hurried to the courthouse i was in a hurry to get it over with when they called my name i walked in with my head held high the courtroom was packed the white folks had all the seats and the colored folks were standing in the rear whoever arranged the seating had set aside the first two rows for white men they were sitting almost on top of each other looking mean and uncomfortable in their best white shirts i walked up to the bench and swore on the bible and took a seat mr rivers gave me a little smile and waited for me to get myself set state your name he said booker taliaferro brown i took a quick look at the first two rows and recognized at least ten of the men who killed aaron and your age fiftyseven youre an undertaker yessir you been living in this town all your life yessir you like it here dont you booker was this a threat i looked mr rivers in the face for the first time he smiled i told the truth i said yessir now calling your attention to the day of may th did anything unusual happen on that day the question threw me i shook my head then it dawned on me he was talking about yessir i said thats the day aaron got something in mr rivers face warned me and i pulled up thats the day of the trouble at the train station mr rivers smiled he looked like a trainer whod just put a monkey through a new trick you could feel the confidence and the contempt oozing out of him i looked at his prissy little mustache and his smiling lips and i got mad lifting my head a little bit i looked him full in the eyes i held the eyes for a moment and i tried to tell the man behind the eyes that i was a man like him and that he didnt have no right to be using me and laughing about it but he didnt get the message the bastardhe chuckled softly turned his back to me and faced the audience i believe you were with the preacher that day the water was getting deep i scroonched down in my seat closed the lids of my eyes and looked dense yessir mr rivers i drawled ah was ah was now booker he turned around i believe you tried to keep the nigger preacher from getting out of line i hesitated it wasnt a fair question finally i said yessir you begged him not to go in the white side yessir and when that failed you went over to your sidethe colored side and looked through the window yessir he put his hand in his coat pocket and studied my face you saw everything didnt you just about a muscle on the inside of my thigh started tingling mr rivers shuffled some papers he had in his hand he seemed to be thinking real hard i pushed myself against the back of the chair mr rivers pounced he moved close quick and stabbed his finger into my chest booker did you see the nigger preacher reach for mr sampsons gun he backed away smiling i looked away from him and i felt my heart trying to tear out of my skin i looked out over the courtroom it was still wasnt even a fly moving i looked at the white folks in front and the colored folks in back and i turned the question over in my mind while i was doing that waiting taking my time i noticed out of the corner of my eye that the smile on mr rivers face was dying away suddenly i had a terrible itch to know what that smile would turn into i said nosir mr rivers stumbled backwards like he had been shot old judge sloan took off his glasses and pushed his head out over the bench the whole courtroom seemed to be leaning in to me and i saw aarons widow leaning back with her eyes closed and it seemed to me at that distance that her lips were moving in prayer mr rivers was the first to recover he put his smile back on and he acted like my answer was in the script you mean he said that you didnt see it it happened so quickly that you missed it i looked at the bait and i ain t gonna lie i was tempted he knew as well as i did what i meant but he was gambling on my weakness i had thrown away my funeral home my hearse everything i owned and he was standing there like a magician pulling them out of a hat one at a time dangling them saying looka here looka here dont they look pretty i was on top of a house and he was betting that if he gave me a ladder i would come down he was wrong but you cant fault him for trying he hadnt never met no nigger who would go all the way i looked him in the eye and went the last mile aaron didnt reach for that gun i said them people they just fell on hold it he shouted i want to remind you that there are laws in this state against perjury you can go to jail for five years for what you just said now know youve been conferring with those naacp fellows but i want to remind you of the statements you made to sheriff sampson and me judge he dismissed me with a wave of his hand judge this man he caught himself and it was my turn to smilethis boy is lying ten niggers have testified that tney saw the preacher reach for the gun twenty white people saw it youve heard their testimony i want to withdraw this witness and i want to reserve the right to file perjury charges against him judge sloan nodded he pushed his bottom lip over his top one you can step down he said i want to warn you that perjury is a very grave offense you judge i didnt nigger he banged his gavel dont you interrupt me now git out of here two guards pushed me outside and waved away the reporters billy giles mr sampsons assistant came out and told me mr sampson wanted me out of town before sundown and he says youd better get out before the northern reporters leave he wont be responsible for your safety after that i nodded and went on down the stairs and started out the door booker rachel and a whole line of negroes were running down the stairs i stepped outside and waited for them rachel ran up and throwed her arms around me it dont take but one booker she said it dont take but one somebody else said they whitewashed it they whitewashed it but you spoiled it for em russell came out then and stood over to the side while the others crowded around to shake my hands then the others sensed that he was waiting and they made a little aisle he walked up to me kind of slowlike and he said thank you sir that was the first time ic his whole years that that boy had said sir to me i cleared my throat and when i opened my eyes sarah was standing beside me she didnt say nothing she just put her hand in mine and stood there it was long about then i guess when i realized that i was seeing so good hey say i cried but i dont believe a word of it it was such a hot day and the sun was shining so bright that the sweat rolling down my face blinded me i wiped the sweat out of my eyes and some more people came up and said a lot of foolish things about me showing the white folks and following in aarons footsteps i wasnt doing no such fool thing ol man rivers just put the thing to me in a way it hadnt been put beforeman to man it was simple really any man would have done it conakry by hoyt w fuller had been in the i republic of guinea r more than a week be fore i decided to do u u something about a haircut not that my hair had grown so much in that brief span of time it had taken ten days by ocean liner to reach conakry from palma de mallorca and my last visit to the barbers had been a week prior to sailing which meant i was overdue by approximately two weeks for my customary fortnightly trimming in africa it was easy to forget that i needed a haircut african men products of cultures which assign no stigma of inferiority to the texture of their hair find no virtue in cropping it close so thatas is the case with negroes in america it can be brushed or pressed straight with oil or pomade and since most of the local citizens wore their hair long i did not feel overly conscious of the thickening of my hair as i would have in amer ica but i had not forgotten the need entirely for lifelong habits are not so easily abandoned as all that and it was probably natural that i should have found aliounes haircut distracting it was a real airconditioned job perfect for the muggy heat rather thick on top but thin at the sides and rear and among the shaggythatched africans thronging the cramped drinking place it was eyecatching the haircuts wearer was no less arresting than his coiffure he was tall and broadshouldered with full molded features and deepset eyes that gave his handsome face a saturnine air he seemed aloof insofar as that was physically possible standing away from the counter near the wall i saw that the beer in his hand was not the local brew favoredprobably because of its lower priceby most people in the place and i concluded that he was an economic cut above his fellows i was chatting with the proprietor a fat sealmoist frenchman whose disaffection for america and things american bordered on the obsessive on the first evening i here as vhrecheeintent pjy he was wandered into his place seeking some congenial spot where ordinary guineans congregated he shook his heacmhffioaned dark i ows i w k t ly the ame if i represent ion of some on driving him in the midst oiisiippitarangue against barbaric america when he realized that my attention had shifted to the african ah that is alioune he said a fine fellow we are good friends he comes here to talk with me called the african and when the man had made his way to the counter announced rather ambiguously alioune this gentleman is an american alioune shook hands but said nothing only stared into my face when as a means of ending the unseemly silence i asked of his health he merely replies va bien msieur and continued to stare i suppose that i expected him to ask the usual questionswhy was i in guinea what did i think of it how long would i remain but if he was curious he did not indicate it i was drinking a large bottle of perrier as i always did on my visits to the tavernas i shall call it for the establishment eluded classification if was a sort of combination bartavern and general store a place so unpretentious that it had no name and needed none its facade resembled the rather desolate saloons in hollywood western movies and the interior even less impressive consisted of a huge room divided by a solid weathered counter with a third of the space reserved for customers who had to be served standing up there being no facilities for sitting the remainder of the room was incongruously mostly empty space surrounded by shelves holding a paltry selection of wines tinned foods such household items as soap and oil candy and other confections a doorway at the rear led to an invisible refrigerator where beverages were kept and to the living quarters of the proprietor and his sylphslender darkhaired and wistful wife apart from providing my daily quota of water replenishing that wrung from my pores by the sun the perrier gave me an excuse for calling at the tavern alioune regarded my bottle of water as a healthy man regards the medicines of a hypochondriac and invited me to have a beer thank you very much i said but i wont have any space left for beer after i finish this bottle why do you drink bottled water he asked somewhat suspiciously i explained that my system tended to react unpleasantly and sometimes violently to unaccustomed climates and water and that i felt the mineral water was wiser under the circumstances that explanation did not take into account the influence of many warnings of the dire consequences of drinking unboiled water in africa but it was substantially truthful the proprietor leaning over the counter shook his tousled dusty gray head and laughed he is so american he said to alioune the american black people are more american than the americans it was a marvelous statement loaded with terrible accusations against some eighteen million americans the most serious charge being that they lay claim to a heritage that is not their own it is an indictment bom of the fact of the alienation and degradation of american negroes but it fails to consider another fact that is at least as inescapablethat whether happily or regrettably it is as impossible to separate negroes from the complex entity that is america as it is to isolate the yeast from bread but it was easy to overlook these misconceptions in a foreigner when they are shared by so many americans who have no excuse for not knowing better but the implication that there was something uniquely indicative in an americans drinking a beverage that is bottled and widely sold in france and her dependent territories was frankly puzzling i said so ah you americans are so antiseptic the frenchman declared you are like women afraid of a few germs the frenchman was grinding an ax and it was useless to expect reason from him so i left his remark unchallenged when he moved off to attend to business i told alioune that i liked his haircut and asked if he would tell me where he had gotten it alioune regarded me speculatively the african barbershop is not very modern he said after a moment perhaps you would prefer a european barbershop not particularly i replied with some surprise i thought i would like a haircut similar to yours he nodded neutrally the barbershop is near the gare de voitures behind the hotel monkarin i said i had not the slightest idea where that was and he nodded again if you are free now i will show you we called out goodbye to the frenchman and maneuvered through the sweatscented mob to the door alioune led the way up the dusty street making no effort to converse answering my questions with elaborate economy of words near the boulevard du niger he pointed to a shop sandwiched between a jewelers and a bootmakers a sign reading coiffeur pour messieurs over the door perhaps you want this european shop msieur it is said that american black men do not prefer the society of africans you will be more comfortable here i would like to see your shop if you dont mind i persisted i refrained from asserting that i had traveled thousands of miles to seek the society of africans we continued past the hotel du niger across the tip of the aromatic market now almost deserted in the approaching dusk and down a wide street flanked on one side by the rear wall of the massive market building and on the other by a series of clothing shops these shops owned by middle easterners all seemed to be stocked with duplicate merchandise they featured during business hours small platoons of african men who sat out front at desks or behind machines sewing on the spot the garments sold inside their productstrousers shirts and blue and white moslem bouboushung from racks beneath the porticoes at the end of the street situated in a tiny plaza stood the threestory hotel monkarin a dusty ochrecolored building reminiscent of a chicago flophouse behind it was the gare du voitures an openair garage and service station attended by idle dandies and garrulous motorcar afficionados alioune said nothing until we crossed the street behind the hotel and stood on the edge of the premises of the gare de voitures it is here he said then indicating a structure directly in front of us he had turned so that he was looking squarely in my face measuring my reaction my attempt at suppressing my disappointment was hardly successful i had not expected an establishment that compared with the european barbershop but i was unprepared for what i saw the building could be charitably described as a leanto about half the size of a onecar garage through the open door most of the interior was visible a long shelf along the rear wall held several pieces of mirror and a variety of powders lotions combs and brushes the shelf as well as the floor was covered with dust of at least several days accumulation and hair layered the floor like a ragged carpet there were three chairs each presently occupied and three busy barbers and several men sat on benches in the corners awaiting their turns alioune gestured for me to enter and i stepped inside momentarily forgetting my own six feet plus and striking my head against the low ceiling as a consequence alioune spoke to the center barber apparently the manager and he stopped work to greet us this is an american gentleman alioune presented me he would like a haircut all faces turned to regard me i straightened slightly from my stooped stance trying to appear less ridiculous than i felt the barber saluted me politely told me he would personally cut my hair and asked that i take a seat on the bench and wait a few moments i told him that i had not the time for a haircut as it was growing late and that i would return the following day it was a lame excuse and i had a mental picture of aliounes nod of satisfaction behind my back very well msieur the barber said how much is a haircut i asked one hundred and fifty francs msieur i thanked the barber and stepped outside again there alioune and i shook hands exchanged formal pleasantries and went off in opposite directions the smug expression never left his face i did not meet alioune in the tavern again until two evenings later in the meantime i continued the practice of dropping in for a perrier morning and evening during the day the proprietor worked as building contractor in the surrounding area and madame ran the business with the help of a boy who sold ice from the shed adjoining the tavern many customers were women and children some of whom spoke little or virtually no french one of these was a morosefaced girl of eight or nine a bean pole of a child who regularly sauntered in bearing on her head a basket of roundedup bottles for which she insisted on being paid as she plumped them one at a time on the counter when as often happened madame refused to accept a bottle explaining that it had not come from her place the child flew into a tantrum flinging her thin arms and stamping her bare feet and screaming in soussou invariably the tantrum ran its futile course and she retired to a corner to nurse her unsalable bottles fondle her precious francs and sulk madame was as patient as a schoolmarm with difficult customers sometimes almost affectionately so there was a pair of winos who particularly drew her sympathy the men never seemed to work and yet they always had the price of some measure of a bottle of wine madame bantered amiably with them for as long as they were lucid and continued to indulge them when they no longer were the older man a moonfaced softeyed toma whoin his youth had traveled to serra leone and liberia spoke some english and offered to be my guide an offer he was in no condition to fulfill he never eats madame said of him rather like a fond but despairing mother he gets his only nourishment from wine the younger man a cocoacolored mulatto with wavy black hair and a face like a battered matinee idol affected imperious airs as a rule he spoke only to madame and when she was busy elsewhere talked to himself in a deeply modulated tone and in impeccable french toward evening the taverns limited space for customers swelled with workers having a quick beer on the way home or others already spruced up and out on the town it was a masculine assemblage but women occasionally infiltrated it a familiar female interloper was a tall silent soussou woman who appeared for a nightly beer with her baby laced to her back she never talked but stood apart at the wall and leisurely drank her beer there were however visits from less retiring ladies one of the least reticent was a middleaged north african woman a great partisan of wine who liked to regale prospective clients with tales of her sexual prowess her favorite fable involving no less a personage than the president of the republic he chose me she boasted brandishm ing her wine bottle at me and contorting her tattooed face in a yellowtoothed grimace intended to be seductive me the arab sekou toure came to my house i have proof i still have the thousandfranc note he gave me the proprietor usually arrived with the first surge of workers and leaving his helpers to unload the truck in front of the tavern joined madame behind the counter wet and soiled with sweat and grime he wore on these occasions a blue demin work shirt unbuttoned and khaki shorts over which his white belly hung and under which dropped gross legs unsightly with bluish lumps and varicose veins he scurried about between the counter and the refrigerator in the rear distributing cold beer collapsing winded on the counter during a lull in the rush of business he was in such an exhausted state gasping for breath but already launched in a denunciation of the moneygrasping americans when alioune came in relieved i welcomed the african with perhaps exaggerated warmth a warmth to which he was not receptive he seemed in fact more taciturn than before when his glance kept rising to my head i realized why you did not get a haircut msieur he said at length i have been very busy i said not altogether untruthfully alioune nodded knowingly when the frenchman went to fetch his beer he said why do you not go to the white mans barbershop you will like that better that is not necessarily true i said braking my annoyance at his smugness my hair is like yours and the african will know how to cut it however this reply did not get at the root of the tension i added you astonish me alioune what you have been told about american negroes is a lot of nonsense we do not prefer white people to africans we are anxious to know africans there simply has not been very much opportunity in the past alioune allowed himself a wry smile butfor the momentsaid nothing more when the frenchman returned with his beer he motioned toward the shelves above the untidy gray head the magazine he said the proprietor said ah as if anticipation of some imminent delight reached up andextracted a dogeared copy of a popular american weekly from a shelf he gave the magazine to alioune who placed it on the counter before me it had lain folded and he passed his hand over the creased slick paper so that it would lie flat the page to which the magazine was opened was soiled suggesting that it had been handed about print the text of a serial story covered most of the page and there was a column of advertisements on one side and a twocolumn cartoon at the bottom alioune pointed to the cartoon i looked down at the cartoon it showed a group of the thicklipped grassskirted spearwielding africans hovering hungrily about a large spot in which two pithhelmeted white man were being cooked my first impulse was to laugh for it was an amusing cartoon but the inclination toward levity was checked by my consciousness of aliounes seriousness and by the sudden awareness of the insidious influence at work on him when i looked up again aliounes eyes flared with accusation we are not savages msieur he said in a calm voice that only accentuated his smoldering fury my glance shifted along with my thoughts from alioune to the frenchman he was there leaning on the counter beaming over aliounes shoulder like some rolypoly mephisto after breakfast the following morning i hurried off to the barbershop while courage was fresh i had been invited by m debaste chief of the conakry base of fria the multimilliondollar international aluminum mining combine to dine in the firms eighthfloor penthouse that night several government ministers were to be on hand and i thought it appropriate to make my appearance as decent as possible a haircut would serve that purpose even if it made no contribution toward placating alioune on entering the shack i saw that the cloak of dust of two days before had not been disturbed and that fresh nap had been added to the hair rug on the floor the manager was busy and assuming there could not be so much difference i took the vacant chair on his left it was presided over by a thin ferretfaced young man as bafflingly neat and starched as the barbershop was disorderly and dusty the barber proceeded to chat as barbers will but i said very little preferring that he give all his attention to his work he snipped away rapidly enough perhaps a shade too rapidly and i several times cautioned him against taking off too much hair oui oui msieur je comprends he assured me each time and went on snipping with abandon when finally he presented me the fragmented mirror to view the finished job i was appalled my head looked as if a brood of angry hens had been scratching about in it is it as msieur wished the barber asked solicitously the scissors poised i quickly answered that it would have to do i thought it inadvisable to risk having him attempt to repair it for he might worsen it nature would fill in the gaps in the next few days the barber dusted by head and neck with talcum and i climbed out of the chair the manager regarded me with sympathy how much i asked merely as routine the barber hedged glanced undereyed at the manager and replied sotto voce cinq cents francs how much i demanded raising my voice it was incredible that he would ask five hundred francs for the mess he had made of my hair cinq cents francs he repeated in a more subdued voice than before i turned to the manager and asked very loudly what did you tell me the other day was the price of a haircut one hundred and fifty francs msieur he said apologetically i gave the scissor manipulator the correct fee and hurried off to the hotel to wash my head reflecting en route on the tenuousness of the bonds of brotherhood it was several days later when i next encountered alioune the dinner at fria and an interview with president toure already behind me the haircut had not failed to entertain m debaste and his guests and even the president i had rather looked forward to confronting alioune with the barbers attempt to swindle me thinking this might demonstrate that his own people were as capable of unfraternal attitudes as he imagined mine were but first i did a models whirl so that he could view the haircut fore and aft well i got my hair cut at your shop i said it is not very good alioune replied did the proprietor serve you no i said he was busy but the one who performed this job asked five hundred francs for it what do you think of that he showed no surprise did you pay it of course not then do not blame him you have more money than he does it is only logical that he ask what he thinks you will pay the frenchman who had been listening found the whole exchange hilarious he broke into uproarious laughter that was i suspected more affected than genuine ah you see you do not understand how they think we know the africans we live with them you are a white american in black skin aliounes cavernous eyes were fixed on my face he smiled slightly slyly as if in agreement with what the frenchman said the ghetto game by dennis clark ne of the most notable factors affecting the movement of negroes and other people of color in the urban centers has been the persistence of residential belts and islands of vs e ethnic groups in the older neighborhoods these concentrated ethnic groups have greatly influenced opinion and expectations about minorities historically the immigrant foreignlanguage groups established the american form of the ghetto pattern in the large cities their segregation was partly forced but partly voluntary permitting exit for those who were amenable to assimilation with the general population these ethnic enclaves with their traditionally inferior living conditions were the matrix for later and larger negro segregation areas when the great negro migration to the cities began around world war i the ethnic groups were a very considerable portion of the urban population in the foreignbom represented of our population as late as the central cities had very considerable percentages of foreignborn population the foreignborn in some of the major cities and the nonwhite populations with which they were in juxtaposition were foreign born nonwhite new york chicago los angeles philadelphia detroit boston the proximity of nonwhites and the foreignborn when it did not yield an uneasy tolerance produced confused resentment and hostility the happy fourth of july picture of hearty cocitizenship among all groups is misleading while a practical tolerance usually functions the attitudes and opinions underlying it are crude and well laced with antagonism although many immigrants have relaxed racial feelings others have for years replenished the ranks of the raceconscious immigrants from the old world were no doubt tutored in the fine points of racial distinction by the native americans those with foreignborn ties were usually no less susceptible to prejudice and racial antagonism than the nativeborn citizens of long standing their concentration in ethnic pockets gave ample social expression to their willingness to reject intrusion and adhere to group loyalties these groups became key factors in shaping the course of negro movement through urban residential areas in many places they rebuffed nonwhite entry into their areas or deflected it to other neighborhoods at times they formed walls of resistance to nonwhite movement or became swift evaders of nonwhite infiltration by moving away in concerted and disciplined fashion the ethnic communities of the large cities have constituted an obstacle course through which the nonwhites have had to move now displacing now surrounding now outflanking the immigrant islands and foreignlanguage concentrations obstacle course the primary consideration of the relationship of foreignlanguage communities to nonwhite population is that the immigrant neighborhoods have usually been physically contiguous or in opposition to nonwhite concentrations the negro and the foreignlanguage immigrant shared the limitations of income that forced them both to accept the older housing in the areas close to the center of the city for the negro this condition was more enduring he remained confined often while a succession of foreignborn groups came and went through the old neighborhoods this physical proximity is important it meant that the two types of minority groups racial and lingual were often in competition for the same shabby tenements and backstreet houses the foreignborn groups were often accustomed from their european background to working within circumscribed physical conditions their diligence and ingenuity would be lavished upon tiny areas that however poor they seemed by general american standards still represented relative comfort and security for the immigrant as the foreignbom groups thinned out they tended to shrink their concentrations or yield territory to others growing negro population often filled the abandoned irish italian or slavic areas but in order for the negro to gain access to the general channels of urban movement he frequently had to overcome or somehow bypass a traditionrooted core of immigrant residence these immigrant communities served as barriers against negro mobility for the rest of the city population examples of such roadblocks to negro movements could be seen in st louis around where germans jews poles and italians bordered the negro district west of the mississippi the polish principality of hamtramck in detroit has for years been impenetrable by negroes the ethnic ghettos along franklin street in north philadelphia have long prevented the eastward movement of negroes the physical confrontation of the negro and the white minority groups has been fraught with social factors that bedevilled the relationship the foreignborn were often not sure of themselves at all in their new urban environment many were unused to democracy and its concepts of social and racial equality upon achieving some status in this new country they felt they could not afford to have it undermined by mixing with the stigmatized nonwhite group although at times sensitive to discrimination themselves they were in too precarious a social position to let this permit a softening in their own attitude toward the nonwhites the foreignbom groups were beset with many internal conflicts and it was an easy response to direct hostility against the nonwhites the social conflicts and tensions accompanying the process of adjustment of the foreignbom to urban life tended to produce crime and delinquency which sometimes became a behavior pattern within the groups this turbulence became exceedingly dangerous when radical incidents took place to the tightly knit foreignbom groups the negro was often a strange and dreadful creature they would have less knowledge of him than even the native white american he would not be another european like the rest of the minorities he would not have the elaborate rituals and customs of the europeans but would seem to defy any cultural definition as a competitor for jobs space and facilities he was a threat it is evident then that among the group antagonisms in american cities the relationship between the negro and the foreignborn presented special difficulties but this is all in the past it was acted out in the early part of the century some would say this is too facile a judgment the foreignbom communities have been tenacious some have thrived for generations in addition to the foreignborn persons in these groups the second and thirdgeneration offspring are often strongly identified with ethnic ties the information that follows should be in no way construed as indicative of any thoroughgoing social malady in the groups discussed these groups all have remarkable qualities and have made remarkable contributions to american life their difficulties with the racial question though more severe or more immediate because of their physical proximity to negrooccupied areas are part of the more general vexation of our society on this issue we will look then at some of the groups whose position in the urban demographic pattern exposes them to the test of tolerance on race relations the poles people with race relations experienced contend that polish neighborhoods are particularly resistant to racial change and are likely to react violently to incursions by nonwhites areas of polish immigrant or other slavic concentration have been the scenes of some of the most notable outbursts ot racial violence in northern cities violence in detroit is often ascribed to polish elements as were outbreaks in cicero illinois adjacent to chicago the poles are noted as a highly individualistic people a people caught in historic contradictions the history of the mother country may be very significant in explaining the polish attitude toward group relationships in this country polands shifting borders and political life have embraced a number of traditionally hostile ethnic and nationality groups within poland there have been in modern times a variety of populations coexisting in uneasy polity lithuanians estonians germanspeaking elements ukrainians white russians jews and various balkan strains have lived in polish territory intermittently the poles have had a difficult time to look at it from their viewpoint with a long historical succession of fiery separatist unyielding foreignlanguage and ethnic minorities this accounts for some of the furious quality of polish nationalism with such a legacy of intergroup difficulty it is not surprising that poles did not come to the polyglot american city with a bland attitude toward minority neighbors in the new world in the great monument of research on the poles the polish peasant in europe and america thomas and znaniecki point out a distinctive feature of polish immigrant life they note that the poles formed their mutual aid societies and social and fraternal groups before they concentrated residentially this is important it means that there was an especially deliberate character to polish residential concentration it did not take place in such a random fashion as that of other groups while it was no doubt subject to the general exigencies of immigrant settlement there was more consultation direction and group influence in the choices that formed the polish communities thus the polish neighborhood is less of an accident and more of a group bastion than the neighborhoods of most other immigrants moreover polish families usually devote a great deal of energy and thrift to the care of dwellings the house is a family project and all share in its improvement in such areas as detroits hamtramck which has stood as an allwhite area adjacent to negro concentrations for years the steady improvement of the housing is a tribute to the hard work of immigrant families the reaction of such families to the encroachment of negroes whose residential history has been one of privation is strongly resentful the rough caliber of this resentment is described by one commentator on big city life the poles who for the most part live in neighborhoods that have not yet been entered by negro families are said to be determined to resist with violence if necessary any negro invasion of the areas they inhabit political committeemen in polish neighborhoods have vocally associated themselves with this attitude as a minority group the poles have not fared as well in the american immigrant sweepstakes as others bogue points that the secondgeneration poles in the united states have actually a lower socioeconomic status than the first generation poles have also remained in a position near the bottom of the social distance scale a device drawn up by social scientists to reflect prevalent ethnic preferences in terms of educational attainment the poles rank low among immigrant groups in this country the jews and irish do well in increasing the level of school years completed between first and second generation italians and others complete fewer years in school these factors would certainly have an influence upon the race relations of the group deprivation of social status would heighten the likelihood that poles would feel a need for a scapegoat the negro would be present and often in a position to compete with the pole for jobs and other opportunities the lower educational achievement of the pole would increase the possibility of unthinking and pugnacious responses to racial change because the percentage of polishborn persons in the population will decrease rapidly in coming years and because residential mobility will continue to erode the old polishoccupied neighborhoods the acuteness of the racial problem with respect to this group is likely to diminish since the poles are a predominantly roman catholic group the gradual but pervasive catholic moral concern for the elimination of racial inequities will have an affect as the educational level of people of polish background rises the italians of all immigrant groups the italians are most symbolic for the twentieth century of the great american experience of immigration of the major immigration groups they were the last great wave to arrive from europe in the tens of thousands their arrival was the denouement of the tremendous atlantic migration they seemed to enact the drama of building an urban ethnic world in american cities with a zestful enthusiasm numerically the italianborn are our largest foreignborn group their concentrations in the little italys in the various cities are still very much with us the italian neighborhoods are some of our most striking examples of ethnic aggregation today if we omit negro neighborhoods from consideration the italian neighborhoods with their accompanying churches fraternal lodges italian food shops and gregarious family life have not been confined to older largecity areas many smaller industrial towns in the east fruitgrowing areas on the west coast and foodprocessing centers have strong italian communities we are most concerned however with the italianoccupied areas adjoining negro districts these older neighborhoods usually derived their italian character from the first waves of immigration from southern italy beginning in the s and reaching its height in the early years of this century the tide ebbed after world war i the exhaustion of the sicilian sulphur mines the demise of feudal estates with political change the great disaster of the blight of the grapevines and the hope for a better life in america brought tens of thousands of italians to our urban areas at times the immigrants were recruited for american industry by agents in italy employment was found in railroad construction the garment trades the building trades and food industries one striking feature of the italian residential blocks has been the housing improvements that have taken place under private initiative the extensive engagement of italians in building trades meant that the families usually had valuable skills available the men could cut stone lay brick and cement and do a great number of things by way of physical improvement of homes and shops and significantly they could do these things themselves well enough to be proud of the results owing to the association of negroes with shabby and deteriorated houses the financial and emotional investment of the italian householder was felt to be in jeopardy when negroes encroached also the italian neighborhood has been steadily replenished by secondand thirdgeneration offspring strong family ties induce a number of the younger families to stay within walking distance of parents and grand parents the beloved nona the winemaking grandfather the generous uncle or godparent are just too wellaccepted and compatible to desert large families in small houses mean that the young will seek the outdoors in cities this means the street comer or some familiar sandwich shop in the italian neighborhoods the pizza shops and the soda fountain hangouts are the scenes for second and thirdgeneration streetcorner society it is in the relations of juvenile groups that antagonism between negroes and white immigrant groups often flares up the case of italian youths will be cited here not because it is peculiar to them but because there are good examples of friction in italian neighborhoods in the case files of interracial and intergroup relations agencies a further complication to the racial issue may be a latin concept of personal honor which requires an injury to be avenged this would increase the possibility of hostile exchange in and early two cities provided examples of incidents involving italians and negroes the incidents were largely independent of one another but their combined impact on the respective italian and negro groups should be considered carefully because the outbreaks formed a clear sequence in popular opinion in philadelphia in may a high school boy john campigla was killed by a wolf pack attack of negro youths the killing was utterly senseless and the victim utterly innocent public opinion in the italian community was inflamed a series of small fights and a retaliatory shotgun attack took place shortly afterward in the same section of the city fortunately the shotgun blast only slightly injured a negro girl on the steps of a baptist church in june a young policeman named marinelli was called to a melee in a heavily negro area of north philadelphia he leaned from the door of his patrol wagon and fired his gun repeatedly at a fleeing man he killed not only the man but a woman near him both victims were negro both were innocent of any offense negro community opinion was outraged in february while the trial of the killers of john campiglia was in progress the son of a civic leader in south philadelphia named ianelli was beaten by a teenage gang of negroes the boys father had been a worker for better race relations in march a teenager named cerone was stabbed by negro boys after a basketball game the wound resulting in paralysis in the same month an emotionally disturbed italian warbride wife of a negro in an integrated community attracted public notice by placing antinegro signs around her home and engaging in other antinegro activity these incidents with the publicity attending them formed a pattern for the italian and negro groups their effect was to add fuel to smoldering hostility and to start a chainreaction of aggravating incidents which heightened the possibility of a general outbreak these incidents are typical of the violence that plagues the relationship between ethnic groups the events are usually given sensationalized coverage in the general press as well as being reported in the italian and spanishlanguage papers and the negro press people conscious of ethnic identity take sides connecting the incidents with a special kind of rivalry the chance of retaliation is increased by the proximity of the groups such series of events are common in the large cities the hostility thus generated may come to a head at any time to provide the tinder form thus generated may come to a head at any time to provide the tinder for largescale racial violence fortunately for blessed but obscure reasons it seldom does the jews jewish people are wise in the ways of cities they have for centuries been an urban people time after time they have seen racial antagonism mount in city streets it is improbable however that they have ever encountered on such a large scale the kind of problem presented by the urbanization of the american negro the entire social life of the modern city is momentously different from that of the past in the past population movement was slow today there is swift movement resulting in an almost random mixture of people from various backgrounds in metropolitan centers in this setting the large jewish populations of the major northern cities are involved in a very distinctive way in the nations struggle to resolve the american dilemma of race relations one of the places in which negroes confront jews is the corner store in many of the great segregated districts the last outposts of white residence are the groceries small drygoods stores and pharmacies which are in many cases owned and operated as family businesses by modestly prosperous jewish people because of their economic stake in these small businesses the owners have frequently been reluctant to leave areas which have changed racially in segregated neighborhoods where the earning power and standard of living are often depressed these little stores fit intimately into neighborhood life they are flexible enough to meet the irregular needs of informal local and family living in overcrowded negro districts the streetcorner society which affords an outlet to the young centers around such small businesses m in these circumstances the jewish storekeeper is often the only white man many negroes see on a regular basis he is a person who gives service but often he is also a family creditor to whom the grocery bill is owed the amount of antisemitism that may grow out of this latter relationship is surprising as the last white resident on the block in sections where existence is less than genteel it is understandable that small shopkeepers should at times feel the pressure of minoritygroup frustration and counterprejudice a second sphere of influence in which negroes and jews interact is in those heavily jewish neighborhoods that have begun to change racially the sequence of migrations of minority groups through our cities has often placed negroes next in line to jews in social status and homebuying ability neighborhoods once forbidden to jews have received substantial influxes of jewish home owners because of geographical convenience or economic accessibility these same neighborhoods are now attractive to nonwhite home buyers the aspiring negro sees in these areas the same virtues of middleclass respectability that jewish families fresh from the immigrant jewtowns saw in them a generation ago perhaps there is also some basis for supposing that the liberal opinion prominent in bigcity jewish circles and the traditionally nonviolent disposition of jews exert an attraction on negroes seeking a way out of segregated neighborhoods in neighborhoods where jews form a very substantial portion of the poulation there has been no marked deviation from the general pattern of response to negro newcomers essentially the white reaction remains the same the likelihood of violence is at a minimum but the development of panic and gradual white withdrawal is the usual course community leadership sympathetic toward racial integration does seem to be more frequent in such areas but this does not change the eventual outcome the promotion of interracial understanding still comes too little and too late to be of any practical significance there are other influences that seem to make neighborhoods with heavy jewish populations susceptible to racial turnover for many jewish families long in the urban tradition the processes of property exchange contain no mystery they enter without hesitation into real estate transactions when the question arises of leaving a changing neighborhood in addition in a group keenly preoccupied with education the coming of negroes to the public school seems in the light of racial stereotypes like a blow to the educational advantages and prospects of jewish children other factors permitting greater mobility are the small size of jewish families and the relatively high proportion of jews who live in apartments instead of owning houses in any event the middleclass status of the bulk of the jewish population usually assures some assets with which to negotiate a property sale the problem of a synagogue in a racially changing area should also be noted unlike many christian denominations the jews do not proselytize the synagogue congregation can not absorb incoming negro families the way a correctly oriented roman catholic or a congregational or methodist church can and reduction in the congregation due to the removal of a jewish family is likely to be permanent if a sufficient proportion of the congregation migrates it may be economically mandatory for the temple to follow this is one reason for the growth of the echo ghetto in the suburbs the old downtown congregation reforms in the new area the third sphere in which negroes and jews are particularly linked is not so much physical as it is one of social psychology the negro and jew are both members of a minority group that experienced a sour tolerance or actual illtreatment on the american scene this fact has brought forth a sort of kinship or practical affinity between jews and negroes based on their common concern for fair treatment and democratic rights hence jewish and negro organizations can usually be found working together for civil_rights fair employment intergroup understanding and racial integration many jewish groups devote more effort to bettering race relations than to any other object the american jew shares actively in the economic abundance that has been the nations harvest for the last fifteen years he walks with nonjews as leader organization man and laborer in the economic activities of the day he inhabits suburbia and plays a vigorous role both as producer and consumer the negro by contrast is just beginning to emerge from an economic limbo his family income job status savings and property ownership are all below the national average for whites and nobody really knows how much of the recent progress of negroes in these areas has been achieved at the expense of such sacrifices as the employment of mothers and the postponement of medical and educational needs in social organization we perceive once again a great disparity between jew and negro jews have an enviable apparatus of fraternal charitable and civic organizations manned by articulate and effective leaders negroes are still suffering from the paucity of leadership that has been a traditional characteristic of depressed ethnic groups arriving on the urban scene men like martin_luther_king are exceptional in any group the ability of a group to train and consistently present skilled leadership is slowgrowing leadership in effective force does not rise out of a vacuum it must have preconditions of education organized tradition a degree of leisure and concourse with the elites of power and learning an examination of the relationship between the negro and the jew in the light of the social factors mentioned above indicates that there is a considerable social gap between the two groups in spite of the bond of sympathy they share one of the practical effects of this situation is that jews are often placed under extreme pressures when they face up to racial issues often jewish people solidly supporting liberal race relations practices and programs feel genuinely repelled by the social differences persisting in the negro population when racial integration confronts them and they are brought face to face with the contrasts between the great bulk of the newly urbanized negro population and their own established middle class thus jews do seem to have a special problem with respect to racial change puerto ricans although puerto rican migration to the mainland has not brought about a great dispersion of spanishspeaking people generally through the eastern cities it has resulted in strong puertorican concentrations in the old neighborhoods of philadelphia chicago bridgeport and above all new york the influx has thus placed the puerto ricans in some of the major urban centers which are today vast laboratories of social tension and racial change placed beside american negroes or intermingled with them the puerto ricans have been very confused in their racial attitudes their hispanic background has endowed them with a rather casual attitude toward race this attitude is subtle in the mainland cities the keen consciousness of race among the general population forces puerto ricans to question their own tradition in racial matters and frequently to adopt a more decisive attitude towards racial differences in response to the mainland abberrations but this is done with much inner confusion racial distinctions in puerto rico are mild but they are there the spanish terms of el bianco white el indio dark skin with straight hair el grijo white coloring but with hair or features of a negroid cast el bien triguena a fairer negro and the use of the term el negro as a word of opprobrium reflect the differing values ascribed to racial visibility on the island within the puerto rican group however particularly in puerto rico color is inconsequential in social relations in families there will sometimes be a subtle feeling of status difference based on color between siblings but this is seldom serious on the mainland this attitude of casual acceptance can suddenly become starkly challenged and the emotional impact on family life and personal awareness can be tremendous the acute ingroup feeling and loyalty in the puerto rican communities induces the hispanos to reject the american negro on double grounds first as an outsider and second as a symbol of and a target for racial discrimination with which it would be unwise to be identified the spanishspeaking puerto rican of dark color is fraternally treated except perhaps on the mainland where there is question of intimate or permanent relationshipsbut the american negro is an interloper a threat a puzzle the fact that similar disabilities afflict both groups in many ways only heightens the puerto ricans resentment against the american negro thus puerto ricans may resent appeals against prejudice and discrimination which link american negroes and hispanos puerto ricans in new york and elsewhere have been harbingers of racial change in east harlem the bronx and brooklyn they have preceded negro entries having the puerto ricans in the role of precursors has not noticeably slowed the classic white response of withdrawal upon negro influx in the mainland cities the relations between american negroes and puerto ricans have commonly been strained with juvenile fights the most frequent expression of this antagonism the tension seems greatest with respect to newly arrived puerto ricans there is some moderation of hostility as the groups reside in the same area over a period of time small groups will become friends and establish ties casually in the second or third generation but the barrier to intimate association will usually remain there is the old area competition between the two groups for jobs and housing the negro resents the arrival of the puerto rican to work for lower pay puerto ricans who open small shops and stores accuse negroes of being stupid or lazy because they have in the main been slow to build such businesses any advances made by hispanos are subject to criticism by negroes because the puerto rican not born on the mainland and speaking a foreign language is successful at the expense of negroes while hispanos and negroes may resent one another their residential association is constantly enforced the puerto ricans are recently arrived in the cities and so are many southern negroes landlords are seldom capable of according the groups separate status although the language factor may make property rental more difficult for the hispanos the distinction and separation is made at the insistence of the puerto ricans who tend to choose dwellings removed from negro occupancy so far as this is possible in areas crowded by the adjacent groups perhaps the chief factor separating the two groups besides the consciousness of color is a difference in attitudes about sex and the family at the neighborhood level this is extremely important for the residential world is a domestic one the hispano family is extended proud and has a careful code of behavior and relationships prescribed by long tradition the negro family is nuclear weakened by many longterm influences and informal in its relationships in the puerto rican family the male has high status in the negro family the woman has so often been breadwinner that she is the main figure puerto ricans resent the easy approach to women that mainland negroes may exhibit for puerto ricans the woman is guarded by a protective supervision of attitudes and customs hence there is a subtle strategy of withdrawal among the spanishspeaking families which evades advances by american negroes even though life may be proceeding on a friendly basis the negro who may have encountered promiscuous contacts between puerto rican males and american negro women sees no reason why the compliment shouldnt be returned by puerto rican women especially since many may be just as dark as he is there are other divergences in churches and in recreation some commentators state that integration of the mainland negroes and puerto ricans is far away the two groups will continue to share the worst of the housing supply with the puerto rican frequently unable to escape identification with the negro although residential segregation of necessity will operate less precisely in the case of some spanishspeaking because they are not readily identifiable as colored the puerto rican will continue to be the alter ego of the mainland negro in residential matters the negro neighborhoods adjoining the white minority communities have an ambiguous set of attitudes toward their distant neighbors on the one hand the immigrants are subject to some discrimination as is the negro in some ways relationships may be casual and unprejudiced negroes may shop in the curbside italian markets or go to school with puerto ricans or realize that jewish organizations are prointegration on the other hand there will be a recognition that the immigrants do constitute a group by themselves with their own exclusive clubs and programs and the negro will know that acquiring a house in the immigrant area will mean trouble for the negro population the significance of the white immigrant as a member of a minority group tends to be obscured by the simple fact that the immigrant is white thereby sharing the negative characteristics of the stereotyped white person so common in the thinking of negroes it is frequently observed by native negroes with some bitterness that they are denied opportunities which the foreignborn can easily obtain the resettlement of hungarian refugees after the disorders in that country in aroused resentment in negro circles as they saw it persons who had made no contribution to this country were fussed over by the government and resettled in good houses in good neighborhoods negroes couldnt occupy those same houses without bringing the scorching wrath of their fellow citizens down on their heads on succeeding some immigrant population in an area negroes often find that the housing is owned by a number of absentee landlords of the previous immigrant group the negro families may face rent gouging and other forms of exploitation and their attitude toward the group represented by the landlords may become hostile the activities of immigrant savings and loan societies which control property or immigrant fraternal groups who purchase property to keep it out of the hands of negroes produce the same kind of negative reaction the muslim and black nationalist groups which have been widely publicized in recent years are not averse to singling out jews and other groups for special indictment in race relations these negro extremist cults do not represent any large segment of negro opinion but their arguments in this matter will usually be listened to with care by a great number of negroes who may be familiar with the racial thinking of white ethnic groups as the inquirer proceeds to the more educated levels of negro life however he finds that the commitment of negroes to tolerance and interracial fellowship offsets bad experiences the informed and intelligent negro seldoms singles out particular white ethnic groups for criticism in racial matters but tends to argue in terms of the white population as a whole native whites although we have concentrated our attention upon foreignborn groups in this chapter it should not be inferred that cohesive nativeborn neighborhoods are not a frequent source of trouble the problems arising from neighborhoods with a high percentage of appalachian mountaineers have been of considerable concern in some cities cities with a high homeownership rate where neighborhoods are stable and the population relatively settled produce the phenomenon of entrenched burghers with practically no immigrant ties who yet vigorously oppose racial change such areas are not nearly so troublesome as immigrant locales but they indicate that it is not so much immigrant peculiarities as the fundamental sense of group cohesion which threatens social harmony in racial situations the population elements deriving from the old immigration of the early nineteenth century have of course been deeply enmeshed in the traditions of racial exclusion and restriction whatever our estimate of the reactions of new immigrant groups we must not forget that these groups have been entering into an american stream of social opinion in which racism was a strong current the upperclass and middleclass neighborhoods of the succesful old immigration elements were the models for the newer arrivals there are forces at work in nativeborn neighborhoods that on occasion can produce agitated waves of racial feeling although such areas seldom hold the same violence potential as immigrant communities the insecurity of the junior executive suburb is an example in a suburb of organization man families the corporations that control the jobs of the breadwinners may transfer a household head to another city on short notice hence the home owners are extremely sensitive to anything which would make the selling of their houses more difficult the presence of negroes in the area is such a factor this junior executive difficulty was thought to be one of the reasons why the suburban town of deerfield illinois reacted with hostility to a plan to erect a limited number of attractive homes for interracial occupancy nearby another reaction in nativeborn old immigration areas in recent years has been the product of a decline into minority status on the part of formerly predominant groups oldline white protestant communities in large cities where the populations are increasingly catholic and negro are beginning to display all marks of minority psychology they feel hemmed in discriminated against objects of the illwill of the growing negro and catholic elements security and selfpossessed assurance are beginning to wane under the impact of metropolitan population mobility and changes in the urban power structure even though many of the oldline neighborhoods and suburbs are not yet confronted with racial change they have had to admit jews italians and a variety of other formerly proscribed groups having been nudged this far the oldline residents have begun to fear that the next step racial change is inevitable this is a reaction that is not found among the hardier new immigrants who are often ready to contest each street in their area the shifting population of the urban centers will alter the residential makeup in the central city areas only vestiges of the immigrant communities will remain for some years yet however these communities will have a special significance for race relations in most of the larger cities the municipal intergroup relations agencies have representation from the different ethnic groups on their boards or in staffs this at least permits some communication with the groups so that when conflict situations or severe tensions arise there can be consultation and the exertion of accepted leadership to avoid outbreaks or the continuation of hostility formal representation of ethnic groups on those civic bodies committed to peace and fair play increases the possibility that mutual respect will be maintained the leadership of each group is loath to be stigmatized as irresponsible or incendiary in the eyes of the other group such a formula for civic peace in the diversified urban community can be effective if it is well administered and serviced with an adequate program of information conference and involvement of representative opinion leaders but if the formula is mere windowdressing a coalition of ethnic leaders for mutual admiration and egogratification or for the sake of political display then the city that permits such a fraud may find its peace broken and its minority group relations poisoned by antagonism the day of immigrant neighborhoods may be fading fast but these areas have had a strategic significance in the last two decades in their effect upon nonwhite urban movement they represent a notable interlude in intergroup relations the lessons we can learn from them should not be readily forgotten
a challenge to negro leaders by louis e lomax ime settles all disputes thus the social critics are separated from the vested interest leaders truth is separated from organizational propaganda in mid i published in harpers magazine an article the negro revolt against the negro leadership class that article led to my current book the negro revolt which is now in its fifth printing and also issued in paperback the thesis of both the article and the book is that as of the montgomery bus boycott the american negro has been in a state of revolt that the revolt is not only against segregation but against the entrenched negro leadership class as well my specific point was that legalism had taken the negro about as far as it could that from this point forward the negro would fight his main battles in the streets and in the market place i agreed with the militant students core and dr martin_luther_king that the law was clear that what was needed was for negroes to present their bodies as living sacrifices to implement the already stated court decisions as a necessary consequence of this position i was critical of those negro organizations specifically the naacpthat refused to make a clearcut committment to whatever kinds of demonstration were necessary to actualize the rights the courts have long since said we have for this i was drawn and quartered by certain national leaders i have in my files proof that one negro organization tried to stop certain publications from employing me i have letters from local naacp branch presidents saying they had been advised by the naacp national office that i was not to be allowed to speak before naacp meetings white liberal columnistsnotably harry golden and lawrence spevackcalled me an extremist and suggested that i smelled of malcolm_x in some instances the attack on me approached calumny the crisis article the revolt of louis e lomax reprinted in negro digest december was so invidious that i felt deep sorrow for the excellent and brilliant mind that had been given such an assignment but time settles all disputes and i held my rebuttal in the certain knowledge that moving events would speak for me or against me with my critics or against them and time spoke with a thunderclap at birmingham alabama i was there i ran with hundreds of negro children as they like jack rabbitsscampered from churches past fire hoses over policemen and by growling dogs into the center of birmingham where they staged one mighty rockandroll for freedom and dignity and when the tumult was done birmingham department stores had pledged themselves to desegregation of their facilities to upgrading of negro employees to the release of negro demonstrators and a biracial committee had been formed to watch over continuing racial progress in that tormented town reporting from birmingham time magazine said birminghams negroes were not worried about legalities they were not worried about the niceties of timing instead theirs was a raging desire to achieve equal human status now and by whatever means as any liberal well knows when time comes upon such a discovery the fact is at least three years old and it was edward brooke the attorney general of massachusetts and its first statewide negro official who underscored the point said brooke the pressure is mounting it has been smoldering for many years and it is a justifiable impatience birmingham is but the beginning the continuation actuallyfor at this writing nashville memphis chicago and albany georgia are belching racial flames demonstrators have already taken to the streets and the market places of these towns in allout efforts to gain what they deem to be their just freedoms philadelphians led on by core have just staged an all night sitin at city hall as a result the mayor has signed an order that will stop all city building until the unions involved hire and upgrade negroes so then the story goes but this is no hour for gloating as ambassador carl rowanthen a minnesota newsmansaid lomaxs the revolt against the negro leadership class raises the question that will plague leadership for the next decade or so and it is with this issue not for personalities involved that i wish to deal first of all the bickering among negro leaders and leadership organizations has reached such proportions that it could hamper racial progress the classic evidence of this is the story surrounding the birth of the voter education program that is now doing such magnificent work in the deep south while i was working on the tv documentary walk in my shoes i was given a news tip according to the tipster some quarter of a million dollars was available to underwrite a concentrated negro voter registration drive in the deep south provided the various negro leadership organizations could pull together and carry out the program each in its own way but with an umbrella of central guidance i checked out the story found it to be true and was able to isolate the taconic foundation as the fountain of funds i did not break the story my agent had a ready market for it because those in the know felt that a premature break of the story would endanger the entire project for the better part of two months i kept the story quiet but managed to stay abreast of developments things moved slowly but eventually i received irrefutable information that every negro leadership organization but the naacp had agreed to participate in the program from inside the naacp national board itself i received information that the program was in grave trouble there that the board had just decided to defer voting on the project until a future board meeting this is the way we handle hot potatoes the board member told me we never turn them down and open ourselves to criticism we simply keep setting them over to another meeting at about the same time i discovered that the holders of the purse strings were getting nervous they had about decided to withdraw the money if the naacp did not agree to work with the project after all a spokesman said to me we cant afford to launch such a drive without the cooperation of the largest best organized and best known negro leadership organization on the day this information fell into place i was scheduled to make a broadcast on radio station wbai in new york it was a freewheeling type program that allowed me fifteen minutes to say whatever i chose i elected to break the story as i have related it here i omitted the name of the organization that had so far refused to work with the voter project i concluded by asking whether a negro leadership organization had the moral right to refuse participation in such a program without a public explanation the result was electric innocent organizationsspecifically core were bombarded by memberdonors who demanded to know how such a large sum of money could be lost when theythe organizationswere constantly begging for funds the organizations replied we are not the guilty ones the mystery of the guilty organization was solved by the naacp itself whena few days laterit sent an emergency memorandum to all its branches in the new york area the memorandum castigated me for being an inaccurate sensationseeking reporter and then went on to say why the naacp had not agreed to the voter registration project witnm hours after that memo the naacp agreed to the project and the now famous voter education program was underway what was behind all this the naacp feltand rightly sothat it had been doing a good voter registration job in the south the power structure had qualms about joining a broad program where the naacp efforts would become less distinctive and identifiable from an organizational point of view the naacp leadership was absolutely correct joining the voter education program would certainly blur the specific contributions made by that organization from a negro point of view the naacp leadership was absolutely wrong for the purpose of the naacpor of all negro leadership organizations for that matteris not to perpetuate the organization but to free negroes from second class citizenship and when the bickering over who will get the credit and thus have a larger base for fund raising begins to cloud the sky of freedom then it is time that a warning be sounded secondly negro leadership is so sensitive to social criticism that it has resorted to tactics that border on censorship item in i was the associate producer of the awardwinning tv documentary walk in my shoes which was seen on the abc network several days before the show was aired abc officials received a letter from an naacp official on naacp stationery objecting to the airing of the program abc officials were astounded because we didnt know just how the documentary would shape up ourselves at that moment we were still in the final stages of editing and cutting abc contacted the official and asked how he could object to that which he had not seen that which we ourselves had not settled on he replied in essence that it didnt make any difference what was in the documentary as long as lomax has anything to do with it we object i hasten to add that the official involved was a national official but no one was more shocked than roy wilkins when he was apprised as to what one of his underlings had done item a similar situation occurred when i wrote the bitter cup a dramatic show that was seen on nbcs frontier of faith the naacp got wind of it demanded a screening got it and literally frightened network officials into making last minute changes item mrs tina sattin wife of singer lonnie sattin and program chairman of the mount vernon new york naacp branch called and asked me to speak for their membership rally on the morning of the rally mrs sattin called and with deep apology she had just the week before helped me with a telethon during which upwards of were raised for the freedom riders told me that gloster current naacp secretary for branches had issued an order that i not speak several hours of telephone wrangling ensued and the branch president mrs gerry johnson decided that i should speak anyway i addressed the rallyall of those present item during a recent lecture tour of california a white member of the santa monica naacp at tended one of my lectures she asked me if i would come to her branch and help them raise money and members both of which they desperately needed despite a clause in my lecture agency contract which forbids me to make unscheduled free lectures i agreed to come a few days later i received a letter from the embarrassed white liberal the lecture was off the naacp national office had advised that i was not to speak i have kept these items personal for a reason i can defend and prove each of them if challenged to do so but i am by no means the only one on the naacps list my sin is that i feel the naacp should become directly involved in direct action as a member andthenexecutive board person this was certainly my right what better place for a debate concerning naacp policy than naacp meetings themselves or is the pursuit of civil_rights impervious to free speech thirdly negro leadership attacks upon those who engage in honest open social criticism has begun to embrace pure meanness dr john morsells article the revolt of louis e lomax is the ultimate evidence of this item dr morsell blames me for misspelling a name and the inconsistency of certain dates mentioned in my book the negro revolt now i write books i dont edit proofread or publish them the job of correcting misspellings and making sure dates are correct is that of the proofreader and copy editor dr morsell should know this if he doesnt he is too stupid to lead anybody anywhere if he knows it and still made such charges he is a disgrace to his job and our people as well item dr morsell refers to me as a selfasserted naacp board member who that either i am a member of my naacp board or i am not if i am notand the books are certainly available to dr morsell roy wilkins top aid then i should be exposed for making such a dastardly public claim if i amand no one knows better than dr morsell that i was a board member at the time the book was writtenthen why call me a selfasserted member this was of course pure meanness an unvarnished attempt to smear my image as a local naacp official who dared speak out against the policy of the national office item dr morsell writes that i have managed to master the ageold negro art of fooling white people this from a top naacp official and a man of dr morsells mind at that is all but incredible as the executive director of a major foundation remarked to me they the naacp must be pretty frightened to write something like that but if the aim of this attack on me was to frighten off further criticism the naacp has all but succeeded i doubt that another negro writer will soon write criticism of the naacp even though to a man they agree much more should be both written and said finally negro leadership with the exception of james farmer of core has about lapsed into moderation on the race issue the distinction between the militants and the moderates is now rather easy to define the militants hold that there should be demonstrations calculated to paralyze the economic and political structure of a town until that towns fathers give us the freedoms the courts have certified the moderates favor additional legal wrangling or at best token demonstrations and this is the very issue between the naacp national leadership and me dr morsell makes much of the fact that the naacp staged sitins years ago he couldnt be more right i say as much in my book what he doesnt explain is why they stopped staging them had the naacp kept the sitins going the student sitin of and the freedom rides of wouldnt have been necessary and even while dr morsell was castigating me by saying the naacp had a long history of direct action dr stephen gill spottswood national board president of the naacp was calling the student demonstrations signal flares and roy wilkins was predicting that the funds for such forays would soon dry up if one is schizoid he can probably be both peter and paul but ill be damned if he can be both christian and pagan and this with respect to direct action is precisely what naacp national leadership is trying to do at dead center of all this as i point out in my book is the burning need for negro leadership to meet at the summit and parcel out areas of action and responsibility core martin_luther_king and the student non violent coordinating committee are experienced mass demonstrators let them march into the streets and the market place and the rest of us should either march behind them or send them money to buy marching shoes and the first national negro leader who throws stoneshard or soft should be unfrocked the naacp legal defense and education fund is the nations top civil_rights law firm and it is ours it belongs to us jack greenbergs job is to get us out of jail and fight our case when we demonstrate for our rights let jack greenberg do it and the rest of us should give him a hand when it comes to raising the funds to carry on this being true why is it necessary for the naacp to maintain its own legal division although the naacp legal defense and education fund is a separate entity roy wilkins insists that it and the naacp are under the same umbrella fine but if true just what is robert carters job and why is attorney carter beating the bushes for money to increase his legal office to a a year operation the naacp is without question one of the best of the lobbies its contacts with big white people in high places cannot be duplicated here is an important role after all the naacp does talk to the establishment and to be sure the establishment runs this republic there is enough prejudice to go around negroes dont have to squabble over the right to grapple with mean white people there are enough of them to keep all of us busy for the next twentyfive years what we must do is unify decide who will hit where and with what weapons this done the rest of us like good little indians should fall in line we are on our way no one desires to displace our present leaders we do ask that they lead us rather than follow white moderation come what may we are on our way if our leaders wont go then dont hinder us for we are on our waythank godto freedom land have negro ministers failed their roles by dr nathan hare may come as a suri v prise to many persons r to see negro clergy men analyzed as if they were merely human beings past practice has been to let them hide behind a pious shield of infallibility which while protecting them from public rebuke shut out the advantages of kind and impartial appraisal it is no secret however that they are talked about like wenches by their membersbehind their backs in a manner which cannot help them because it is kept a secret from them my own decision to offer the clergy the charity of my frank and unexpurgated observations came only after my sympathy for them was aroused by the sorrowful manner in which they have begun to cry out in distress c eric lincoln for example a methodist minister and an expert on the black muslims in america has bemoaned the efficiency of malcolm_xs contingency for stealing protestant ministers and other religious bigwigs reporting that as many as per cent of a typical muslim congregation is exchristian the rev james f campbell for another while pointing out that statistics show more churchgoers in america than ever before reports a drastic decline in negro attendance see what happened to the negros religion negro digest april the rev mr campbell sadly conceded that todays negro would just as soon go bowling but he concluded that it is simply a hard thing to figure out and chastized negroes for their fleeting piety i submit that ministers err in blaming it all on backsliding converts and elijah muhammed and father divine and so although i am not prepared to serve as a diplomat between ministers and their members i should like to give them the benefit if i may of the humble insights to follow assuming that if they know the truth then the truth shall set them free the passing of the shepherdpastor to understand the trend of waning negro piety we must look for the answer first in the changing society as it affects negro churchlife there is for one thing the special extent to which the negro has experienced the sudden transition from the close intimate familiarity of farm folk to the cold impersonality of metropolitan life and what that has done to the relations between minister and member the close friendship of the oldtime pastor of farm and small town life tor example has not been generated by the amicable strangers now elected to pastorates on the basis of their divinity degrees and formal credentials whereas the pastors life once bloomed side by side with his flocks both in and out of the church the cityward trek of the negro has brought him to the mass church and the sunday preacher who is seldom if ever seen closeup by the majority of his members this does not exclude the occasional postsermon handshake administered by him or one of his assistant pastors as members mechanically file from the church building this separation of minister and follower has made it ever less likely that the ends of the minister and those of the members will be of one accord quite frequently in fact the members find themselves pursuing salvation while their pastors pant after power and glory in general the shepherdpastor has been replaced by the administratorexecutive who even resents being called preacher and pompously demands the title minister thusly bent on officialdom he is consumed by a passion for presiding as an end in itself the passion for presiding the passion for presiding fed no doubt by a longing to master leads to an eternal turmoil of petty resentments a number of washington d c ministers recently were salty because a chicago minister rather than a local clergyman was chosen by the white chairman of an emancipation exercise to give the closing benediction similarly because the ministers chances of presiding are greater the higher his status they must constantly contend for position and official recognition this is due partly again to the factor of urbanization in the anonymity of the metropolis no longer is the ministers status wellknown and unchallenged throughout the community the resulting competition for renown impells him perennially to publicize his prestige in the struggle for conspicuous repute the consequences of this condition are now wellknown many persons have been appalled over and over again by the necessity for switching from the churchhouse to the courthouse and back again on the part of our major denominations in order to have disputes arising from power struggles among black men of the cloth settled by white judges thus although some still tell their flocks to take their troubles to the lord and leave them there they suggest by example that our troubles should be taken to the white power structure the reputation for this among negro baptist ministers whose policy appears to be to do unto others before they do unto you is even greater than that of our negro methodists when the baptist group flocked to kansas city for the event the mayor met them with warm words of welcome saying in effect according to the chicago crusader welcomebut go home if you came here to raise hell well these spiritual leaders including some wellknown advocates of passive resistance and nonviolence proceeded to do just that at one point a coterie of clergymen stormed the pulpit in an effort to keep the claimant to the throne off the speakers platform this resulted in the death of an elderly pastor and parttime mortician from detroit who fell off the back of the platform with another minister on top of him yet this is becoming an annual ministerial pastime and it is getting so nobody is willing or able to predict what might happen when negro baptist preachers convene however the conventioners eventually grow tired or perplexed by the debating of roberts rules of order and general parliamentary procedure then nominate unanimously or reelect the entire slate of candidates by a standing vote anyway the devotion to squabbling in addition to the annual and semiannual exhibitions of ministerial efforts to outpower one another negro churchdom is burdened with a continuous circus of church splits walkouts court suits and demands for recounts and new elections right on down to the local pastorates with such models before them it is no wonder that members do likewise when former heavyweight contender hurricane jackson was fighting and singing in a new york baptist choir he was impelled to drop out long before leaving the prize ring because they squabbled too much for him the same thing was borne out by my own past experience as a choir member in oklahoma and virginia the devotion to squabbling pervades most business meetings where pastors purport to preside over the transacting of church politics and finance but generally wind up invading the business or private affairs of various members some such meetings end in a battle of the trustees as was recently reported in the press regarding a clash between the pastor and deacons of a church in wilmington delaware police called to the ruckus said they found the meeting in a state of bedlam and several trustees were hospitalized for broken noses and lacerated cheeks the preeminence of the collection plate the fact that money matters increasingly are at the root of pastormember relations is apparent in the tendency to measure the success of a given sunday by the size of the collection lifted estimates of the collection consume the bulk of the banner and bulletin board publicity and the necessity for squeezing the utmost from the congregations tightmouthed pocketbooks is the source of the solemn sequence of offertories many an inexperienced church goer has proudly and selfrighteously placed a large bill in the first offering only to be confronted by a multiplicity of subsequent trays for foreign missions home missions guest speakers the pastor and last but not least the eternal building fund the perpetual construction of elaborate church houses giving rise to the preeminence of the collection plate in church circles is perpetrated by ministers largely as monuments to their earthly esteem the quest for conspicuous repute also is the major motivation for the various days programs where ministers can play at messiahship and otherwise bask in superficial divinity there are to name a few appreciation days anniversaries silver and golden although greenbacks always reign supreme institutes womens day mens day sisters day deacons day may day and just about every other kind of day short of judgment day although they will get around to that eventually this also reflects the widespread flair for pomposity and the spectacle which leads many pastors to promote the bizarre at the expense of the beneficial thus as carter g woodson the late historian once wrote in his miseducation of the negro ministers dont come any more so much to feed the multitude as they come to fleece the flock this is not due however simply to the love of money as some persons believe but is one aspect of the quest for conspicuous renown i say this in spite of the fact that many do have a fetish for big fine cars church station wagons and tailormade suits which in turn are deadly attractive to fast fashionable women inside and outside the church tall in the pulpit accordingly it will be boasted say that the national baptist convention of the usa inc is one of the most powerful organizations in the world and its presidency referred to as a juicy plum in their local churches some pastors parade as little emperors even the control of nationally elected officials is so great the representation of as many as colored christians at a given religious confab will pivot on the whims of the president when the largest conference on race relations ever held by religious groups of all racial derivations in america was scheduled for chicago in midjanuary of the largest negro group was the only major group in the country which did not accept an invitation to send official participants the reason according to a reporter for the chicago defender the president himself a chicago resident and pastor misconstrued the invitation to request his personal participation rather than the groups the president went on to explain that his position as chairman of the american negro emancipation centennial authority would not allow him personally to take part although he might occasionally find time to drop in as a spectator the true reason probably derived from the fact that as some ministers complained not enough negroes were represented on the planning and steering committee and as platform speakers although the conference allegedly was an effort in the first place to get white ministers participating for a change in the negros quest for freedom in all fairness however it should be said that ministers frequently do adopt a shareandsharealike policy with reference to whatever superfluous power they may attain indeed they promiscuously bestow titular blessings and honor on secular individuals a leading baptist group in chicago was so impressed by millionaire s b fullers cosmetics talk on religion in business and business in religion that it licensed the businessman for the ministry but without full rights in that he can preach in the pulpit but cannot preside over baptisms sacraments and marriage vows but i do not myself expect a ministers license for the things i have said here on the same subject of politics and business in religion as i unlike fuller and a number of leading ministers am neither rich nor a politician predictably one of the most popular recipients of superfluous honor from negro pastors is the rich white individual whenever he will accept recently a citation was presented to republican governor rockefeller following a nonpolitical address by a baptist minister in brooklyn new york the governor was cited as baptist layman of the year and of course a collection was lifted for the multimillionaire white ruler it was said that the relatively penniless congregation really dug into its pockets to come up with a whopping offering since ministers have told them that to him who hath shall be given however the governor was politic or political enough to donate the money in turn to one of the churchs moneyraising projects politicking preachers others who suffer from a want of power instead of a superfluity grope for recognition outside the confines of the congregation proper indeed beyond the boundaries of churchdom some however such as adam clayton powell and chicagos archibald carey reign supreme in both spheres but most are doomed to political dawdling and thus their political escapades less frequently come to light other ministers have been known to use their special position in the negros struggle due to their freedom from white economic pressure and the traditional white preference for their brand of rebellion and their access to a more or less permanent multitude of readymade followers to appease the passion for presiding and the search for publicity some fellow ministers even chastized a chicago batch who left the most segregated city in the world residentially according to a population research center study and flew south to fight segregation in albany georgia when that now forsaken but unintegrated city was the focus of national news coverage one group went on a much publicized missionary tour to russia since a number of africans have said they didnt want negro missionaries who have no blessings in their own country and presently a squad of ministers are crusading in jamaica much of the stamina spent hopping about from spot to spot on distant fronts might well be exerted in their own backyards at the last national baptist convention impressively generous plans were made to purchase acres in liberia to help liberian farmers get on their feet but only acres were purchased at home in highly publicized fayette county tennessee although it doesnt take newspaper headlines to point up needy negroes nary an acre was bought in the big city northern slums where droves of negroes unlike liberians are not only off their feet but actually are down on their haunches at the doorsteps of some of the most elaborate church houses in the country stiffcollar life likewise negro religious leaders have failed to help their followers tackle the problem of crime and immorality to any significant degree while strategically adopting the white policy of deriding what progress black muslims are making in that area to appease their guilty consciences they sniggle snobbishly that muslims contain all them exconvicts in defending their egos and sustaining their semblance of prestige via mechanisms of snobbishness and seclusion they shut out the very persons they are dutybound to save many ministers even draw back from the application of tight standards of morality to their own behavior they derogatorily label such norms as stiffcollar and resent with indignation any efforts to regulate the participation of themselves and their wives in excessive pleasure of a worldly nature some even laud the practice of appearing a bit mundane as modern and may even gain celebration as the swinging minister as in the case of a leading brooklyn pastor resting on peace others make use of a repertoire of showingoff behavior based mainly on lung power the chief power of a minister and related talents for oratory and the impromptu production of oral poetry but in spite of the fact that such ministers spend the balance of their time flying about the country delivering addresses they curiously get the lockjaw when it comes to speaking out against such rampart evils as the collective murder of modern war like their white counterparts they readily don uniforms and while safely out of range of actual combat assume the role of chaplains using their special contact with the divine to sanctify the killing done by young men they once taught never to kill it is not unusual moreover to read in a pastors biographical sketch printed at every turn in some weekly newspaper a longwinded account of all the theaters of war in which he has seen battle how strange that the battlefield is called a theater when most of the acting takes place during peace time certainly it is curious that the majority of negro ministers who so eloquently expound the philosophy of nonviolence have not breathed a word of warning to a single modern nationlet alone our ownregarding the folly and immorality of nuclear war they fall back along with white ministers on the consolation that god is on our side but nobody would have the gall to suggest that they are on gods side this sidling up to the lawd for reprieve from mass devilment is merely a quest for refuge from their early failure lipservant piety and copycat christianity increasingly it seems to me if negro ministers are to survive the competition with negro muslims and other temptations pulling members away from the church house they will find it necessary to rise above their role as lipservant experts for white contributions to morality so far they have failed to add to the wisdom of ancient biblical characters such as moses solomon and job resting content to parrot the conventional insights of leading white theologians this point recently was confirmed by the inadvertent testimony of rev e franklin jackson president of the washington branch of the naacp after a speech delivered by congressman adam clayton powell at a rally honoring the editor of the washington afroamerican the rev dr jackson rose to lift the offering and said to the sprinkling of whites present in the negro crowd we negroes have added just two things to religionthe spirituals and the practice of walking to the collection table the rest we borrowed from you instead of stressing those aspects of the christian religion most appropriate to the demands of the negros condition such as a policy of good deeds and sustained endeavor for selfuplift based on the admonition that everybody is responsible for his own salvation and that god helps those who help themselves ministers as a group have naively or selfishly played up poetic dictums rationalizing the negros lot and soothing his psy chological injuries such as it is better to give than to receive and the meek shall one day inherit the earthapparently by simply remaining meek and doing nothing to warrant the prize many devote the bulk of their sermons to tirades on the sinfulness of their flocks extinguishing what little selfrespect they may have had some ministers even echo the petty ethnic prejudices of white religious bodies one leading minister remarked publicly that he would rather see his daughter dead than married to a catholic he succeeded in breaking up an impending wedding of his daughter and a catholic a former white professor of mine at the university of chicago and now president of the american sociological association everett c hughes who like myself was the son of a baptist minister used to make the point that white christians have been the greatest carriers of racial prejudice for example that the world has ever known they rationalized and justified slavery for centuries and have participated in all of the major wars of modern times not to mention the holy hell of the holy crusades they failed to take the lead in the current struggle for equality of opportunity and have lagged behind the courts the schools and other secular institutions they trailed the european explorers into africa hawaii and wherever else the explorers led them they would follow now enlightened africans are saying that once we had the land and the white missionaries came and brought us the bible now we have the bible and they have the land thus while most of the current crop of negro ministers are pathological imitators of white clergymen the new negro minister must break away from such mere copycat behavior he must disdain the lure of ritualism adopted for the mere purpose of appearing proper and saintly or to gain a superficial sense of getting something done he must replace the huffing and puffing of the present breed of orators with strong deeds and sustained action based on a sound program of uplift and morality in all of these things he must resist the impulse to seek personal glory at the expense of a trusting flock this is not all of it there are other points one could make and many examples to support those already presented just as there are exceptions to many of them but these exceptions as in everything else are no refutation of the general condition on the other hand whatever exceptions may exist are the only salvation of the negro church which they can save if they are willing to suffer for the bad and if they can persuade those who have deflected from their calling to erase past missteps and set out again resolved to withstand the temptations of present and future trivia how to become a negro leader by a t hendricks it helps if you are a negro but this is not an absolutely essential requirement congressman adam clayton powell has spoken at some length on this topic therefore i shall not bore you with a needless reiteration of who runs your negro organizations in your quest to become a negro leader remember this others before you have overcome the handicap of not having been athletes or popular entertainers if you cant hit the curve ball or a high c dont fret there are other ways of getting to the top of the heap an invaluable aid to becoming a negro leader is an address outside the negro community this will give you a more objective view of those whom you will represent it also helps if your children do not attend the same public school as other negro children this too will lend a certain cool dispassion to your pronouncements on de facto school segregation and the pace at which it should be cured get mentioned in the new york times preferably denouncing malcolm_x or adam clayton powell remember one mention in the times is equal to two mentions in the new york post or four mentions in jet how often you get mentioned in the daily press will depend to a large extent upon how often their editors need someone to deplore bellicose statements by irresponsible negro militants you cannot so to speak carry the ball you must wait for the white press to dribble it to you one of the best ways to become a negro leader is to get yourself photographed with prominent white people even if you can cadge an invitation to the white house getting photographed there has its disadvantages you are likely to get lost in the mob of other negro aspirants clustered around its distinguished occupants the best way to get yourself photographed with a prominent white person is to give him an award for meritorious service in the fight for negro equality this can be rather risky though since there is always a chance that someone in your audience may recognize the honoree as a landlord who doesnt rent to negroes or an industrialist who confines his employment of negroes if at all to the janitorial level do not be discouraged the experience will be good practice for your role as negro leader you will learn how to combat such sharpeyed troublemakers you will learn or your career will perish as a negro leader you should be willing even eager to speak outagainst other negroes for instance when the white daily in your town calls up to get your comments on malcolm_xs call for civil insurrection you will not say id like to see some evidence of that statement before making any comment such nitpicking will immediately brand you as a possible supporter of extremist elements the correct reply to such a query would be violence is not the answer this will be a good phrase too to appease animallovers who may object when a negro participating in a mississippi voter registration drive cuffs a police dog who is about to fang him in the jugular vein remember you cannot go wrong with a statesmanlike violence is not the answer it will show where you stand on bloodletting another handy word is deplore like allpurpose new crisco the verb to deplore can be used to fry all sorts of things for example you can deplore racism of all kinds or you can deplore the appointment of public figures negro on the basis of race etc etc this brings us to stock phrases keep a good supply at hand remember stock phrases are an indispensable part of the rhetorical equipment of all leaders black or white use them liberally example never before in history has a people made such great strides in baseball the switchhitter has a decided advantage over the batter who swings from only one side of the plate in negro leadership you will be a leg up if you can talk out of both sides of your mouth at the same time remember there are more important things in this world than consistency you do not have to tell white audiences the same thing you tell negro audiences our negro youth is not preparing itself for the wonderful opportunities ahead goes over big with white listeners negro listeners on the other hand might get hacked especially if they have been preparing for the future by stocking up on application blanks for unemployment insurance in pursuing your goal to become a negro leader you may want to employ the researchstudy bit remember there is a vast difference between stating an obvious fact and researching an obvious fact remember too that research grants to study obvious facts can help the unemployment situation by providing jobs for deserving social workers lastly as a responsible negro leader it is encumbent upon you to let white people know we do not hate them make them feel loved a word of caution you do not have to go to such extremes as marrying one of their daughters merely to prove your point just tell them theyll be happy to take your word for it now you are on your own go out and seek your rightful place in the cosmos of the black establishment good luck and bon appetit as we read the letter by eddie b ellis jr would be interesting to note the re action of the young people in and around the negro community to the open letter that jackie robinson recently wrote to representative adam clayton powell jr jackie robinson to most of us is the symbol of the negros struggle to achieve equal rights there is no young adult in the negro world who doesnt know the jackie robinson story there are no young people in the negro community who dont hold jackie robinson in the highest esteem for we all know that this courageous man fought the cruel injustices of an ignorant society everyone knows that baseball is supposed to be the national game of the united states yet until jackie robinson the negro population onetenth of the total american public was not represented in this game we all know how branch rickey vice president of the then brooklyn dodgers dared to defy the narrowminded and the bigots to allow jackie robinson to play organized major league base ball and we all know that willie mays maury wills elston howard and all the other negro major league stars are the end result of jackie robinsons courage on the other hand we have adam clayton powell jr the son of adam clayton powell sr who was one of the pioneers in the fight for civil_rights here we have a man who as an individual has done almost singlehandedly the most to help the cause of equal rights that the negro is seeking in adam powell jr we have the single most powerful negro politician in america today in the minds of the young adults of our country the name of adam clayton powell may not be stamped as indelibly as that of jackie robinson but i am sure that it is there and it is well respected many of us who were either too young to understand or who never really took the time to learn about adam powell will surely remember our mothers and fathers speaking of him in almost reverent terms as the minister of the abyssinia baptist church in harlem we remember our parents talking of the wonderful way in which he inspired the negro people from his pulpit and gave them a sense of pride and belonging we remember hearing of how he got many negroes jobs when jobs were hard to get even for whites we remember hearing of the bread and soup lines at abyssinia baptist church feeding those who didnt have jobs and barely if any means of support and we remember how he took his fight to congress constantly we are reminded that adam powell has always been our champion and has always placed the welfare of the negro ahead of everything else and we all look up to him and respect him tremendously even though adam powell was at his best just a little before most of us reached the age of reason we have been reminded so relentlessly of all the good he has done that we regard him with the greatest admiration now we are faced with a problem the man we all know about has suddenly lashed out and with good reason at the man we have all heard about and we all wonder just what will come of it although we were told that in context adam powell is the negroes negro the fighters fighter the congressmens congressman in our time adam powell hasnt been the fighting congressman we all have heard so much about in recent years we have read so much about his absentee record and of his delinquency to his congressional duties yet because we hold adam powell on a pedestal we never questioned his motives and we saw his results and they were good hand in hand with organizations like core sclc and the naacp adam powell has been fighting bigotry and bias in america and we believe that adam powell is still our champion the national association for the advancement of colored people has long been associated with equal rights civil liberties and all the ingredients that go with the baking of an equal citizenship cake we have heard from our parents and we have seen for ourselves the work of the naacp the single most important organization in bringing about many of the civil liberties we now have and because of our ages we tend to take for granted we have been told by our parents that they didnt enjoy many of the freedoms that we scoff at lightly today and again we are confronted with a problem we hear adam powell criticize the naacp and ask for negro support in boycotting this wonderful organization in addition we hear and read jackie robinson criticizing adam powell and we are more confused than ever we all wish that adam powell would reevaluate his high office and the responsibility he has to the negro people and act accordingly we would like to be able to tell our children as our parents told us of the civil_rights fighter who by that time if he takes stock of himself and mends some of his ways will be a legend we would also like to be able to tell our children of the organization that helped our parents helped us and will help them to achieve all of those freedoms that were promised us in the constitution and bill of rights last but not least we would like to be able to tell our children of jackie robinson the great baseball player the courageous fighter the great american who helped bring it all about by simply writing an open letter to a friend the case of the athletic patsies by a s doc young he plan was neatly set the instructions were g few and simple reward was ample a brandnew sleek and expensive automobile plus expenses and other gratuities all the sports star had to do was alight from this airplane in this major city walk a few feet across the airport and shake hands with this waiting republican candidate while flash bulbs flashed and movie cameras made motion pictures but believe it or not the star athlete goofed it all up he shook hands with the wrong man not because he was in any way a stupid personfar from itbut simply because he didnt know the republican candidate he was supposed to shill for this is but one odd incident from a running ageold saga which might well be entitled the case of the athletic patsies over the years as dozens of powerhungry political candidates underestimated the intelligence of negro voters dozens of americas greatest negro athletes have been lured into their nets with promises of green dollars and the athletes often believing that they are putting over a fast one have played the strange role of momentary campaigners the allstar roster of sometimepoliticians include joe louis sugar ray robinson jackie robinson jesse owens willie mays mai whitfield andmany of his critics sayernie banks the chicago cubs infielder banks it should be noted differs from the others in an allimportant aspect which will be explained shortly yet when his chicago aldermanic candidacy was announced by republican leaders last winter more than a few veteran observers sighed well here we go again there is of course no reason why athletes shouldnt enter politics nearly everyone else does as one writer said in retort to banks critics why shouldnt he run for city council he might be right at home some of those guys have been playing ball for years ralph metcalfe the extrack ace is one athlete who has made the transition successfully a chicago alderman or city councilman for several years metcalfe one of congressman william dawsons beneficiaries ran for of fice under his own name and won similarly banks entered the aldermanic race under his own colors as did archie moore when he campaigned for a lameduck post in southern california as did monte irvin in new jersey a few years ago as did former ohio state university and chicago bears gridder bobby watkins in chicago more recently these then are not the athletic patsies of which we speak the athletic patsy per se is employed by politicians on much the same basis as cigarette manufacturers utilize the testimonial advertisement with this exception the athletic patsy doesnt necessarily smoke his candidate nor does he necessarily vote the cold calculated theory is that since negro voters idolize the athlete they will accept his advice on voting for candidates ranging downward from united states president the athlete pockets a few bucks his ego expands at the touch of a warm handshake with the candidate the publicity is gratifying but once the campaign is over win lose or drawthe athletic patsy is seldom if ever appointed to an important position nor is he consulted on such issues as civil_rights or real estate taxes he is instead a discarded tool mai whitfield the olympian was more fortunate than most athletic patsies which he freely admits he was mai was appointed to a southern california post that paid for oncemonthly meetings only recently have the top echelon of discerning politicians begun to realize that negroes dont seek advice nor votingbooth instructions at ball games what the average star athlete has to say about a political candidate means next to nothing when negroes enter the polls when the lucid highlyintelligent olympian jesse owens supported alf landon for president back in he joined a losing republican squad which suffered a worse trouncing than sonny liston administered to floyd patterson last september when joe louis went on television to question the wisdom of presidential candidate john f kennedys nowfamous telephone call to mrs martin_luther_king to inquire about her imprisoned husband few if any negro voters were swung over to richard nixon not once but twice jackie robinson the hall of fame baseball star went to bat for nixon and did something uncommon for him struck out both times in jackie plugged nixon for the united states presidency last year he supported nixon in the california governors race following jackies second political pinchhitting job for the loser a california writer observed negroes out here dont care if jackie robinson never returns to the west coast jackie a newspaper columnist who bats out cryptic retorts to his critics once explained his choice of nixon over kennedy by saying that when they met nixon looked him straight in the eye while kennedy apparently permitted his gaze to wander in the sports world this may be a legitimate test of guts soul or heart but as most experts will attest the steady gaze does not necessarily prove the truth of politicians when jackie supported nixon he exercised his constitutional rights he was free to support either nixon or kennedy the great tragedy was that jackie surely qualified by experience training and mental capacity to operate in the political firmament illadvisedly backed a loser had he been on the winning team in it is quite probable that he would be stirring up positive constructive action on the national scene today but the suspicion is that jackie didnt weigh heavily enough the fact that he was courted by politicians not because he was jackie robinson american but because he was jackie robinson internationallyknown athlete jackies services were courted and welcomed mostly because the politicians gambled that negroes who idolized him as a player would become properly starryeyed at the polls whether or not sugar ray robinson ever harbored serious political ambitions is not known but when vincent impelliteri was mayor of new york sugar ray was a handy ally to have around his harlem cafe was a gathering place for the political elite the mayor was so enamored of sugar ray that he was among the first to offer robinson consolation inside his dressing room the night he lost a bout to extreme heat and joey maxim not even sugar rays unconscious spewing of hot profanity on the mayorsugar ray was out of his mindcould break the strong bond of political friendship but now that sugar ray though probably wiser than ever before is no longer a fistic great his political stock is valued only slightly higher than that of billie sol estes enterprises aside from the fact that most athletes dont seem to realize as they reach for the easycome green dollars that negro voters do not now nor have they ever looked to them for political advice the same as they dont seek such advice in many other professional areas the athletes appear to be totally unaware of the fact that they are when asked to support a candidate momentarily merely being used as tools if the negro athlete were involving only himself no one would raise a howl but the fact is that the athlete himself the beneficiary of racial militant action sells out his own people and beggars his hardearned popularity when he shills for a politician whom he merely knows casually whose real beliefs opinions and practices he knows not mai whitfield by his own admission has yet to recover from his disillusioning experience as a sometimepolitician condensed from several thousand words this is mais story he was asked to support a candidate he was leary of politics from the beginning but militant friends of his assured him that he could help them do some good mai was encouraged as he heard these friends make excellent suggestions to the party superiors but as election time neared he realized that not one of these excellent suggestions were encompassed by the partys platform mai became ill later when as inaugural ball invitations were being passed around he and his militant friends were left emptyhanded what money id made was all gone before election time mai has confessed my friends got exactly nowhere with their proposals as usual the handkerchief heads got the gravyinvitations to the inaugural ball being most of it plus one or two meaningless appointments i decided to get the hell out of politics the ernie banks political story broke in chicagos daily newspapers like a big bomb of surprise at the time ernie was vacationing in california the announcement stirred up a giantsized hornets nest in a ward already buzzing busily with political activity political writers had to query ernie by longdistance telephone to ask if the report of his candidacy was true when hed decided to run what his platform was many political observers questioned the possibility of ernies properly serving his constituency if elected while contracted to spend much of his time out of chicago playing baseball ernie said he could manage it and cited as an example a canadian athlete whom he said combined sports and politics ernie candidly admitted that he knew little about practical politics but said hed like it especially if i can work with youth what did cubs owner phil wrigley think of his candidacy mr wrigley approved said banks hell probably vote for me quickwitted observers noted wrigley couldnt vote for banks they didnt live in the same ward while replying to another question as to his ability to function as a baseball star and politician banks said hed bridge the gap with a good office staff what was his platform banks said he hadnt constructed onehe would he said lay his platform after hed consulted his constituents when the official party organization met overwhelming refusal to back banks candidacy was voted someone claimed that banks had failed to vote in the most recent election but banks had his supporters too why shouldnt he run a beautician asked heatedly during a discussion of his candidacy hes as good as anyone else a popular newspaper columnist agreed substantially pointing out that banks was and is one of americas bestloved celebrities despite the hotglare of controversy and the longshot possibility of victory banks vowed that hed go on and fight the political fight but after the official party turned him down he was quoted as saying they sure strike you out fast up here said a man wise in race and politics theres nothing wrong with ernie banks running for city council except his timing i think hes being used by republicans who want to capitalize on his popularity they dont expect to win anywayso they dont get hurt if banks strikes out if ernie wanted to enter politics he should have waited until he was through with baseball and able to devote full time to public office too many important things come up in council meetings for our ward to be represented by a parttimer on the credit side this much could be said unlike the ageold athletic patsies banks was at least running for office not shilling for a stranger he was in a sense as was bobby watkins blazing a trail for modern stars and with a record of solid sports citizenry behind him he very well may have been paving a political success road for the future he was in case of failure using no ones face but his own to fall on banks candidacy reflected finally another credit factor modern negro athletes are slowly but surely branching out into areas of community responsibility often neglected by their counterparts of the past better educated than their predecessors they have a finer grasp of the intricacies of life they know better how to capitalize on their popularity there is no gainsaying the fact that any serious knowledgeable athlete who enters politics has a plusfactor ie his broad acceptance as launching power and the field of current sports encompasses many athletes who might very well become outstanding political leaders among them are ollie matson professional football star bill white professional baseball star walt dukes professional basketball star stan sanders rhodes scholar from whittier cal college rafer johnson exdecathlon great these and other politicallyminded negro athletes need not suffer the disillusioning experiences of the athletic patsies and they may take inspiration from this fact ralphe bunche was a basketball player the original musketeer lions of readers t yif and theatergoers vj ii throughout the world g have thrilled to the sz rt dumas writingsfor example the three musketeers and the count of monte cristo of alexandre dumas the father and camille of alexandre dumas the son now we are reminded by a book on napoleons exploits in egypt that dumas the father himself had a father who was a most remarkable manas remarkable in his way as his son or any of the characters created by that novelist this founder of the dumas dynasty was half french half negro and all hero he seems to have been as strong and brave a soldier as history records in battle there was a recklessness about him that was almost legendary he was entirely devoid of fear he possessed the divine simplicity of the negroso related the biographer herbert gorman of the first dumas one of napoleons generals general dumas father was a french nobleman and retired colonel of artillery marquis alexandreantoine davy de la pailleterie in he left france and acquired a plantation in the eastern part of santo domingo now the dominican republic on march he became the father of a son whom he named thomasalexandre the mother was a negro slave cesette dumas she died when the boy was the marquis later decided to return to paris and took with him his son then such was the custom of french noblemen with their colored sons the daughters were left behind thomas alexandre grew into an astonishingly powerful and attractive youth he enjoyed the company of many parisian ladies he was a friendly and kind hearted young fellow but his temper was easily aroused when a man insulted him in a theater box thomasalexandre simply pitched him out on the floor challenged to a duel he quickly killed his adversary because he was an expert with the sword and other weapons four years after his return to paris the yearold marquis who was becoming stingy and eccentric married his housekeeper rebuffed by his stepmother and denied funds by his father the young man told them that he was enlisting in the armyas a private i am a nobleman and a colonel the marquis exclaimed angrily you will not degrade my name to a privates rank then i will take my mothers name he retorted and as thomasalexandre dumas he joined a regiment of dragoons soon his feats of strength made him the idol of the outfit he was the only dragoon who by taking hold of one of the beams of the stable roof could hoist himself and his horse off the ground andre maurois records none of his comrades in arms could equal his feat of thrusting four weapons at the full extent of his arm in the summer of the french revolution was blazing fiercely and there were threats of peasant insurrection and looting at villierscotterets a town north of paris dumas regiment was sent there to preserve order and the townspeople turned out to welcome them marielouise labouret the daughter of a leading citizen noticed the handsome soldier and persuaded her father to select him when the residents were told to billet the troops the young people soon decided to wed and asked m labourets permission he told dumas you may marry my daughter when you are promoted to corporal within a few months the french armies were battling on several frontiers and dumas who eagerly supported the revolution was quickly raised to corporal lieutenant captain lieutenant colonel and at the age of to generaljust a week before his first child a daughter was born dumas experienced heavy combat in the pyrenees the low countries and in the alps one of his many feats was the single handed capture of a group of cavalrymen in the alps he led his troops up a steep slope by the use of climbing irons at the top was a palisade which the men could not surmount so he grasped them one after another by the seats of their pants and flung them over the wall into the ranks of the terrified enemy after alpine service dumas at was placed under the command of gen napoleon bonaparte aged for an italian campaign dumas performed prodigies of valor he captured six standards from a detachment larger than his from a spy he drew information that exposed austrian plans he routed a large army with a small one alone he held the end of a narrow bridge against a whole squadron these stories maurois insists are absolutely true a fellow general thibault called dumas the bravest strongest and most active man i have ever known his reputation in the army was extraordinary his many deeds of chivalrous daring and the athletic skill were quoted far and wide off the battlefield dumas was the kindest and friendliest of men he detested the grisly operations of the guillotine and once ordered such a machine to be chopped down and used as firewood for his men for this he was called m le humanite but in combat his enemies called him the black devil when bonaparte was assigned by the government to undertake his ill fated invasion of egypt in he immediately asked for and received the services of dumas in egypt as everywhere dumas was his courageous ceaselessly active selfhis leadership of cavalry charges threw the natives into a panic he quelled a revolt in cairo was the first man to enter the great mosque and sent a fortune to his commander with these words the value of this treasure is close to two million francs should i be killed remember that i am a poor man with a wife and child in france nevertheless relations between napoleon and dumas became strained the latter shrewdly perceived that the corsican was working only for his own glorification and that the egyptian adventure was headed for disaster dumas asked leave to return to france and his commander granted it but never forgot or forgave such desertion dumas chartered a small ship whose captain promised to land him in france but it was an unseaworthy craft and when caught in a storm it had to take refuge in a port of the kingdom of naples this region ruled by the bourbons was violently opposed to revolutionary france and dumas was imprisoned in the castle of brindisi for two years during his detention his food was systematically poisoned so that he lost his hearing and the sight of one eye he was partly paralyzed and a cancer of the stomach developed when in the spring of his th yearhe was exchanged for an austrian general his once magnificent health was shattered he was destitute when he rejoined his wife and daughter and the labourets bonaparte by that time was the allpowerful first consul to him dumas sent this letter you are aware of the misfortunes which have come upon me you are aware of the state of my purse you remember the treasure of cairo but i have other cause for griefi have been placed with other generals on the unemployed list bonaparte with typical cynicism did not reply gen dumas could not possibly be of further use to him the generals second child alexandre dumas was born july his skin was white his eyes were blue only the hair denoted his african extraction because mme dumas parents had means and were fond of their venturesome soninlaw the general lived in comfort in the country he and his little son were devotedly attached and the famous author of the future never lost his memories and admiration for his mighty sire when gen dumas was he was granted a boonpermission to hunt in the neighboring forests which now were napoleons imperial property he mounted horse for an outing but felt such pain that he was obliged to return and take to his bed he died that night that was the generalaction and adventure from the beginning to the end he was indeed the man fitted to sire the creator of dartangnan dantes and so many other heroes of war and romance charles white artist by hoyt w fuller the work of charles white has such simple directand profoundly poeticpower that it is astonishing he is not world famous well perhaps not so astonishing after all the artist is a negro characterized by great pride and integrity and his subject matter is almost invariably his own race i suppose i am trying to say something about negro people the slender softspoken artist explains negroes have been my primary theme for yearstheir beauty their feelings their aspirations there is no question that his message comes vividly through all the negro heartache and heartbreak and terror and suffering together with the indomitable spirit cry out from his work long before soul became a concept around which raceproud negroes could rally charles white was portraying it through his art for nearly six years now he has been living in altadena a los angeles suburb with a climate white terms ideally conducive to creative work his studio is a converted garage adjacent to his home and adjoining a large yard and patio but prior to moving to california he lived years on the east coast primarily in new york he admits that too much of his time in manhattan was spent in active involvemoonlighting from his regular work white designs an naacp recruitment poster fighting racial discrimination once consumed on unequal share of the artists time a striking figure mayibuye afrika is one of the original works purchased by playwright lorraine hansberry it is also available in reproduction ment with organizations at the expense of time at the drawing board but all that is behind him now while in new york he secured a good agent who still handles his work and spent a year at howard university as artistinresidence he also spent a year traveling through and over two years as a of mexico before settling down in altadena the foreign travel he now recalls as a great experieurope resident ence most of whites work is in black and white ink drawings prints woodcuts and lithography i work very slowly he says the older i get the more selfcritical i become he produces only about four or five paintings a year about eight years ago reproductions of a group of his drawings were massproduced and sold through art outlets in los angeles chicago and new york apparently none of them are available now although the prints represented some of his most moving work currently a new set of reproductions are on sale at selected outlets across the country and they too are very much in demand white now has been earning a living from his work since he was and was drawing and painting years before that he was born in chicago and it was in that city that his work first gained attention like so many chicago artists he studied at the art institute he also was an easel and mural painter and teacher with the federal art projects administration from to when he was drafted into the u s army later he studied at the art students league of new york and at the taller de grafica in mexico city his instructors included such noted painters as harry sternberg george neal edward millman alfredo zalce and briggs dyer over the years whites work has found its way into museums all over the world from moscow to brazil and even the library of congress a pennell fund purchase at least five negro universities have samples of his work as have the national academy of arts and letters and the american federation of arts the list of awards and fellowships white received between and included the john hay whitney fellowship the art institute of chicago scholarship two julius rosenwald fellowships and a grant from the national institute of arts and letters over the years his work has been exhibited in major galleries from san franciscos museum of art to manhattans metropolitan museum of art and in leading museums in leip sig germany and mexico city he painted murals at tuskegee institute hampton institute and the chicago public library white is listed in whos who in american art he is a member of artists equity association the german academy of art and the national association of artists and his work can be seen in galleries on both coaststhe aca gallery in new york and the heritage gallery in los angeles occasionally white accepts commissions to do commercial work and he recently designed covers for leontyne price record albums for rcavictor he was special graphic designer for the movie anna lucasta with sammy davis jr and eartha kitt released in by united artists he currently is designing a book on the late george washington carver for the field enterprises in chicago for many years whites work seemed to interest europeans more than americans and even those americans who admired and purchased his work were primarily white in recent years however an increasing number of negroes have been drawn to his drawings and lithos and such wellknown names as harry belafonte who owns white pieces sidney poitier roland hayes paul robeson eartha kitt and nat king cole have collections of his work this is most gratifying white says i am extremely happy that negroes are now interested in their own subjects in art a highly disciplined worker white rarely leaves his home and studio for long periods anymore and his schedule is as regular as if he were punching a clock this fall exhibitions of his work have been arranged for several european cities and a show is set for occidental college in the winter but there is no certainty that the artist will be on hand for the openings his satisfaction comes from creating it is a glorious experience being an artist he says to seek the meaning of truth reality beauty in short to meet the challenge of life through ones sensitivities for me art is a very personal intimate communicative affair he pauses reflects then goes on to the point i look to the life of my people as the fountainhead of challenging themes and monumental concepts i strive to create an image that all mankind can personally relate to and see his dreams and ideals mirrored with hope and dignity and one has only to see charles whites work to know how well he has succeeded i have nothing against white people by mary dickerson bangham have nothing against i white people so long as they stay in their place but when one of them says negroes should be shipped back to africa he has overstepped what would our country do without negroes in the sports world or in the entertainment world or in the shoeshining and windowwashing worlds what would the armed services do without negroes to fight for liberty and to uphold our democratic way of life why if negroes were shipped back to africa the white men would just have to go haul them back like they did in the first place besides if negroes should be shipped back to africa shouldnt whities be shipped back to where they came from geography sharks figurative sharks could help rout out and send those whose ancestors followed on columbus shipborne heels back to italy and spain those whose ancestors were on the mayflower passenger list to holland and england miscellaneous descendants to miscellaneous ports leaving america to the reds red indians that is this would solve the race problem in case enough ships were not available a few yellow people might be flown in from asia the red men let off the reservations and temporary relief found through this change in the balance of color population explosions might necessitate frequent rebalancing some whities say negroes have mental capacities differing from theirs to be sure not many white people have brains like george washington carvers or booker t washingtons or james weldon johnsons or marian andersons or ralph bunches or howard thurmans better end the list before some reader sees red and labels the writer a red writer is a whitie who claims the right to write while imagining herself some other hue many whities say negroes are shiftless this shifts the subject into an area where there are no restrictions it might be good for southerners who want college degrees to spend one academic year in the north where theyd learn that negroid coloring does not rub off and diplomabent northerners to spend an academic year in the south where they would learn that blacks can outnumber whitesnot on campuses of course but in certain land areas this involves problems for advanced math students some wag suggested that race problems might be solved by studying the new testament a harmless suggestion since it has not yet been banned as subversive literature however there are spots alien to our modern culture which require interpreters the fact that the entire bible appears in plain black and white causes some confusion confusion compounded by many new testaments being published with the words of jesus in red a new color scheme will surely be devised soon having a commondenominator rib adam and eve doubtless belonged to the same race but which one bible writers evidently considered it unimportant to explain humanitys variegations couldnt god have made us of one color say green since we all act pretty green at times or blue since everybody gets blue once in a while or yellow for who hasnt a yellow streak or two different colors look pretty when mixed up in the landscape prettier than monotones maybe god looks at it that way but what im really thinking about now is that ive nothing against the human race so long as it stays in its place confessions of a liberal by norman podhoretz wo ideas puzzled me v deeply as a child grow ing up in brooklyn during the s in what today would be called an integrated neighborhood one of them was that all jews were rich the other was that all negroes were persecuted these ideas had appeared in print therefore they must be true my own experience and the evidence of my senses told me they were not true but that only confirmed what a daydreaming boy in the provincesfor the lowerclass neighborhoods of new york belong as surely to the provinces as any rural town in north dakotadiscovers very early his experience is unreal and the evidance of his senses is not to be trusted yet even a boy with a head full of fantasies incongruously synthesized out of hollywood movies and english novels cannot altogether deny the reality of his own experienceespecially when there is so much deprivation in that experience nor can he altogether gainsay the evidence of his own sensesespecially such evidence of the senses as comes from being repeatedly beaten up robbed and in general hated terrorized and humiliated and so for a long time i was puzzled to think that jews were supposed to be rich when the only jews i knew were poor and that negroes were supposed to be persecuted when it was the negroes who were doing the only persecuting i knew aboutand doing it moreover to me during the early years of the war when my older sister joined a leftwing youth organization i remember my astonishment at hearing her passionately denounce my father for thinking that jews were worse off than negroes to me at the age of twelve it seemed very clear that negroes were better off than jewsindeed than allwhites a city boys world is contained within three or four square blocks and in my world it was the whites the italians and jews who feared the negroes not the other way around the negroes were tougher than we were more ruthless and on the whole they were better athletes what could it mean then to say that they were badly off and that we were more fortunate yet my sisters opinions like print were sacred and when she told me about exploitation and economic forces i believed her but i was still afraid of negroes and i still hated them with all my heart it had not always been sothat much i can recall from early childhood when did it start this fear and this hatred there was a kindergarten in the local public school and given the character of the neighborhood at least half of the children in my class must have been negroes yet i have no memory of being aware of color differences at that age and i know from observing my own children that they attribute no significance to such differences even when they begin noticing them i think there was a dayfirst grade second grade when my best friend carl hit me on the way home from school and announced that he wouldnt play with me any more because i had killed jesus when i ran home to my mother crying for an explanation she told me not to pay any attention to such foolishness and then in yiddish she cursed the goyim and the schwartzes the schwartzes and the goyim carl it turned out was a schwartze and so was added a third to the categories into which people were mysteriously divided sometimes i wonder whether this is a true memory at all it is blazingly vivid but perhaps it never happened can anyone really remember back to the age of six there is no uncertainty in my mind however that the years that followed carl and i hardly ever spoke though we met in school every day up through the eighth or ninth grade there would be embarrassed moments of catching his eye or of his catching minefor whatever it was that had attracted us to one another as very small children remained alive in spite of the fantastic barrier of hostility that had grown up between us suddenly and out of nowhere nevertheless friendship would have been impossible and even if it had been possible it would have been unthinkable about that there was nothing anyone could do by the time we were eight years old item the orphanage across the street is torn down a city housing project begins to rise in its place and on the marvelous vacant lot next to the old orphanage they are building a playground much excitement and anticipation as opening day draws near mayor laguardia himself comes to dedicate this great gesture of public benevolence he speaks of neighborliness and borrowing cups of sugar and of the playground he says that children of all races colors and creeds will learn to live together in harmony a week later some of us are swatting flies on the playgrounds inadequate little ball field a gang of negro kids pretty much our own age enter from the other side and order us out of the park we refuse proudly and indignantly with superb masculine fervor there is a fight they win and we retreat half whimpering half with bravado my first nauseating experience of cowardice and my first appalled realization that there are people in the world who do not seem to be afraid of anything who act as though they have nothing to lose thereafter the playground becomes a battleground sometimes quiet sometimes the scene of athletic competition between them and us but rocks are thrown as often as baseballs gradually we abandon the place and use the streets instead the streets are safer though we do not admit this to ourselves we are not after all sissiesthat most dreaded epithet of an american boyhood item i am standing alone in front of the building in which i live it is late afternoon and getting dark that day in school the teacher had asked a surly negro boy named quentin a question he was unable to answer as usual i had waved my arm eagerly be a good boy get good marks be smart go to college become a doctor and the right answer bursting from my lips i was held up lovingly by the teacher as an example to the class i had seen quentins facea very dark very cruel very orientallooking faceharden and there had been enough threat in his eyes to make me run all the way home for fear that he might catch me outside now standing idly in front of my own house i see him approaching from the project accompanied by his little brother who is carrying a baseball bat and wearing a grin of malicious anticipation as in a nightmare i am trapped the sursoundings are secure and familiar but terror is suddenly present and there is no one around to help i am locked to the spot i will not cry out or run away like a sissy and i stand there my heart wild my throat clogged he walks up hurls the familiar epithet hey mof r and to my surprise only pushes me it is a violent push but not a punch a push is not as serious as a punch maybe i can still back out without entirely losing my dignity maybe i can still say hey cmon quentin whaddya wanna do that for i dint do nothin to you and walk away not too rapidly instead before i can stop myself i push him backa token gestureand i say cut that out i dont wanna fight i aint got nothin to fight about as i turn to walk back into the building the corner of my eye catches the motion of the bat his little brother has handed him i try to duck but the bat crashes colored lights into my head the next thing i know my mother and sister are standing over me both of them hysterical my sistershe who was later to join the progressive youth organizationis shouting for the police and screaming imprecations at those dirty little black bastards they take me upstairs the doctor comes the police come i tell them that the boy who did it was a stranger that he had been trying to get money from me they do not believe me but i am too scared to give them quentins name when i return to school a few days later quentin avoids my eyes he knows that i have not squealed and he is ashamed i try to feel proud but in my heart i know that it was fear of what his friends might do to me that had kept me silent and not the code of the street item there is an athletic meet in which the whole of our junior high school is participating i am in one of the seventhgrade rapidadvance classes and segregation has now set in with a vengeance in the last three or four years of the elementary school from which we have just graduated each grade had been divided into three classes according to intelligence in the earlier grades the divisions had either been arbitrary or else unrecognized by us as having anything to do with brains these divisions by iq or however it was arranged had resulted in a preponderance of jews in the classes and a corresponding preponderance of negroes in the s with the italians split unevenly along the spectrum at least a few negroes had always made the ls just as there had always been a few jewish kids among the s and more among the s where italians dominated but the junior highs rapidadvance class of which i am now a member is overwhelmingly jewish and entirely whiteexcept for a shy lonely negro girl with light skin and reddish hair the athletic meet takes place in a cityowned stadium far from the school it is an important event to which a whole day is given over the winners are to get those precious little medallions stamped with the new york city emblem that can be screwed into a belt and that prove the wearer to be a distinguished personage i am a fast runner and so i am assigned the position of anchor man on my classs team in the relay race there are three other seventhgrade teams in the race two of them all negro as ours is all white one of the allnegro teams is very talltheir anchor man waiting silently next to me on the line looks years older than i am and i do not recognize him he is the first to get the baton and crosses the finishing line in a walk our team comes in second but a few minutes later we are declared the winners for it has been discovered that the anchor man on the firstplace team is not a member of the class we are awarded the medallions and the following day our homeroom teacher makes a speech about how proud she is of us for being superior athletes as well as superior students we want to believe that we deserve the praise but we know that we could not have won even if the other class had not cheated that afternoon walking home i am waylaid and surrounded by five negroes among whom is the anchor man of the disqualified team gimme my medal mofr he grunts i do not have it with me and i tell him so anyway it aint yours i say foolishly he calls me a liar on both counts and pushes me up against the wall on which we sometimes play handball gimme my mofn medal he says again i repeat that that i have left it home les search the lil mof r one of them suggests he prolly got it hid in his mof n pants my panic is now unmanageable how many times had i been surrounded like this and asked in soft tones len me a nickle boy how many times had i been called a liar for pleading poverty and pushed around or searched or beaten up unless there happened to be someone in the marauding gang like carl who liked me across that enormous divide of hatred and who would therefore say aaah cmon les git someone else this boy aint got no money on im i scream at them through tears of rage and selfcontempt keep your fn filthy lousy black hands offa me i swear ill get the cops this is all they need to hear and the five of them set upon me they bang me around mostly in the stomach and on the arms and shoulders and when several adults loitering near the candy store down the block notice what is going on and begin to shout they run off and away i do not tell my parents about the incident my teammates who have also been waylaid each by a gang led by his opposite number from the disqualified team have had their medallions taken from them and they never squeal either for days i walk home in terror expecting to be caught again but nothing happens the medallion is put away into a drawer never to be worn by anyone obviously experiences like these have always been a common feature of childhood life in workingclass and immigrant neighborhoods and negroes do not necessarily figure in them wherever and in whatever combination they have lived together in the cities kids of different groups have been at war beating up and being beaten up micks against kikes against wops against spicks against polacks and even relatively homogeneous areas have not been spared the warring of the young one block against another one gang called in my day in a pathetic effort at gentility an sac or socialathletic club against another but the negrowhite conflict hadand no doubt still hasa special intensity and was conducted with a ferocity unmatched by intra mural white battling in my own neighborhood a good deal of animosity existed between the italian kids most of whose parents were immigrants from sicily and the jewish kids who came largely from east european immigrant families yet everyone had friends sometimes close friends in the other camp and we often visited one anothers strangesmelling houses if not for meals then for glasses of milk and occasionally for some special event like a wedding or a wake if it happened that we divided into warring factions and did battle it would invariably be halfhearted and soon patched up our parents to be sure had nothing to do with one another and were mutually suspicious and hostile but we the kids who all spoke yiddish or italian at home were americans or new yorkers or brooklyn boys we shared a culture the culture of the street and at least for a while this culture proved to be more powerful than the opposing cultures of the home why why should it have been so different as between the negroes and us how was it borne in upon us so early white and black alike that we were enemies beyond any possibility of reconciliation why did we hate one another so i suppose if i tried i could answer those questions more or less adequately from the perspective of what i have since learned i could draw upon james baldwinwhat better witness is there to describe the sense of entrapment that poisons the soul of the negro with hatred for the white man whom he knows to be his jailer on the other side if i wanted to understand how the white man comes to hate the negro i could call upon the psychologists who have spoken of the guilt that white americans feel toward negroes and that turns into hatred for lack of acknowledging itself as guilt these are plausible answers and certainly there is truth in them yet when i think back upon my own experience of the negro and his of me i find myself troubled and puzzled much as i was as a child when i heard that all jews were rich and all negroes persecuted how could the negroes in my neighborhood have regarded the whites across the street and around the corner as jailers on the whole the whites were not so poor as the negroes but they were quite poor enough and the years were years of depression as for white hatred of the negro how could guilt have had anything to do with it what share had these italian and jewish immigrants in the enslavement of the negro what share had theydowntrodden people themselves breaking their own necks to eke out a living in the exploitation of the negro no i cannot believe that we hated each other back there in brooklyn because they thought of us as jailers and we felt guilty toward them but does it matter given the fact that we all went through an unrepresentative confrontation i think it matters profoundly for if we managed the job of hating each other so well without benefit of the aids to hatred that are supposedly at the root of this madness everywhere else it must mean that the madness is not yet properly understood i am far from pretending that i understand it but i would insist that no view of the problem will begin to approach the truth unless it can account for a case like the one i have been trying to describe are the elements of any such view available to us at least two i would say are one of them is a point we frequently come upon in the work of james baldwin and the other is a related point always stressed by psychologists who have studied the mechanisms of prejudice baldwin tells us that one of the reasons negroes hate the white man is that the white man refuses to look at him the negro knows that in white eyes all negroes are alike they are faceless and therefore not altogether human the psychologists in their turn tell us that the white man hates the negro because he tends to project those wild impulses that he fears in himself onto an alien group which he then punishes with his contempt what baldwin does not tell us however is that the principle of facelessness is a twoway street and can operate in both directions with no difficulty at all thus in my neighborhood in brooklyn i was as faceless to the negroes as they were to me and if they hated me because i never looked at them i must also have hated them for never looking at me to the negroes my white skin was enough to define me as the enemy and in a war it is only the uniform that counts and not the person so with the mechanism of projection that the psychologists talk about it too works in both directions at once there is no question that the psychologists are right about what the negro represents symbolically to the white man for me as a child the life lived on the other side of the playground and down the block on ralph avenue seemed the very embodiment of the values of the streetfree independent reckless brave masculine erotic i put the word erotic last though it is usually stressed above all others because in fact it came last in consciousness as in importance what mainly counted for me about negro kids of my own age was that they were bad boys there were plenty of bad boys among the whitesthis was after all a neighborhood with a long tradition of crime as a career open to aspiring talentsbut the negroes were really bad bad in a way that beckoned to one and made one feel inadequate we all went home every day for a lunch of spinachandpotatoes they roamed around during lunch hour munching on candy bars in winter we had to wear itchy woolen hats and mittens and cumbersome galoshes they were bareheaded and loose as they pleased we rarely played hookey or got into serious trouble in school for all our streetcorner bravado they were defiant forever staying out to do what delicious things forever making disturbances in class and in the halls forever being sent to the principal and returning uncowed but most important of all they were tough beautifully enviably tough not giving a damn for anyone or anything to hell with the teacher the truant officer the cop to hell with the whole of the adult world that held us in its grip and that we never had the courage to rebel against except sporadically and in petty ways this is what i saw and envied and feared in the negro this is what finally made him faceless to me though some of it of course was actually there the psychologists also tell us that the alien group which becomes the object of a projection will tend to respond by trying to live up to what is expected of them but what on his side did the negro see in me that made me faceless to him did he envy me my lunches of spinachandpotatoes and my itchy woolen caps and my prudent behavior in the face of authority as i envied him his noontime candy bars and his bare head in winter and his magnificent rebelliousness did those lunches and caps spell for him the prospect of power and riches in the future did they mean that there were possibilities open to me that were denied to him very likely they did but if so one also supposes that he feared the impulses within himself toward submission to authority no less powerfully than i feared the impulses in myself toward defiance if i represented the jailer to him it was not because i was oppressing him or keeping him down it was because i symbolized for him the dangerous and probably pointless temptation toward greater repression just as he symbolized for me the equally perilous tug toward greater freedom i personally was to be rewarded for this repression with a new and better life in the future but how many of my friends paid an even higher price and were given only gall in return we have it on the authority of james baldwin that all negroes hate whites i am trying to suggest that on their side all whitesall american whites that isare sick in their feelings about negroes there are negroes no doubt who would say that baldwin is wrong but i suspect them of being less honest than he is just as i suspect whites of selfdeception who tell me they have no special feeling toward negroes special feelings about color are a contagion to which white americans seem susceptible even when there is nothing in their background to account for the susceptibility thus everywhere we look today in the north we find the curious phenomenon of white middleclass liberals with no previous personal experience of negroes people to whom negroes have always been faceless in virtue rather than faceless in vicediscovering that their abstract commitment to the cause of negro rights will not stand the test of a direct confrontation we find such people fleeing in droves to the suburbs as the negro population in the inner city grows and when they stay in the city we find them sending their children to private school rather than to the integrated public public school in the neighborhood we find them resisting the demand that gerrymandered school districts be rezoned for the purpose of overcoming de facto segregation we find them judiciously considering whether the negroes for their own good of course are not perhaps pushing too hard we find them clucking their tongues over negro militancy we find them speculating on the question of whether there may not after all be something in the theory that the races are biologically different we find them saying that it will take a very long time for negroes to achieve full equality no matter what anyone does we find them deploring the rise of black nationalism and expressing the solemn hope that the leaders of the negro community will discover ways of containing the impatience and incipient violence within the negro ghettos but that is by no means the whole story there is also the phenomenon of what kenneth rexroth once called crowjimism there are the brokendown white boys like vivaldo moore in baldwins another country who go to harlem in search of sex or simply to brush up against something that looks like primitive vitality and who are so often punished by the negroes they meet for crimes that they would have been the last ever to commit and of which they themselves have been as sorry victims as any of the negroes who take it out on them there are the writers and intellectuals and artists who romanticize negroes and pander to them assuming a guilt that is not properly theirs and there are all the white liberals who permit negroes to blackmail them into adopting a double standard of moral judgment and who lend themselves again assuming the responsibility for crimes they never committed to cunning and contemptuous exploitation by negroes they employ to try to befriend and what about me what kind of feelings do i have about negroes today what happened to me from brooklyn who grew up fearing and envying and hating negroes now that brooklyn is behind me do i fear them and envy them and hate them still the answer is yes but not in the same proportions and certainly not in the same way i now live on the upper west side of manhattan where there are many negroes and many puerto ricans and there are nights when i experience the old apprehensiveness again and there are streets that i avoid when i am walking in the dark as there were streets that i avoided when i was a child i find that i am not afraid of puerto ricans but i cannot restrain my nervousness whenever i pass a group of negroes standing in front of a bar or sauntering down the street i know now as i did not know when i was a child that power is on my side that the police are working for me and not for them and knowing this i feel ashamed and guilty like the good liberal i have grown up to be yet the twinges of fear and the resentment they bring and the selfcontempt they arouse are not to be gainsaid but envy why envy and hatred why hatred here again the intensities have lessened and everything has been complicated and qualified by the guilts and the resulting overcompensations that are the heritage of the enlightened middleclass world of which i am now a member yet just as in childhood i envied negroes for what seemed to me their superior masculinity so i envy them today for what seems to me their superior physical grace and beauty i have come to value physical grace very highly and i am now capable of aching with all my being when i watch a negro couple on the dance floor or a negro playing baseball or basketball they are on the kind of terms with their own bodies that i should like to be on with mine and for and that precious quality they seem blessed to me the hatred i still feel for negroes is the hardest of all the old feelings to face or admit and it is the most hidden and the most overlarded by the conscious attitudes into which i have succeeded in willing myself it no longer has as for me it once did any cause or justification except perhaps that i am constantly being denied my right to an honest expression of the things i earned the right as a child to feel how then do i know that this hatred has never entirely disappeared i know it from the insane rage that can stir in me at the thought of negro antisemitism i know it from the disgusting prurience that can stir in me at the sight of a mixed couple and i know it from the violence that can stir in me whenever i encounter that special brand of paranoid touchiness to which many negroes are prone this then is where i am it is not exactly where i think all other white liberals are but it cannot be so very far away either and it is because i am convinced that we white americans arefor whatever reason it no longer matters so twisted and sick in our feelings about negroes that i despair of the present push toward integration if the pace of progress were not a factor here there would perhaps be no cause for despair time and the law and even the international political situation are on the side of the negroes and ultimately therefore victoryof a sort anywaymust come but from everything we have learned from observers who ought to know pace has become as important to the negroes as substance they want equality and they want it now and the white world is yielding to their demand only as much and as fast as it is absolutely being compelled to do the negroes know this in the most concrete terms imaginable and it is thus becoming increasingly difficult to buy them off with rhetoric and promises and pious assurances of support and so within the negro community we find more and more people declaring as harold r isaacs recently put it in these pagesthat they want out people who say that integration will never come or that it will take a hundred or a thousand years to come or that it will come at too high a price in suffering and struggle for the pallid and sodden life of the american middle class that at the very best it may bring the most numerous influential and dangerous movement that has grown out of negro despair with the goal of integration is of course the black muslims this movement whatever else we may say about it must be credited with one enduring achievement it inspired james baldwin to write an essay which deserves to be placed among the classics of our language everything baldwin has ever been trying to tell us is distilled here into a statement of overwhelming persuasiveness and prophetic magnificence baldwins message is and always has been simple it is this color is not a human or personal reality it is a political reality and baldwins demand is correspondingly simple color must be forgotten lest we all be smited with a vengeance that does not really depend on and cannot really be executed by any person or organization and that cannot be prevented by any police force or army historical vengeance a cosmic vengeance based on the law that we recognize when we say whatever goes up must come down the black muslims baldwin portrays as a sign and a warning to the intransigent white world they come to proclaim how deep is the negros disaffection with the white world and all its works and baldwin implies that no american negro can fail to respond somewhere in his being to their message that the white man is the devil that allah has doomed him to destruction and that the black man is about to inherit the earth baldwin of course knows that this nightmare inversion of the racism from which the black man has suffered can neither win nor even point to the neighborhood in which victory might be located for in his view the neighborhood of victory lies in exactly the opposite direction the transcendence of color through love yet the tragic fact is that love is not the answer to hatenot in the world of politics at any rate color is indeed a political rather than a human or a personal reality and if politics which is to say power has made it into a human and a personal reality then only politics which is to say power can unmake it once again but the way of politics is slow and bitter and as impatience on the one side is matched by a setting of the jaw on the other we move closer and closer to an explosion and blood may yet run in the streets will this madness in which we are all caught never find a restingplace is there never to be an end to it in thinking about the jews i have often wondered whether their survival as a distinct group was worth one hair on the head of a single infant did the jews have to survive so that six million innocent people should one day be burned in the ovens of auschwitz it is a terrible question and no one not god himself could ever answer it to my satisfaction and when i think about the negroes in america and about the image of integration as a state in which the negroes would take their rightful place as another of the protected minorities in a pluralistic society i wonder whether they really believe in their hearts that such a state can actually be attained and if so why they should wish to survive as a distinct group i think i know why the jews once wished to survive though i am less certain as to why we still do they not only believed that god had given them no choice but they were tied to a memory of past glory and a dream of imminent redemption what does the american negro have that might correspond to this his past is a stigma his color is a stigma and his vision of the future is the hope of erasing the stigma by making color irrelevant by making it disappear as a fact of consciousness i share this hope but i cannot see how it will ever be realized unless color does in fact disappear and that means not integration it means assimilation it meanslet the brutal word come outmiscegenation the black muslims like their racist counterparts in the white world accuse the socalled negro leaders of secretly pursuing miscegenation as a goal the racists are wrong but i wish they were right for i believe that the wholesale merging of the two races is the most desirable alternative for everyone concerned i am not claiming that this alternative can be pursued programmatically or that it is immediately feasible as a solution obviously there are even greater barriers to its achievement than to the achievement of integra tion what i am saying however is that in my opinion the negro problem can be solved in this country in no other way i have told the story of my own twisted feelings about negroes here and of how they conflict with the moral convictions i have since developed in order to assert that such feelings must be acknowledged as honestly as possible so that they can be controlled and ultimately disregarded in favor of the convictions it is wrong for a man to suffer because of the color of his skin beside that cliched proposition of liberal thought what argument can stand and be respected if the arguments are the arguments of feeling they must be made to yield and ones own soul is not the worst place to begin working a huge social transformation not so long ago it used to be asked of white liberals would you like your sister to marry one when i was a boy and my sister was still unmarried i would certainly have said no to that question but now i am a man my sister is already married and i have daughters if i were to be asked today whether i would like a daughter of mine to marry one i would have to answer no i wouldnt like it at all i would rail and rave and rant and tear my hair and then i hope i would have the courage to curse myself for raving and ranting and to give her my blessing how dare i withhold it at the behest of the child i once was and against the man i now have a duty to be by william barrow hen ivory coast w president felix houphouetboigny arrived in washington for a state visit in what he brought with him was not merely a feeling of friendship for the united states seldom found among african leaders brought to brainwashed americans a startling new image of afwomanhood for he also when marie even rican svelte cool and elegant therese houphouetboigny stepped off the plane that had whisked her in from paris the most prejudiced of the washington correspondents had to admit thatby any standards they chose to judgehere was an exquisite lady during the few days that president and madame houphouetboigny were white house guests washington society was agog at state function or informal luncheonwhenever she appearedthe cocoacolored african beauty effortlessly seized the spotlight not only did she possess a natural grace worthy of a princess but she was invariably attired in clothes befitting a queen out of socalled darkest africa had emerged a jewel so brilliant as to light up the capital of the worlds most powerful nation for a first lady of such uncommon charm it perhaps was inevitable that marie therese houphouetboigny would be compared to jacqueline kennedy the press dubbed her africas jackie meaning to compliment her and there are indeed points of similarity between the two beauties madame houphouetboigny like mrs kennedy is familiar with the life of paris although the african first lady lived there for several years while the american first lady studied there only briefly and like mrs kennedy madame houphouetboigny is a connoisseur of fine clothes good art and gourmet food an advocate of excellence but there the similarities all but end madame houphouetboigny was born marie therese brou years ago in one of the suburbs of abidjan capital of the ivory coast at she was dispatched along with other local girls to private schools in france there she grew up learning all that was accessible absorbing all the bountiful culture about her at she met and then married the most powerful man in her country mrs kennedy on the other hand was born to wealth and the man she married was just one of senators when they exchanged wedding vows as the wife of the chief of the most prosperous country in frenchspeaking africa marie therese houphouetboigny cannot help but set the pace in style and breeding and accomplishment for the young women of africa she is a splendid example if marie therese houphouetboigny is a paragon in the realm of politics and power leontyne price is her match in the lofty world of grand opera if not the prima donna assoluta of grand opera then miss price is unquestionably her closest rival a tall stately creature with the voice of a fullblooded angel and the grace of a lithelimbed cat she fills the operatic stage with an almost unbearable excitement from milan to manhattan and in all the musical centers in between leontyne price has been hailed as one of the great sopranos of all time hers is a classic story born in a little mississippi town brought up in the poor but dignified manner native to so many southernbred negroes there was no logical reason why her star should have ascended to such heights she sang in the church choir and studied music and voice as have thousands of girls from similar towns and families and finally she managed to go away to college wilberforce where she studied education in preparation for a career as a teacher but leontyne price had an ambition which would not be stilled and she had a voice the ambition was to stand on the stage of the metropolitan opera house and sing and she aimed to shape her voice toward that moment soon the students and faculty members at wilberforce had joined with the people of laurel miss in praising miss prices singing and when famed baritone paul robeson heard her on the campus fate stepped in robeson sang a benefit that raised for leontynes expenses at the juilliard school of music in new york and the way was clear few music lovers who heard leontyne price sing remained unmoved and her climb to the top rung in the music world was marked by successive encounters with experts who came to listen and stayed to praise producer robert breen cast her as bess in his revival of porgy and bess the national broadcasting company dared to star her on tv as the highpowered tosca and the eminent herbert von karajan made plans to feature her on the opera stage in europe her grand opera career began in when she sang in dialogues of the carmelites with the san francisco opera in the next two years she sang the lead role in aida in san francisco and at londons covent garden then von karajan invited her to sing the ethiopian princess at the vienna state opera and leontynes conquest of europe began she sang at salzburg and at berlin and finally at la scala and when she came home to open the met in ii trovatore in her triumph was complete now at the pinnacle of her success la price is one of a small group of superlative sopranos who can virtually write their own

brooksthat poets have so little honor in our land for this poet has the power to elevate our spirits and to enrich our souls in fact for that lucky minority of poetry lovers miss brooks has been providing elevation and enrichment for almost years since her first book of poems a street in bronzeville brightened the literary horizon back in those poems told all about life in the modest neighborhoods of chicagos south side that then boxedin area of the city where negroes were contained the walls of that particular ghetto have since crumbled and the people have spilled out southward and westward enlarging the ghetto formlessly but inexorably and the poems are marked by a simple beauty that is almost unbearable four years later following publication of her second book of poems annie allen gwendolyn brooks was awarded a pulitzer prize in harper published miss brooks first novel maud martha the novel like her poems is simple in structure spare and small and as deceptively potent as vodka lurking in orange juice it is the story of an ordinary negro woman making her way and a life in that same chicago ghetto and its statement of the human condition is profoundly moving it is unmistakably a poets work in the nearly ten years since maud martha there have been new poems from gwendolyn brooks and one of them an elegy to her novelist friend frank london brown was published in the september issue of negro digest she has appeared on various lecture platforms participated in a poets whingding at the library of congress resided at yaddoo presided at university classes and all the while she has worked on her second novel and all the while she also has worked at the most important job a woman can havethat of a mother gwendolyn brooks the poet is also mrs

poet a triumvirate of callings which in gwendolyn brooks add up to a truly fabulous female diahann carroll is as glamorous as gwendolyn brooks is not she is a member of that galaxy of glittering personalities who illuminate the world of show business she is young and lovely and marvellously talented and a broadway star few women in any era have had plays tailored to their special dimensions and miss carroll is one of that select few richard rodgers wrote the music and lyrics for no strings with miss carroll in mind and thousands of happy theatergoers have been applauding the decision ever since the qualities which attracted mr rodgers to diahann carroll have been drawing people to the harlemborn young lady ever since she was a gangly teenager she won a metropolitan opera audition was accepted by the high school of art and music was selected as a fashion model won a role in the broadway musical house of flowers and became a featured singer on the luxury supper club circuit from there it was a simple step into movie stardomfirst in carmen jones and finally in paris blues when early in the spring of miss carroll stepped out on the broadway stage as the elegant young americaninparis mannequin in the musical no strings all the nation knew that a big new star had set some years separate the ascendant stars of diahann carroll and josephine baker but there are interesting points of coincidence in the real and stage lives of the two famed entertainers in no strings miss carroll displays a wardrobe fit for a queen in fact the lithe little ladys closest competitor for attention in the musical are the exquisite clothes designed by donald brooks when a decade ago the great josephine baker swept back into her native country on a theater tour the furs and gowns she brought with her from paris all but stopped each show and while miss carroll plays the role of an american model in paris josephine baker wasfor a long timethe model on which parisians constructed their ideas of american negro girls it was back in the early twenties when miss baker a longstemmed dancer out of st louis arrived in paris in one of her routines the daring young missourian wore a banana and not much else and paris went up in flames within record time jo baker was a folies bergere star and her name a theatrical byword fortune followed fame and soon la baker had furs the finest jewels salons in the city and chateaux in the country she was the darling of all france worshipped and pursued and she gave her heart in return to france and to frenchmen she made movies records appeared in revues and musicals and lived the life of the celebrated grande dame when war came to france josephine baker joined the french resistance forces at one point she was reported dead but months later following the fall of the vichy government she turned up very much alive in north africa where she had been tending wounded french soldiers the war over she returned in triumph to paris and grateful france awarded her the coveted legion of merit while jo baker the entertainer remained as great and as much in demand as ever jo baker the woman emerged from her war experiences profoundly changed she had witnessed firsthand the horror and brutality of war and she remembered the racial inequities of her childhood and suddenly she knew she had to do something useful with her life she embarked on a world tour found fabulous success everywhere including even americaand returned to france to begin an important new phase in her life with her husband jo bouillon jo baker purchased a huge chateau and grounds acres near perigord then she began adopting children of all races and creeds from all over the world using income from her tours to support them at last count a total of children were established in the bakerbouillon household at les milandes keeping what amounts to a whole town a chateau a platoon of servants and children demands a great deal of money and josephine baker has only her name and her talent on which to capitalize at then long after most entertainers have retired from the glamour derby the remarkable jo baker is still touring the world still dazzling audiences still earning a kings ransom she has indeed come a long way from st louis andfrom all indicationsshe still will go a long way freedoms song safe to say that the freedom movement in the south is a singing movement this is somewhat to be expected when one considers that music has strange power to evoke various emotional responses in the human animal it has historically been of special value to the oppressed in every age somehow the literature and idiom of music makes possible the restoration of lost hopes it binds up the wounds of the brokenhearted and by its character welds together the cohesive sentiment of a group of people of common experience in the experience of the children of israel particularly that of the period of the captivity we are able to see some evidence of this in the literature of the psalms extrabiblical sources reveal that the psalms were chanted in unison or antiphonally expressive of the particular emotion and experience to be conveyed one illustration suffices to indicate the significant role of singing during the captivity of the house of israel the th psalm infers that in the midst of despair the children of israel were tempted to stop singing by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for they that carried us away captive required of us a song sing us one of the songs of zion how shall we sing the lords song in a strange land and then the affirmation that despite the captivity the body and spirit of israel could only be held together by holding on to their faith through the only apparent medium available the singing of the psalter that stirred the fires of faith if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if i do not remember thee let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem the faith of the nation in jehovah above my chief joy the history of hymnody details the role of music in the early church it was the thread of faith that bound the believers together in the face of the oppressive cruelty of the roman empire most revolutionary movements have been singing movements the overthrow of the czarist regime in russia and the rise of the labor movement in america are instances where music played its role it has been thus with the negro and perhaps uniquely the negro himself created the music that is helping to emancipate him the negro spiritual is the primal art form of the musical literature of america the religious folk melodies of the antebellum negro produced in turn the negro folk song which in turn evolved into the blues and thence into what we know now as jazz across the years the negro spiritual has maintained its integrity and its message while the perverted form of the spiritualthe blues songhas developed many different forms i use the word perverted here advisedly the spiritual is distinguished from blues primarily by its ultimate expressionspirituals though they speak of travail and woe are faithfilled and hopeful the blues while utilizing very much the same basic musical idiom is a song of despair and hopelessness i wish to submit that the negro spiritual the one pure music art form that america has produced has played a strategic role in holding together the threadbare hopes of a people reduced to chattel slavery and has served across the last years of emancipation to persuade them that a better day is coming from our present vantage point it is perfectly clear that the recent nonviolent thrust of the negro community might not have had the vitality and dynamism that it has were it not for the impact of the negro spiritual the natural response to music coupled with the deep meaning of the negro spiritual has produced a unique effect on the freedom movement in the south it must always be remembered that religious orientation of the freedom movement intensifies the effect produced perhaps it should be said that the freedom movements natural character of being religiously orientated is inseparable from the effect of the music of the negro spiritual they are each a supplement of the other the place of the negro spiritual in the musical literature of america has not always been clearly understood the negro community itself is just now becoming aware historically speaking of the spirituals critical significance to the communitys own development and progress we have set forth in an earlier lecture that had there been no negro church there would be no negro communitythat is a cohesive sociological grouping capable of influencing the mainstream of american life by the same token the faith expressed in the negro spiritual had very much to do with keeping the negro church intact there was a time not too long ago when the negro spiritual was somewhat in illrepute as far as a large part of the negro community was concerned they were naturally associated with the slaveexperience and many negroes were not willing to identify themselves with what they considered slave songs this was in large measure due to an effort not to identify with the group psychologists call this attitude produced by the system of segregation and discrimination selfhate mistakenly the negro of the middle class particularly as he laboriously improved his lot economically socially and educationally felt the negro spiritual represented a leftover from an era that had passed and the continued use of music was deemed out of date with the progressive age of which the negro was slowly becoming a part quite naturally the survival of any tradition written or sung depends largely upon the ethnic group from which it sprang this accounts for a decline in their use and for a while the infrequent attention given them as a genuine part of the musical literature of america progressive negro churches rarely found use for the negro spiritual save in the informal services where singing might occur without the accompaniment of piano or organ as the negro church became more structured and emotionalism began to decline there followed less frequent use of spirituals fortunately though there were some with vision and insight who recognized the real worth of this body of musical literature and who took definite pains to see that it was preserved in message content and idiom notable in these efforts were the fisk jubilee singers and the college choirs of many of the small churchrelated negro colleges in the south professor j w work dr r nathaniel dett harry burleigh and james weldon johnson did much to codify and preserve in writing the words and music of the negro spiritual that had existed for nearly two generations by oral tradition alone the dedication and persistence of these groups and persons over a period of years helped to awaken a new interest and appreciation in the religious folk songs of the negro the programs of roland hayes and marian anderson were never without a section given solely to negro spirituals they insisted on including them out of their honest concern and belief that the spiritual was a part of the great musical literature of the world for these worldrenowned artists it was only incidental that they themselves happened to be members of the community in which this strange and sometimes haunting music was bom during the last fifteen years there has been a revival of interest in the negro spiritual we have come to understand that the negro spiritual is not a slavesong at all true enough they were spawned in the midst of the slave experience but their message belies hope in a better day these songs are rather the portraits of the souls of men who though their bodies were shackled expressed in unmistakable terms that their spirits were free close scrutiny of the words of the negro spiritual evidences their absolute timeliness every genuine spiritual has a biblical origin and the truth of the bible is still as fresh as tomorrow mornings newspaper no real indictment can be made that the negro spiritual is out of date or oldfashioned as far as the inference made by many that the emotional content of the spiritual made them less appropriate for use in the formal service of the church the best expression of religion is one that is in proper balance emotionally and intellectually the extremes of emotionalism and intellectualism leave much to be desired when it comes to meaningful worship somewhere between the two extremes the proper balance of thought and feeling can produce a worship experience that is intellectually challenging and emotionally satisfying thus for me and an ever increasing number of devotees the spirituals of the negro fit with grace and facility into the worship order of any protestant church it is not unusual today to discover the spirituals being used in white churches as well as negro churches with considerable regularity let us consider the negro spiritual for a few moments purely as musical literature the masters of music tell us that for a body of musical literature to be adjudged as great music at least three essentials are required nobility of theme dignity of expression and originality of thought and medium the great body of the spirituals generally answer these basic requirements let us consider them one at a time nobility of theme the familiar spiritual go down moses represents a clear example of this one must consider the tremendous odds against which the antebellum negro labored to fashion his religious faith most of it was acquired through what he was able to glean from reading of the bible by the slave master and slave mistress it was transmitted then by rote to the other members of the slave community it is something short of miraculous that these slave people were able at all to gain clear insight into the meaning of the bible stories distill them through their own experience as slaves and create a musical idiom that was neither devoid of theological content nor the basic faith of the old and new testament the spiritual go down moses reflects the slave communitys perception that their own experience was a parallel to the slave experience of the house of israel under the egyptians and when intoned by them evidenced their faith that one day god would send them a moses to tell the pharaohs of the slave system to let gods people the slaves go what more noble theme could there be dignity of expression if you have heard the words of any spiritual and are familiar with broken dialect common to them all i suppose at moments there is the temptation to laugh it must be remembered however that the slave community was composed of a people who had been uprooted from their homeland against their will transported to a strange land and very often there existed the possibility of as many as forty different dialects being spoken the broken english they used was their feeble attempt to express themselves in a strange language and be understood however humorous their phonetic attempts were it must be kept in mind that the antebellum negro never intended anything funny his was a deadly serious attempt to convey through musical expression what he believed ultimately it was this music which did more than anything else to keep body and soul together one such spiritual de blin man stood in de road and cried exhibits the simple faith of the negro in the lord jesus christ to heal him from his diseases as he healed the blind man bartimeus who cried out for mercy along the jericho road as the galilean prince had mercy on a man born blind it was the hope and belief of the negro that he would be merciful to him in the affliction of slavery no matter how broken the dialect it was a sincere attempt to voice some facet of his personal and group faith thus the spiritual despite its brokenenglish quality does in fact possess a dignity of expression originality of thought and medium it is now generally conceded that the music of the negro spiritual is original to the negro in so far as any folk music is original of those who sometimes still assert that the negro folk idioms are derivations of revival hymns the question might be pertinently asked where is that wonderful matrix of hymnology out of which has grown these song jewels of negro spirituals it has long been accepted as scientifically true that the black man brought his musical idiom with him from his native land as he must have brought his susceptibility to religious suggestion it would of course be unreasonable to suppose that this idiom was entirely unaffected by environment further the wordpicture drawn in the poetry of the spirituals is matchless one such example is sometimes i feel like a motherless child the doleful intonations of this spiritual and the lucid description of how wretched the singers fortunes have become combine to telegraph immediately the deep sorrow though still buttressed by hope his condition is such that he feels as a child without a mother the one upon whom the child is totally dependent a long way from home this is philosophical selfanalysis this one example belies both originality of thought and medium the body of musical literature that embraces the negro spiritual fulfills the essentials for that which makes great music we can never know fully what the ability of the black man to improvise his troubles into artforms has meant to him very likely it serves as a sort of safety valve for his pent feelings saving the country from an even greater tragedy than that precipitated by the civil war and himself from a disaster equally great the paramount contribution of the negro spiritual is that it has brought to the world a great message of goodwill one of the most outstanding characteristics of all the songs is that free as the music is from cacophony and discord just as remarkably free is its poetry from any word of bitterness anger or reproach whatever the condition or circumstance the music of the negro spiritual plumbs the depths of human experience when he felt like giving up he would chant stay in de field until de war is ended in his moments of meditation and reflection he sang every time i feel the spirit moving in my heart i will pray in the midst of his troubles he would sing soon i will be done with the troubles of the world when he was remiss from the discipline of his faith he cried in penitence its me its me o lord standing in the need of prayer when death came close in confidence of another life he sang swing low sweet chariot cornin for to carry me home let us consider the character of the negro spiritual every genuine spiritual is easily earmarked by some very similar characteristics most of the spirituals if not all evidence certain basic qualities which warrant reviewing let me briefly discuss them the order is purely arbitrary the negro spiritual is characterized by its deep biblicism there is always a definite bible reference for the negro spiritual they were coined within the context of their deep religious faith and we find in them the clearest expression of the faith of the antebellum negro the titles ring with biblicism walk togedder children ride on king jesus didnt my lord delibered daniel and ole time religion are but a few to illustrate their biblical posture the spirituals possess a simple and repetitive musical idiom generally speaking the lyrics and music of the negro spiritual have a basic theme which is varied only slightly to differentiate between the refrain and stanza eg come by here ma lord come by here come by here ma lord come by here come by here ma lord come by here o lord come by here the stanzas continue in the same idiom and identical rhythm somebody needs you lord come by here somebody needs you lord come by here somebody needs you lord come by here o lord come by here this quality especially lent the spiritual to group and memory singing the spiritual was not only an expression of faith it was at times a device many many spirituals have double or codemeaning we could safely presume that for the most part the spirituals were created in their original form out of a genuine religious need and later on acquired the double codemeaning this is not to say that some genuine spirituals were not created out of a specific circumstance that required subterfuge and the spiritualmedium was the safest way to transmit the information without drawing suspicion chroniclers of the days of the underground railroad attest to the usefulness of some of these religious folksongs in making their operation a success story one such spiritual that was used for a secondary purpose is the familiar steal away when some of the plantation owners detected that the christian faith was spawning ferment in the slave community and surmised that perhaps they might be better off wihout the instruction in the bible from northern missionaries who frequented the south they forbade the slaves from attending the camp meetings this spiritual was used to alert the slaves from one field to another the day and place of the meeting the day on which the singing of this hymn occurred signaled the meeting to be set for that night and improvised stanzas indicated the precise location of the meeting viz across the river in the grove or trees etc sometimes it was used to signal another movement of the underground railroad this was the significance of the last line in the refrain in this instance i aint got long to stay here the use of the spirituals for their second or codemeaning has been varied and numerous another discernible quality of the negro spiritual is that of possessing profound thelogical content the mystique of the negro spiritual aside from their birth and existence is that their messages make sense theologically we must not overlook the fact that these people had no judeochristian heritage upon which to lean it is unlikely that the concept of monotheism had any meaning at all to them yet illequipped as they were and with the fragmented bits of faith they managed to forage as leftovers from the masters table they were perceptive enough to capture the meaning of what they believed and transmit it into religiomusical expression this is nothing short of fantastic the spiritual o lord i want to be a christian inamy heart a classic speaks the eternal truth that an individuals commitment to faith and religion must be something that is internal as over against that which is external it was as well a gentle gibe at the religious practice of the slave holder from whom he had siphoned his faith we cannot overlook the eternality of the message the negro spiritual lived primarily because of the timelessness of what it seeks to say this quality perhaps is a corollary of its deep biblicism the spiritual you got to walk dat lonsome valley you got to walk it for yoself underscores the eternal fact that each man must someday die and within the context of the christian faith must stand in the judgment on the basis of his personal faith and not that of another the words are searching and eternal you got to walk dat lonsome valley you got to walk it for yo self o nobody else can walk it for you you got to walk it by yo self the final two qualities can be mentioned together the spirituals are given to improvisation and are best rendered nonaccompanied by musical instruments the proper rendition of the religious folk songs of the negro makes the voices the accompaniment and the instruments much of the musical literature of the negro spiritual is designed to be sung antiphonally and coupled with its repetitive character it is readily understandable that a great group of voices could be handled as an organ expressive of many nuances of the negros songfilled faith it is the latter quality also that encouraged members of the group by design or spontaneity to take the lead and create in the midst of a rendition a new stanza once the pace or beat of the spiritual was established no great genius was required to fashion a line that would properly fit the musical idiom and the basic message of the hymn this new stanza would immediately receive the choral support of the others singing in the group this onthespot improvisation was and still is common in the singing of the spirituals how has the negro spiritual served the freedom movement in the south we have already set forth in an earlier paper in some detail the relationship of the negro church to the nonviolent revolution in the south against this background it is no mystery that with the negro communitys social life focused in the church and his protest movements religiously oriented it would follow that the music of the movement similarly would be that which is most informal and expressive of the deep yearnings of the ethnic group from which it has sprung it is an oddity that the introduction of the negro spiritual into the movement as a means of clear group expression of common goals and united efforts was through a young white folksinger guy carawan for many years mr carawan had traveled the south searching out the history and variations of negro folk music out of his own appreciation for them as a genuine artform and in an effort to develop his skills in interpreting the music of the negro that he used in his repertoire consciously aware of the value of music to unify and rally groups around a common aim mr carawan began to adapt the musical idiom of the negro spiritual familiar to all with new words geared to the new thrust for freedom in the south in conjunction with workshops sponsored by the highlander folk school at monteagle tennessee and public appearances around the south mr carawan collected and edited those songs most easily adaptable and most familiar it did not take very long for the idea to catch on in the various communities that he visited and individual protest movements began coining their own adaptations much of the content of present day freedom songs was worked out in jails of the southland as a means of killing the inevitable boredom of jailstaying and as a morale booster to those confined so much has the practice developed that it is taken for granted in any instance of jailgoing that the singing of freedom songs is the order of the day some of the freedom fighters in the south have paid severe disciplinary penalties in the prisons of the south because they insisted on singing in jail in my own experience of a halfdozen jailings the singing of the freedom hymns or songs has been for me an indispensable aid without which the jail experience might have been totally intolerable let me illustrate now the process of transference of a spiritual to the freedom hymn i have listed below first the spiritual as it appears in an original form then to the right the adapted typical form which is used in the movement i want jesus to walk with me i want jesus to walk with me yes i want jesus to walk with me yes i want jesus to walk with me all along my pilgrim journey all along this freedom journey lord i want jesus to walk with me lord i want jesus to walk with me in many instances the variation is at best slight as above the stanza of the original form is easily adaptable to the theme of the particular focus of the movement see below when im in trouble lord walk with me when im in trouble lord walk with me all along my pilgrim journey lord i want jesus to walk with me down in the jailhouse lord walk with me down in the jailhouse lord walk with me all along this freedom journey lord i want jesus to walk with me one of the most popular adaptations used by the albany georgia movement follows woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on jesus woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on jesus woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on jesus hallelu hallelu hallelujah woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on freedom woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on freedom woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on freedom hallelu hallelu hallelu hallelu hallelujah this example perhaps is one of the oldest of the spiritual forms but lends itself just as easily to the freedom hymn principle if you want to get to heaven do what jesus says if you want to get to heaven do what jesus says if you want to get to heaven do what jesus says hallelujah amen if you want to get your freedom register and vote if you want to get your freedom register and vote if you want to get your freedom register and vote hallelujah amen even the antebellum slaves had freedom songs one such hymn still a classic required only modernizing the stanzas oh freedom oh freedom this spiritual hymns refrain is and before id be a slave sung in its exact original form id be buried in my grave and go home to my lord and be free i have placed the original stanzas and the modern stanzas in juxtaposition to illustrate the principle we have been describing no more weeping etc no more segregation etc no more moaning etc no more jim crow etc and another over my head i see trouble in the air over my head i see trouble in the air over my head i see trouble in the air there must be a god somewhere over my head i see freedom in the air over my head i see freedom in the air over my head i see freedom in the air there must be a god somewhere numerous other spirituals lend themselves to the adaptations illustrated above but space will not permit their inclusion here they embrace such religious folk songs as amen in which the word freedom is inserted to replace the title word git on board little children in which the freedom train is substituted for gospel train and countless others we have mentioned earlier that the overriding theme of the spiritual music is the determined faith of its creators that a better day is coming it is safe to say and accurately so that the same theme permeates the message and fervor of the freedom hymns that have been constructed in the frame idiom and beat of the original music of the enslaved negro community the greatgrandchildren of the antebellum negro are singing of their travail four generations removed with considerably more determination and the better day considerably closer the theme song of the nonviolent movement we shall overcome is infused with that same optimism though the original form of this freedom hymn is an old prayer meeting hymn some oldtimers say the prayermeeting hymn developed from a religious folk song at any rate whatever its origin the integrity of its message has not been lost in its evolution nor in the modem adaptation within the nonviolent movement in the south for the sake of comparison the two forms are arranged as were the earlier examples ill overcome ill overcome we shall overcome we shall overcome ill overcome someday we shall overcome someday someoooh if in my heart i do not yield day ill overcome someday oooh deep in my heart i do believe we shall overcome someday one cannot describe the vitality and emotion this one hymn evokes across the southland i have heard it sung in great mass meetings with a thousand voices singing as one ive heard a halfdozen sing it softly behind the bars of the hinds county prison in mississippi ive heard old women singing it on the way to work in albany georgia ive heard the students singing it as they were being dragged away to jail it generates power that is indescribable it manifests a rich legacy of musical literature that serves to keep body and soul together for that better day which is not far off the lesson of birmingham the experience of birmingham preaches that the administration must quickly seize and act on the truth that the accent in race relations has moved from gradual to speed it must litigate it must exert executive power in connection with many federal construction and job training programs more vigorously and imaginatively than it has it must stand ready with troops to keep the peace justly and impartially for a number of southern governors are either not willing to do so at all or if willing intend to keep an unjust racist peace and the administration must be prepared to conciliate and mediate as assistant attorney general marshall did in birmingham and has done in other southern cities to the end that the parties may begin to work out among themselves problems to whose solution the law is not equal as yet and to whose complete and stable solution it may never alone be equal since robert kennedy and burke marshall will not always be in their present jobs it would be useful now to enlarge and formalize this conciliation and mediation function on a permanent basis in close coordination with the department of justice but

impossible to understand why he should have wished to bury himself in a remote part of a remote country observed the diary what purpose was he serving in leaving europe one thing he was not doingmaking any sacrifice for africa he himself has explained that he went to pay a debt which he thought europe owed to africa and in africa as he was being rowed up the ogowe river he found the answer to his quest for the continued from page ethical ethics was nothing else but reverence for life it is then his conscience rather than his patients schweitzer has been serving however valuable his medical services were in the days when they were the only ones today there is about the hospital something amateurish not only because of the doctors insistence that everything should be as elementary as possible but also because of his helpers many women from europe whom he has attracted although they may not be qualified so much for schweitzer
why television is a wasteland for negroes by dr william stuart nelson he subject upon which t i have been asked to speak is in my judgment appropriate and timely it cannot be said i believe that higher institutions of learning are playing their full and proper role in affecting the trend of world affairs and if this impression is correct it should be changed it is especially to be regretted if such a criticism can rightly be brought against the colleges here represented it is my thesis that our colleges must break any remaining bonds of insularity and launch into the mainstream of thought pronouncement and action in relation to world trends this view is based upon the conception that college years are years when our young men and women are being ushered out of adolescence into adulthood are seeking a whole view of human affairs and are preparing themselves to participate in the complete life let us concede that during college years much remains to be done in the shoring up process history and even life today have been unkind to many of our students and there remains the urgency of overcoming weaknesses in fundamentalsin reading writing and arithmetica task which the colleges will neglect at their peril this task the student must perform out of time and energy which youth not so shackled can employ in response to their personal tastes this obligation of remedying defects of earlier training must never be confused however with the true purpose of the college institutions of higher learning have among others two basic roles first to prepare their graduates for vocational and professional responsibilities and second to prepare them for their places as members of the larger society as responsible citizens of their country and of the world it is with this second obligation that i shall begin that is the obligation to educate for responsible citizenship we have not always been alert to this role the greeks placed a proper value on this responsibility indeed in greek cities where democracy prevailed those who did not participate in the life of the community were called idiots the kind of college we need today in relation to world trends is one that helps the student grasp the crucial facts about the modern world including the central importance to our lives of the nonwestern world it is disappointing to see the distinguished educator dr oliver c carmichael commend an arts curriculum which includes only the basic concepts of the graecoroman world together with the judeachristian history literature and philosophy the fact is that we are all at this moment tied irrevocably to the asian and african communities whose cultures are also ancient and rich no man can call himself educated or prepared to stand in judgment upon modem world trends unless he brings to that judgment some solid acquaintance for example with the ancient cultures of china of india of africa including their contributions to philosophy religion art science and government until a few years ago we were left to learn about this area of our world by sheer happenstance and then not in the schools our colleges which do not repair swiftly their weaknesses in this respect will fail their students perilously a second fact which the college student must grasp today is that he lives in a revolutionary world perhaps the most farreaching and significent period of social revolution in all history men speak of the eastwest struggle the confrontation of the communist and the free worldby subtle implication the slave and the free world what faces us however is a world revolution begun in russia against a czarist and ecclesiastical regime and continuing more recently in the form of an ineluctable nationalism sweeping across the horizons of south asia and africa especially striking is the fact that for centuries western european countries held in colonial bondage the people of a large part of the worlds surface the sun never set on the british empire during the past fifteen years this picture has changed one experience of my life shall never forget it is that of midnight on august when i witnessed in india the ceremony marking the passing of the ruling power from the hands of the british to those of three hundred and fifty million indians everyone will remember his excitement on the day ghana in became free and attest to his deep satisfaction as one after another of the african states moved from colonial to a selfgoverning status today wherever there is suppression there is also the spirit of revolt it may now be in the smouldering stage if however suppression continues there is a question only of the day and the hour when the will to be free will burst into flames a third fact in relation to world trends is the search by wise and deeply concerned men for the discovery of a moral and spiritual force equal to the problems of a one world and a revolutionary world scientific advance in the field of armaments has accentuated this search so eminent an american as james reston washington correspondent of the new york times has expressed his concern as follows for perhaps the first time in history reflective men have to grapple with the pacifist question can national interests and human values really be served by waging a war with atomic and hydrogen weapons the washington post in a recent editorial discussed the tragic possibility of the destruction by modern weaponry of the irreplaceable genetic material in the human race and declared that our thinking today must rise to a plane as far above that of the past as modem weapons are above the cave mans club that wise men are seeking a new solution to our world tensions and are turning their eyes in the direction of a moral and spiritual solution is encouraging the tragedy lies in the fact that a power equal to our unhappy state has long been available only to be praised and forthwith ignored i refer to the great principle of the universal ethic the meaning of which is that men are brothers children of one creator each possessing a likeness to his father god chief albert luthuli of south africa is a dramatic example of the cementing power of a spirit dedicated to the removal of human injustice by the activist though nonviolent pressures brought to bear courageously and persistently upon the consciences of the south african agents of a ruthless suppression sentenced to confinement in his native village chief luthuli was lifted into world eminence by his selection two years ago as the recipient of the nobel peace prize here is a happy illustration of the moral influence upon the world mind and conscience of a quality of thinking and acting which can lift us far above the present level of fear and conflict the picture of the college which i wish to see is one then which leads its students to comprehend these facts of life that our world is not a western world and an eastern world is but one world each portion of which is capable of enriching the life of the other that our world is in revolution and that no man can play his proper role without understanding this and acting in the light of that understanding and that in answer to the question as to where we shall find the power to redress the balance between the haves and the have nots the weak and the powerful we can look to the possibilities of a force lifted up in recent years for the world to see by such spirits as mahatma gandhi martin_luther_king and chief albert luthuli to the responsibility of guiding students in the interpretation of the major facts of our modern world the college has the duty of developing the spirit of objectivity in their interpretation to contribute constructively to the solution of world problems even in a small way men must be guided by a spirit divorced from blind hemispheric national and racial loyalties freed from servile political affiliation and committed to the employment of those forces available in man himself we live and teach today necessarily under some restriction there is a difference however between living on the frontier of ones restrictions on the one hand and on the other of living and acting well within those frontiers where the risks are minimum living on the frontier of course requires conviction and courage i emphasize this point of courage in our colleges for we as a people live at a juncture in history where great decisions are required of us we are a people who have suffered at the hands of power vested in the greedy the mean the morally perverse and the politically timid we are an emerging people the kind of people we are destined to become rests to a large degree on the kind of graduates we send into the world i am arguing here therefore that the kind of image our colleges present to the world should not be one of qualifying students for a prosaic ab or bs what i have in mind is not on merely the mastering the facts about our world about which i have spoken i am deeply concerned with the developing college generations which will be seized with the thirst for truth and the courage to speak and act upon it we as a people are on the threshold of political power which can prove determinative on a world basis let us hope that many of our college students of today will be the political leaders of tomorrow if for no reason other than that we have suffered so grievously at the hands of the political demagogue supporting his social and racial prejudices our colleges should be willing to pay the price it costs to develop a future generation of responsible honest free political leaders let us compare a mississippi in a james meredith situation under its present political leadership with that under the leadership of a future generation with the moral courage of the student editor at the university of mississippi who recently stood her ground and spoke the truth as she saw it in the presence of the harassments of her fellow students we have before us here two entirely different worlds i come now to the obligation of the college to prepare students for vocational and professional opportunities even obligations in relation to world affairs including those where the element of service is central fortunately the opportunities in this area are increasing several years ago the president of howard university and i were invited to discuss with officials of the department of state the means by which a greater number of qualified negro college graduates might be encouraged to take the foreign service examinations more recently i was visited by a department of state official on this same mission concern i know is being felt by our colleges and a careful search is being made for a solution to this problem with some regularity now we read or hear of significant appointments to positions in the foreign service which have included three on the ambassadorial level the peace corps presses for more applications from our colleges with the expressed possibility that peace corps experience may serve as a stepping stone to appointments in the foreign service attractive opportunities are also increasing in other than government service technical competence is being sought at an accelerated pace by private companies engaged in expanding developmental operations overseas such competence is now being sought in our own institutions unhappily the positions available in the educational institutions of newly independent countries are greater in number than can presently be filled by competently trained personnel among us as we all know there has been the dedicated achievement of education for negroes in assisting newly emerging freedmen to acquire those skills enabling them to use their freedom responsibly equally meritorious has been the effort of our colleges to equip their graduates with those professional skills with which to meet the demands of a highly restricted community it can be said that this education ad ministered and received under conditions with which we all are acquainted has been of such quality as to mark an heroic epoch in the higher education of negroes but the walls of restriction are being slowly broken down no longer is the professional and technical skill of the negro in demand alone within the confines of a restricted community his talents are being eagerly sought on a world scale this fact calls for a basic reexamination of our college curricula and a questioning of the continuing exclusive emphasis upon traditionalism we shall continue to train doctors lawyers ministers teachers with a thoroughness that will make them second to none at the same time we must be alert to the vastly increasing categories of skills and vocational opportunities which will be available to the graduates of the s little dreamed of a few years ago this means that for years to come given the realities within which we live there will be a large although decreasing need for our education to minister to special deficiencies in our students preparation it is to be hoped however that this special obligation will with impressive speed give way so that our curricula may be conceived on a basis sufficiently broad to meet the demands of a world where competence not color will be the overriding criterion in this new preparation for our students we must bear in mind the obligation to help them identify themselves intimately with the people they may be destined to serve and with their needs thus the wider opportunity beckons our problem is to answer it in quality and in quantity we here know the problems our college students face the sacrifices attendant upon getting to college and finishing the urgent need for proceeding upon professional preparation for getting to work parents are exhausted and need support marriage beckons or having already been entered upon cries for steady employment all this and more the hard fact of life however is that while the world may recognize our problems it cannot by any miracle solve them our past and the liabilities it has laid upon us are a part of the present with which we must deal nor do we wish that society lower its standards to suit our situation in short the burden is upon both to press for wider opportunities and to qualify for those presently at our door the call is for still more sacrifice to add to that of our already one hundred years of freedom for harder work than the average less play than the rule for sterner self discipline in brief the call is for the heroic and the colleges in my view are the places supremely to instill this ideal and to summon our youth to embrace it the boston story by james r phillips ate on the night of f t l december young negro folk singja er jack washington ii i was walking along a boston street minding his own business when suddenly two boston police officers stopped him and insisted that he submit to a search of his person the reason given they suspected he might be carrying tools to pry open parking meters they admitted that they had no reason to suspect him and so negro digest june washington a student at emerson college refused to submit to such an invasion of privacy according to a charge sworn out later by washington under oath the policemen brutally assaulted him he was badly banged up and the physical appearance of the two policemen substantiated their counter complaints that he had rendered quite a good account of himself before being subdued up until now it might sound like this is quite a setback for the cause of civil liberties for negroes but wait there is more almost immediately bostons highly influential republican news paperthe prestigious boston heraldblasted the boston police with a powerful lead editorial that proclaimed there is here the question of whether the police officers by their own unwitting admission violated washingtons constitutional right to be free from unreasonable search of his person the officers told the court that they needed to search washington to determine if he had meterbreaking tools in his pocket he did not but the abroadinthenight statute under which they stopped him for questioning does not authorize any such search for evidence nor could it constitutionally all searches are unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional unless they are made with a search warrant or incident to a lawful arrest the police had no warrant to search washington and he was not arrested until after he was searched and then for an offense other than that for which the search was conducted the assault charge was substituted later it is necessary that lawabiding citizens be able to go abroad at night without being subject to arbitrary search and even assault and battery let the trial board hearings on the policemens conduct proceed here is the kind of prompt community demand for the equal protection of negro civil_rights that is now becoming commonplace in boston and it is typical of the exciting new gains being registered by negroes in boston in recent weeks three other developments of major importance to negroes have unfolded in boston here they are item negro lawyer edward w brooke former chairman of the boston finance commission was elected to the powerful post of attorneygeneral of massachusetts the only republican to survive a democratic sweep led by the presidents brother the nowsenator teddy kennedy item negro rt rev john m burgess was consecrated suffragan bishop of the protestant episcopal diocese of massachusetts the first time a negro has been elevated to such an important position in a predominantly white protestant episcopal community he has vowed to work for greater social justice in racial matters item such negro leaders as mrs muriel snowden director of the famed freedom house were credited with having played a major planning role as the city revealed plans for a sweeping public and private renewal program in the heavily negropopulated roxbury district of boston these three rapidfire developments are actually quite consistent with bostons early traditions boston itself was created in by a large and wellfinanced expedition of nonconforming protestant dissenters from england the leaders of this group included some of englands richest and best educated men they founded harvard college almost immediately to make sure that the infant settlement would be guaranteed a steady supply of leaders to carry on their traditions the major concerns of these early settlers were housing religion and lawsironically the same three areas in which major breakthroughs have just come for negroes in boston the breakthroughs themselves merely reflect a rebirth of the progressive ideals brought to the new world by those early setlers bostons biggest export in its early days was its moral conscience but for many years yankee bostons old nonconformist and revolutionary traditions seemed to be buried under the customs of newcomers now a definite rebirth of the traditional boston spirit has occurred circumstantial evidence hints at the possibility that the negroes arriving from the south mostly as were the original settlers protestants seeking individual liberty and equal opportunity have contributed importantly to this renaissance in boston but whatever the cause it is a fact that the old spirit of liberty has been rekindled in what had become stuffy and conservative bostonso much so that boston newspapers radio stations and tv stations have begun using the phrase the new boston to describe the exciting new spirit now sweeping through the city it may be expected that this boston spiritwhich aims at lifting negroes up to full equality will spread and have national effects the most obvious place to look for national effects of the new boston spirit is in the federal government president kennedy who is himself a bostonian has already issued an executive order banning discrimination in certain federally aided housing it may be expected that he will seek more civil_rights legislation and it is likely that he will be far more successful in this now with bostons own congressman john mccormick as powerful speaker of the house than he might have been with speaker sam rayburn from segregationist texas but the boston spirit is hardly confined to government activity indeed the tradition of boston from the first nonconforming setlers through the revolution was sharply antibig government far more important is the subtle but decisive influence the citys spirit has on anyone who comes into contact with it private individuals moving into positions of leadership in nongovernment activities can do far more good through moral leadership than mere laws can do by themselves take for example rev martin_luther_king coming from georgia he studied at the divinity school of big private and protestantbacked boston university when he won his graduate degree a few years ago he went back down south he had been greatly influenced by his experiences in the new boston his work since then in organizing the first really successful negroled drive for equal rights in the south is widely known but less widely known is the role that bostons spiritual traditions played in shaping this man there will undoubtedly be many more cases of indirect influence by boston on todays accelerating drive towards equal rights for negroes in the nation as a whole as proof of this likelihood you need only consider these past examples of how major social and moral movements bom in traditionally nonconformist boston quickly spread to embrace the nation the old north christ episcopal church was established in boston this church later to be famous because two lanterns were hung in its tower to signal paul revere buried negroes together with whites in its underground vaults it was a bold move for its time showing as it did a belief in multiracial social equality defense attorney james otis jr stunned his feuow boston citizens as he proclaimed during a key testcase trial before the british admiralty court that all men are born with natural rights of libertyand that no king or parliament can legally take away these equal rights the implications of the speech were immediately apparent to all concerned carried to their logical conclusion such views would render illegal not only imperial restrictions on shipping but also slavery as well a free negro sailor named crispus attucks was shot down in cold blood by british troops in the boston massacre he was the first american to die in what history later showed was really the opening skirmish of our revolutionary war the massachusetts supreme court outlawed slavery because of the words in the states bill of rights which stated all men are born free and equal a new century dawned and the fever of reform suddenly swept boston again veterans of battles at lexington concord and bunker hill began agitating for the abolition of slavery their slogan became we fought for freedom of all men black as well as white crusading editor william lloyd garrison established a newspaper in boston devoted to prompting abolition mounting interest in this cause led to the formation of the first abolition society in boston in a year later spreading interest led to the formation of other societies and then a national abolition society flaming speeches against slavery began drawing large crowds to boston auditoriums a young whig lawyer from illinois abe lincoln by name visited boston and heard an evening of abolitionist speeches lincoln up till then a fencesitting moderate noted for his logic found his lifes emotional cause he was to be totally won over to the abolitionist movement later he joined the new republican party and his extreme views won him the label of black republican upon his election to the presidency southern states immediately began seceding from the union his civil war victory fulfilled bostons abolitionist cause following the civil war boston underwent a transformation after years of leadership in the cause of liberty it sank into a conservatism that at times bordered on being reactionary the onceprogressive yankees fighting to hold their power against rising tides of irish jewish and italian immigrants seemed to forget their proud heritage as guardians of americas most exciting traditionsnonconformity dissent revolution and abolition but then more recently a seeming miracle occurred an unspoken truce was declared in the battles between old yankee and new immigrant stock perhaps it was the pleas for social justice from the small but growing negro community but at any rate something pricked bostons conscience catholics protestants and jews began burying their antagonisms yankees irish italians jews chinese and negroes began joining together in seeking to build a new boston the newness was visible to the naked eye in the form of new buildings but even more significant was the newness not visible to the eye this was a new spiritan electric feeling that one could only sense crackling through the air now this new spiritreally a very old spirit come back home to boston againis bringing very real gains to negroes late in it was the election of attorneygeneral brooke the elevation of rt rev burgess and the announcement of coming major improvements in housing opportunities it may be expected that will see further significant gains and it is possibleeven probablethat negroes in boston will make more progress towards full equality in the next ten years than in the last hundred years put together new leaders are arising leaders in the tradition of james otis jr crispus attucks and william lloyd garrison there is bound to be opposition from some stubborn individuals just as there was a minority opposition in boston to such earlier movements as the revolution and abolition but history showsespecially the history of movements bora in bostonthat once a new spirit of liberty and justice is loose in a community it can never again be contained and it will ultimately triumph if the history of earlier bostonborn movements is any guide the recent major gains for negroes in boston presage total equality of opportunity for negroesfirst in boston and then in the nation as a whole forgotten by gerard f kenney h youre wearing two ties delightedly little fouryearold lillian toyed with the two ends of the visitors deep down inside the visitor felt a sharp twinge of pain strangely his eyes smarted for a moment it just wasnt possible to avoid the emotion that came with the realization that this lovely wideeyed youngster has yet to have the opportunity to enjoy such simple things as playing with her fathers necktie fingering his cufflinks listening to the tick of his watch across the hall a young nurse rushed into a room to pick up and cuddle chunky little monthold alfred her practiced eye had spotted little a starting to rock himself back and forth in his crib the usual preliminary when lonesome infants deprived of the real love they need are about to start hitting their heads against the side of their crib a few feet away at a tiny table and chairs three bright delightful youngsters about two to three years of age were having lunch the table presided over by even cuter fouryearold norma norma had volunteered to help the nurses by helping the youngsters eat their lunch her reward a feeling of importance of being neededand a lollypop these are just a few of the forgotten per cent these are just a few of the hundreds of infants in new york foundling hospital third avenue new york city they are but a tiny representation of the more than youngsters in homes and orphanges across the united statesyoungsters whose yesterdays todays and tomorrows hold little in the way of hope for them to achieve real contentment real happiness a real home life these in this nursery are some of the more than negro youngsters whose futures are in serious doubt today for somehow beyond all understanding in these days of great concern for equality individual liberty social welfare and human rights the plight of these children seems to have escaped the notice and concern of almost everyone except a compara tively small number of dedicated professional men and women and social workers true these untiring people try diligently desperatelyand succeed in a good measure to make institutional life substitute for the warmth and love that only a foster home can offer but equally true children even as the birds and animals of the woodsare given parents at birth parents to help them teach them develop them to love them until they are sufficiently strong to face the world around them this is simply a natural law how then can the staffs of the childrens institutions be expected to fulfill the parents roles why should these temporary guardians be left with the impossible problem of trying to be to these youngsters something they cannot never were intendedto be the real tragedy of these beautiful foundling infants and toddlers is the fact that specialists in the field of child care and placement have determined that unless these children are placed in private foster homes by the age of four they are almost certain to endure an institutional life until they reach legal age for the sad proven fact is that having lived an institutional life from birth a child older than four years of age has lived with institutional routines and constantly changing nursing shifts and social worker staffs for so long that he many times accepts the feeling that he doesnt belong to anyone that somehow he is different when this occurs he automatically defensively shuts out the world at large and placement in a foster home can produce an emotional shock which could have a profound effect upon the youngsters entire future life and thinking these facts may come as a surprise to some readers an even greater surprise may be this many people think the youngsters in institutions are there because no one wants to adopt them but the fact is of the institutional population of more than children only two per cent are available for adoption ninetyeight per cent of the children are not subject to adoption for some legal reason they are wholly dependent upon the authorities who help to shelter them their destinies until adulthood are almost drab and hopeless unless prospective foster parents come forth and open their hearts and their homes to the children walk into the immaculately clean bright cheerful nurseries of new york foundling hospital or any other childrens home or hospital look at the cherubic lovable fouryearolds like norma how great the tragedy that at their ripe old age time is running out for them time and the golden opportunity for a carefree child hood full of family friends sunshine and the many other vital necessities of childhood realize for a moment that these are just a few more names in the roster of the forgotten per cent lend a hand for a moment to help little threeyearold jack out of his snowsuit the nurse has just returned him after a minute walk in the world of roaring automobiles exciting street noises gaily dressed people romping neighborhood childrenthe world of young people with hopeful futures watch jack walk off as he tries to find a new interest which in the confines of the nursery can help him retain the excitement and pleasure of his short outing into the wonderful world outside everything that can be done is being done for these youngsters by skilled social workers nurses doctors psychologists and psychiatrists child welfare agencies and volunteers but nothing can be a substitute for the love the warmth the affection and understanding that children such as these can receive from foster mothers and foster fathers perhaps the most dramatic evidence of the great difference between the institution and the foster home comes as the sun sets and day turns to night stand at the end of the corridor in new york foundling hospital as the good sisters of charity and crisp warmhearted nurses tuck in for the night the tiny tenants of nursery f now listen a plaintiff cry comes from tommy in one corner of the nursery a whimper from little jeanie in another corner a sob from little marian in another section of the nursery the head nurse knows that these few little cries in the dimly lighted nursery can upset the rest of the youngsters and cause a babble of heartrending cries and sobbing she moves silently swiftly from one end of the corridor to the other flicking switches on machines strategically placed at each end what are the machines they are sonotone securitones what do they do they reproduce and amplify throughout the nursery the recorded sound of the beat of a mothers heart this then must suffice to put the children at ease this must substitute for the loving caress of a foster mothers hand must pacify as would a softly crooned mothers lullaby can it be that many tens of thousands of lovable youngsters like these face a life confinement to institutions is it possible that so many capable couples across the nation fail to realize the wealth the treasure the happiness and fulfillment that these infants and toddlers can bring into their home is it not the greatest of ironies that child welfare agencies across the nation search desperately day and night to find foster homes for these infants who offer so much and yet the authorities are forced to admit that the results of their efforts are disheartening the irony these agencies are offering to prospective foster parents to and sometimes more in monetary allowance for each youngster taken in plus medical care and clothing yet sadly sufficient numbers of prospective foster parents fail to come forward for every ounce of common sense and human feeling would dictate that prospective foster parents would outnumber the children many times over qualifications for foster parents are simple in essence the couple need be only normal compassionate human beings they need not have a college education nor a higher income than their neighbors whether or not they have children of their own is unimportant nor is age an important factor for information regarding foster parents or volunteer work with foundling agencies address

to perhaps a week by fletcher e dalton possibly in order to appease certain groups agencies and individuals the television networks have recently caused a rash of negro performers to be seen on our screens mainly on major programs at prime viewing hours these guests have been a welcome sight and on one or two dramatic shows have given praiseworthy accounts of themselves this trend cannot last however because the persons chosen have all been famous and prominent personalities whose major careers lie well outside the regular scope of television lena horne dorothy dandridge sammy davis jr ray charles leontyne price mahalia jackson nor can this type of appearance satisfy those who long for more representation of the negro in the areas of television that are less spectacular guest appearances on variety programs panel shows chitchat hoursfrequently at fantastic pricesmay be a good beginning but certainly not the final objective what is desired it seems to me is less representation at the showcase or entertainment level and more representation at what might be called for lack of a better term the functional levels of television its commercial and educational areas more regulars than itinerants is one way of stating the problem television has used to advantage lately albeit with some timidity the area in which itinerants can be of significant value that is the area of acting in the halfhour and hourlong dramatic series in these negro actors have appeared in roles of doctor nurse teacher social worker policeman soldier and sometimes merely as a decently dressed passerby the one drawback is the fact that almost without exception these bit parts are taken by outstanding negro actors and actresses whose previous achievements on stage and screen are head and shoulders above those of their tv colleagues what for instance is ossie davis doing in car where are you i am not familiar with statistics on the availability in this country of negro actors and actresses but i am sure they number more than the half dozen or so players we see tossed about from one network to another in the course of a year someone pointed out to me that we cannot have our cake and eat it too that either we must have walkon parts with dignity and silence or have major roles and be garrulous and obsequious a la beulah and amos and andy would that our indignation at remarks of this kind could be passed on to tv writers leaving this area which is solving its own problems with all deliberate speed i should like to suggest the use of the negro potential in the commercial and educational areas of television areas as yet untouched and unexplored perhaps because unsought by us here it must be made plain that i speak as an observer only with no inside knowledge of the complexities of television commercialism i am concerned with what i along with several million other people see or do not see daily on my television screen advertising the principle of separate but equal has long been a part of american advertising as the annals of several negro magazines can attest a partial list of the products which advertise in magazines supposedly reaching only the negro community yet which are major sponsors or advertisers on television follows beverages cocacola pepsicola pabst schlitz millers toothpastes crest ipana gleem cigarettes kent winston viceroy salem lucky strike chesterfield foods kraft pet milk nabisco sealtest campbells transportation greyhound goodyear firestone general motors ford beauty products helene curtis maybelline ponds the above list was compiled from one issue of a national negro magazine each product is a constant television advertiser it should be noted that only those products are mentioned whose television commercials are in decent if not in good taste which automatically excludes certain personal items which have lately run rampant on our screens and alcoholic beverages which of course are not allowed television advertising each of these products is promoted by a negro in the magazines the commercial is exactly the same as it appears on the screen except for the exclusion of whites and the inclusion of negroes i am sure that for an occasional commercial this principle could work as well on the inch screen as in magazines the negro market is increasing constantly at a rather rapid rate and the business world is quite aware of this a selective buying campaign directed against those commercials which are twofaced would bring tangible results quickly enough things need not come to that pass however since commercials lately pretend to be unrehearsed natural and as american as apple pie catching housewives at work ordinary laborers in moments of relaxation picnickers and other happy unsuspecting subjects negroes are as available for this sort of advertising as anybody else each company of any size and importance has several commercials which alternate certainly one or two of these could utilize a negro or negroes especially for such products as beverages cigarettes private cars telephones and the wide range of home products may they spare us from the general quality of detergent commercials however which has reached an alltime low speaking of detergent commercials there was once a product in which a negro promoted the qualities of her favorite laundry soap or starch or whatever she was discovered ironing as the commercial progressed however it became clear that she was ironing for miss somebody who never failed to congratulate her on how soft her sheets felt miss whoeveritwas could never get them that clean herself it goes without saying that this bit of objectionable advertising was soon withdrawn i advocate its reappearance with a new emphasis that the negro woman mrs is in her own home ironing her own laundry for the benefit of her own family like millions of housewives do daily the world over with or without a dog named siegfried news two of the three major television networks have recently hired one negro reporter each bully for them newscasting and interviewing are major functions of television for regular reporting of the news of the day the minute segments between and pm the nation expects and currently has certain permanent newscasters there is reason to desire the employment of a negro eventually to read off the headlines during the midmorning and midafternoon abbreviated news segments negro reporters are desperately needed where and when national and local events have made interviews with negro citizens necessary this is especially true in crises real or anticipated resulting from problems of desegregation north and south no doubt many of us are almost driven to despair when the typical white interviewer approaches one of our brave standard bearers and asks after momentary embarrassing hesitation were you put up to this by the naacp or in the case of students who have been attending colleges and universities with token integration who have been your best friends male or female students or the most mistaken and yet most insidious of all just what did you hope to gain by all this this is not responsible reporting and certainly does not get that rapport between interviewer and interviewee which is desirable there are in this country excellent negro researchers reporters photographers capable of handling with all ease and effectiveness documentaries of many types particularly those which deal with our own segment of the population we should press strongly for their employment and use by the major television networks there are other areas in this medium where the employment of negroes would be a national asset educational television is one it is strange that national educational television which does not have even that patched and constantly ravelling skirt of southern opposition which as they grow up the commercial networks seek to hide behind less and less utilizes the negro to such a small extent i have yet to see a negro instruct a class for credit via educational tv and yet what are we if not teachers national educational television the one medium in the nation best equipped to dispel the notion that the negro is not under the spell of the bad fairy and is condemned to sing and dance himself into oblivion is tacitly promoting that fiction in short then this vast wastelandincluding both its commercial and educational networks could use some of its neglected human potential to create oases designed for the mutual comfort and uplifting of us all toward a goal of full racial justice by the most rev lawrence j shehan dd catholic archbishop of baltimore md christ in the month of november the bishop of this country at their annual meeting issued a statement entitled discrimination and the christian conscience after noting the rather remarkable progress made by our negro fellow citizens particularly during and after the second world war toward such goals as political equality fair edcational and economic opportunities good housing without exploitation and a full chance for social advancement the bishops went on to say that in more recent years the issues have become confused and the march toward justice and equality has been slowed if not halted in some areas the transcendent moral issues have become obscured and possibly forgotten the heart of the race question they declared is moral and religious it concerns the rights of man and our attitude toward our fellow man if our attitude is governed by the great christian law of love of neighbor and respect for his rights then we can work out harmoniously the techniques for making legal educational economic and social adjustments but if our hearts are poisoned by hatred or even by indifference toward the welfare and rights of our fellow man then our nation faces a grave internal crisis within this household of the faith this temple holy to the lord this dwelling place of god in the spirit this mystical body of christ there can be no room for racial discrimination and the bitterness and rancor that inevitably grow out of it in this year when the minds and hearts of men are turning longingly and hopefully toward the goal of christian unity it is particularly important that justice and charity without any discrimination or prejudice or antipathy should shine brightly within the church of christ there is we knowand there can beonly one center of christian unity christ and his mystical body but how can that body be recognized for what it is unless there is within it unity without division or dissension and unless within and between its members there shine the justice and charity of christ within the time and space available to me in this letter it is impossible to set forth in detail the extent and the nobility of the duty of f justice and charity incumbent upon us as members of christs mystical body under the circumstances m of today however it may be useful if i attempt to state briefly the minimum that is required of us as members of christs church in this archdiocese there is i hope no need to say that in our churches and in our parochial life generally there must be not only no racial segregation but also no distinction of rank or place i or treatment based upon racial difi ference because we are members one of another do not grieve the holy spirit of god in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption ephesians for now the justice of god has been made manifest through faith in jesus christ upon all who believe for there is no distinction as all have sinned and need the glory of god romans in our schools both elementary and secondary the same general policy holds as catholic schools they are meant primarily although not exclusively for catholic studentsfor all catholic students insofar as facilities can be made availablewithout racial or any other discrimination this means that in the registration of students a common policy approved by our catholic school board must be followed in the case of all catholic children living within the boundaries of every parish fortunate enough to have its own school the same policy must govern all transfers from one school to another within the school identical academic standards must apply to all students and all must be treated with equal justice and charity in our diocesan organizations and institutions of charity a sincere effort has been made over a period of years to eliminate discrimination and to effect true integration longstanding social and cultural patterns have at times made this process difficult with the opening of the new st vincents home we believe that the last traces of discrimination in this field will have disappeared it is some months now since all our catholic hospitals gave formal approval and acceptance to the policies of nondiscrimination i specifically proposed this means that they have agreed to admit and treat applicants for medical and surgical service without distinction in their outpatient departments to follow the same procedure in admitting patients into the hospital and in assigning beds to them that there shall be no discrimination practiced in handling applications for membership on medical surgical and nursing staffs that advancement within each staff will be governed only by ability training experience and character that a policy of integration and nondiscrimination is to be effective for all employees of the hospital in older and outmoded hospital plants it has sometimes been difficult to eliminate some customs based on ageold prejudices and social patterns but now that the last of our hospitals is acquiring a modern building we are confident that the final traces of segregation and discrimination will disappear some of these policies have been in effect in each of these fields for a long time we do not claim that any of them go beyond mere justice i have spelled them out in some detail because of questions which have been raised from time to time the duty of justice and charity applies not only to our churches our schools our charitable organizations and institutions and our hospitals but also to all of us as individuals it must guide us in our personal relationshipswithin our block our neighborhood our community in our social and fraternal organizations in the business we may conduct in the labor unions to which we may belong at work and at play in all the circumstances of everyday life particularly lamentable is the unreasonable and automatic panic too often fanned by unscrupulous and disreputable real estate brokers and speculators which accompanies the arrival of a negro family in an area previously occupied by white families only the flight that occurs not only unfairly prejudges the new neighbors but it also works an economic hardship on departing property owners destroys the community undermines church life and hits hard at substantial investments made in schools rectories convents and recreational facilities as well as in the actual places of worship nor can we afford to overlook the crippling effect that division and dissension within our community have on our efforts to meet what is perhaps the most alarming problem of this and every other large city of the country crime this is not the place to go into the sources or causes of crime within our midst suffice it to say that no part or group of our people has a monopoly on those sources or causes what should concern us is that the problem is so great as to call for the best minds and the combined intense and persistent efforts of the ablest leaders of all elements within the community in saying this we reflect in no way on the police force of either city or state on the contrary we have complete confidence in the integrity and ability of both the heads and the ranks of our police departments but this problem is one that requires the continuing scrutiny and efforts of the community as a whole it will not be met adequately if there is dissension division suspicion between the two chief racial groups of our citizens even to enumerate our present duties and policies brings vividly to our minds our past defects those defects we frankly admit with humility and regret we catholics must acknowledge that we have been all too slow in the correction of our shortcomings although in the light of the experience of many of our forefathers we should have been particularly sensitive to the unjust inequalities suffered by other groups for this reason we have a special obligation to place ourselves in the forefront of movements to remove the injustices and discriminations which still remain we are all aware of the present grave social problems which have had their origin in racial prejudices and tensions and which are fed by longstanding racial antipathies these problems cannot be suddenly solved or wiped out by wishful thinking or good intentions they are community problems they therefore cannot be successfully met by any one part of the community nor any one group however highminded and earnest they call for the combined thought and planning and cooperation of all of us they require patience and understanding and good will and persistent effort on the part of everyone they call for a sense of justice above all in that part of the community in which the evil had its origin and a spirit of charity on both sides in their statement the bishops of this country while calling for concrete plans for the elimination of discrimination and the establishment of equal justice and opportunities urged that such plans be based upon prudence the virtue which inclines us to view problems in their proper perspective the problems we inherit today they noted are rooted in decades even centuries of custom and cultural patterns when we are confronted with complex and farreaching evils it is not a sign or weakness or timidity to weigh carefully the proposed remedies and reforms some changes are more necessary than others some may be easy to achieve others may seem impossible at a given time it is the mark of wisdom rather than of weakness to study problems fully and to form plans carefully prudence will indeed guard against the rashness which may endanger solid accomplishmentbut prudence must never serve as an excuse for inaction or unnecessary gradualism or as a reason for not holding a straight steady course toward our goal of full justice uncle tom abroad by julian mayfield difficult to recognize in africa than he is at home i refer here to the north american genus of the specieshomo tomo americanus this type of tom is u often a technician of some sort in africa on a two or three year contract on the payroll of the u s government or a private firm frequently he is a scholar or a writer who is merely passing through on a lecture or a study tour sponsored by the state department or one of the many wealthy foundations at home you can easily identify the average tom by the way he relates to the white world whether a day laborer college president clerk or scientist he has been convinced by the enormity and seeming indomitability of white power that he and his kind are indeed inferior beings prudence and common sense dictate to him that he should do everything he can to remain on good terms with the master race toms philosophy is dont rock the boat but to isolate the genus here in africa requires keen perception when he alights at the airport tom becomes first and foremost an american abroad with all that that implies he carries himself with a confidence unknown to him at home and he is always on important business he wishes to see the president or the prime minister immediately if he has traveled much he is on a first name basis with all the african leaders i told kwame that i thought he should jomo met me at the airport and we had a drink together julius asked me for my advice about how can one help but be impressed another thing that makes it difficult to identify homo tomo americanus in africa is that here he is always a radical back home you could probably not get his signature for a petition defending the right of women to have babies but once on african soil he becomes a vociferous advocate of socialism not even lowering his voice or looking over his shoulder one also detects in tom a vein of militancy he never displayed at home to listen to him talk at a party or over dinner one imagines that tom would if he had his way singlehandedly set to rout all the white settlers and drench the continent in their blood if someone is unkind enough to point out to tom that this is strange talk coming from someone who works for the u s embassy which means they must be certain that he is safe or that his tour is being financed by white foundation money tom laughs without the least hint of embarrassment he looks at you with pity and amusement in his eyes as if you are out of touch with what is going on back home among the really hep negroes of his group yes he says it is true that he is on their payroll but he is not with them he knows what those white soandsos are trying to do in africa and that they are trying to use him tom because of his black skin butand here tom usually winks at youhe is smarter than all of them the state department the u s intelligence services the foundations the african study groups etc tom actually believes or at least he wants you to believethat he is taking their money while at the same time he is helping to promote the african revolution but there is one certain way of identifying homo tomo americanus in africa he never does or says anything that might annoy the local u s embassy thus however militant he may sound in private he can never publicly give a straight answer to a simple question about american racialism at one of toms lectures for example if he is asked to comment on the spectacle of mr merediths rather noisy enrollment at ole miss tom replies yes it was shameful but the important thing is that meredith got in thats progress but he is asked why didnt president kennedy use the occasion to teach the morality of human equality to the nation instead of merely pleading with the white students to obey the law well you see says ambassador tom who values his passport highly who likes the idea of being an international traveler and who knows that there is always in the audience an agent from the local embassy recording everything he says mr kennedy has many problems and let me say right now that i think this administration is doing everything it can to eliminate discrimination poor tom for all of his apparent sophistication he lacks sensitivity he returns home now an expert on africa to write his articles and give lectures unaware that he has been the object of derision and contempt for most informed africans have no illusions about american racial problems even more regrettable is the fact that while traveling through this continent of revolt where millions of people are crawling stumbling and pushing forward toward a better life tom did not draw the obvious conclusion the conclusion that thousands of young black americans are reaching every day that the only way to make progress in a situation of oppression is to rock the boat and to rock it with such violence that either it sinks or it becomes a decent place in which to live and his world of a painter walter sanford has evolved through a periods marked by the unique energy and enthusiasm that the man brings to his work and to his life currently he is involved in what he terms a return to realism and the canvases being turned out in his chicago studio have the boldness and vigor associated with the great mexican painters david siqueiros and diego rivera the influence is at least partly a reflection of sanfords mexican period a time of his life he regards as having been both especially happy and productive most people who know sanford think of him as being quite a character and even the artist labels himself something of a clown but then he goes on to explain you can escape a lot of hardship by clowninglike bessie smith used to sing i laugh to keep from crying in any event sanford possesses an outlook and attitude as bold as his painting style and as winning it is instructive to talk to him and exciting to watch him work my art is as rough as funky jazz he says it reflects the tempo the beat of the times currently sanford is working on a series of portraits of real and imaginary figures with such titles as the politician the philosopher and the policeman they are notas one glance will indicate merely portraits but portraitsindepth baring the subjects souls in a whimsical moment sanford lured casey jones chicagos famed chicken man who prowls the city with a rooster that does everything but talk into the studio to pose casey claims to be among other things and capturing this innerman on canvas would challenge a michelangelo a native of chicago sanford grew up on the south side a far more romantic place then than it is today in grade school he came under the influence of a miss ryan who had him paint a landscape when he was nine the carter school teacher became his first booster sanford whose wife susan is a teacher says that teachers the philosopher is one of a series of sociological paintings on which sanford is working currently have always strongly influenced his life sanfords formal education ended with high school and his rather scanty formal art education included a year of three evenings a week at chicagos art institute and later a year under famed john carroll at detroits arts and crafts until the artists style was generally expressionistic then caught under the spell of picassos cubism he switched to abstractexpressionism he worked in this style primarily for some years during his sojourn in detroit las vegas mexico and france the return to realism was a step taken early in a year after he had established a new studio in the heart of chicagos near south side across the street from the prairie shoreslake meadows urban housing complex sanford crosses town from his home to his studio daily like any man with a job of work to do disdaining artistic affections he receives friends and customers all day entertains them while he works does all the visiting affect his mood and concentrationi am no beatnik artist sanford laughs i am a painter painting is my life and i can do it anywhere at if i have breath will be painting and there is no reason to doubt that he will sjn sjvnraisai by aral he is known as sanford when he was he sold his first painting this lucky event formed his future right then and there he made up his mind to become an artist and to be known as sanford his wife and close friends find even sanford too long and call him san the first halfcentury of his life proves that his early decision was correct today he who has no first name he who uses no middle name has indeed succeeded as sanford the artist sanford the american considers himself a world citizen he has lived and worked in many spots on the globeeurope mexico and all over the united states now after a year absence he has settled in his native chicago sanfords work proves that he grew with the age undoubtedly his creative talents and masterful techniques have directed him toward the expression of a unique style that is why it is not possible to press him into any specific school or pattern or ism to call sanford an expressionist or an unrealist or a surrealist is both right and wrong he is a mixture of all the established isms like his favorite painter picasso sanford can be judged only by his different periodseach of which reveals the influence of the physical and psychological landscape in which he lived and created take the las vegas nevada period for instance see how the sun the sand the cacti and the coloring of the mountains but certainly the bizarre shapes of deadwood have been transposed thanks to the artists genius blend into the color rhythm of his paintings this period seems to have been the most formative in the development of the artists style sanford must feel this way himself for only a single picture from this period is in his studio all the others are in his home and have never been offered for sale does this mean then that the true sanford is the one of the nevada desert periodit cannot be because there also is his taxco mexico period who ever has set foot on this hidden jewel of mexican beauty will never forget sanfords color symphony from the taxco period this is mexico old mexico and her people abstracted to the essentialsseen with the eyes of a great artist expressed in graphic forms keen composition and bright colors the question arises is this artist a painter specializing in oilsso rash a conclusion could not be more wrong sanfords creativeness is not limited to oils or to landscapes stilllifes or portraits there is sanford the master with the pencil who with a few lines records daily life there is sanford the satyr who with sharp mind and even sharper pen and india ink nails down some hypocritical conceit there is even the master of the linoleumcut and of the woodcut an almost forgotten art only recently did sanford carve his own image into tough oak there is even sanford the sculptor this artist is at ease and at home in so many fields of artistic expression artistic media and techniques that it is impossible to put the finger on the one true sanford yet having been privileged to watch the gradual development of one of his latest works from the conception in red into a finished masterpiece in blue let me talk for a moment about an oil study for which the artist selected the name the philosopher this painting reveals the maturity of a man who reaches beyond the stage of being a graphic artist painted without a model sanfordhimself a member of a minority group has created the head of a member of another minority group the image of a jewish dreamer who speaks with his divine master sanford has created a face that smiles as only those continued on page the wasted reservoir by hobart taylor jr t was one hundred years ago that abraham lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation this move essentially a wartime necessity represented one of the most unusual and daring steps taken in history people who had been regarded as chattelcommodities to be bought or sold on the open market like cotton molasses or rum were suddenly granted their freedom without preparation without adequate advance planning and without the agreement of that section of our country in which the most slaves were owned it was a revolutionary stroke which shook the foundations of our society it created problems both north and south it undoubtedly aided the union forces both in the united states and in americas relations with other nationswhich in the period when the british government had some disposition to intervene in the conflict was a crucial point furthermore it was a move that was morally right and it is a sad commentary that it took a war to place into effect an overriding moral principle the historical accounts differ as to how the slaves themselves greeted the emancipation proclamation the observers then on the scene were so caught up in the frenzied emotions of the bitterest war in our history that few of the contemporary accounts are reliable the romantic concept that the slaves by and large were happy people wellfed and pampered and did not want to leave old massa are obviously arrant nonsense the concept that the newfound freedom went to their heads and they became drunk with power is widespread but has been disputed by eminent historians no doubt the first reaction was one of great joy and an exultant mood of deliverance but the joy and the mood of deliverance must have faded quickly when the realization sank in that what the slaves had been granted was not freedomexcept in a legal sensebut the opportunity to march on the road to freedom if americans have learned anything in the last hundred years it is that the emancipation proclamation did not make men free what it really did was to remove some of the barriers that prevented men from striving to be free this point became apparent quickly when the negro tried to fit himself into the economic life of our country under a structure in which the base of all southern societyslaveryhad been removed he had no idea of what he was supposed to do or how he was supposed to do it he had no concept of wages or of the labormanagement relationship a few exceptional negroes had somehow managedeven before emancipationto establish themselves as successful businessmen but these were definitely exceptions and managerial skill was virtually missing from the negro community in some parts of the south slaves had been highly trained as skilled mechanics and semitechnicians but the great bulk were field handsmen and women who had nothing to offer but their ability to pick cotton and tobacco and harvest rice all the former slaves knew was that they were free and that there was a vague idea circulating that each family was entitled to acres and a mule the acres and a mule concept has frequently been cited as one of the most ridiculous proposals in our history we forget that at least it represented a programabout the only program that anyone had and if some effort had been made to put it into effect at least the former slaves would have had an economic base which would have permitted participation in our society lacking such a base there was little they could do other than to go on working for old massathis time on the basis of a wage relationship which they did not understand and without old massa being put to the inconvenience of investing capital in them the history of the pursuit of freedom over the last hundred years is in my view largely the narrative of efforts to find the necessary base as a general rule the question of freedom is discussed in dramatic terms such as the right to vote the right to equal justice under the law the right to education the right to free speech and the right to worship as we choose i agree that these are essentials of freedom but i do not think that any of these essentials can be maintained and preserved unless men and women have not only legal guarantees of their rights but the knowledge to take advantage of them and the independent economic position from which they can be exercised without those two essentials rights will exist only on paper we have not really done anything for people if we tell them that they have the right to compete for a a year job when they are precluded from receiving the training that qualifies them for that job we are not doing anything for people when we tell them that they have the right of free speech if their livelihood is entirely dependent upon one employer or a small group of employers we do not do anything for people when we tell them that they have equal rights before the law when they are ignorant of the pro cesses of the law or even of the measures by which a professional advocate can be secured these are the conditions under which negroes have labored for the hundred years since the emancipation proclamation to the extent to which these problems have been mastered freedom has become more of a reality and only a demagog will deny that even though we are far from attaining the goal of complete freedom enormous strides have been made in the century that has passed today i believe that we are on the threshold of one of the most enormous leaps forward that has been made in freedom for the negro in our history this possibility has been opened up by two factors which seem upon superficial examination to be entirely unrelated to the issue of freedom for minority groups those factors are the atomic age and the space age our nation is one which has never before known the true meaning of labor shortage there have been times and there have been places where productive workers could not be obtained when they were desperately needed but these situations were only temporary and affected only a small number of people in the past our manpower problems have been a question of a surplusnot a shortage we are still plagued by surpluses among workers on the lower level of skills the man whose knowledge extends to no instrument more sophisticated than a pick or the woman whose knowledge extends to an instrument no more sophisticated than a mop but in the higher levels of skills the shoe is already pinching and unless drastic steps are taken within the next few years the shortages could have a serious effect on our economic posture the great new industries that have sprung up around atomic energy electronics and the exploration of outer space gobble up trained minds like locusts attacking a wheat field in the huge space installations of the west coast thoughtful and sober men are already discussing the possibility of a time in the foreseeable future when the u s will have to ration brainpower and establish priorities to determine which scientists go to which projects there simply are not enough physicists chemists metallurgists mathematicians engineers and biologists to go around government administrators complain bitterly that young scientists upon whom they lean heavily are snatched up by private industry on the basis of salaries that the government can never match obviously we must find new sources to teachnew people who can be trained in the complex and highly sophisticated techniques that are required to maintain modern industry we can of course squeeze more scientists out of our present student populationbut not many more to find trained minds in the quantities that we need we are going to have to go to a reservoir which now is scarcely touchedthe million americans who are of negro descent i do not want to present this in any oversimplified form we do not have before us a quick and easy path to the millenium we are not going to have overnight the spectacle of laboratories suddenly being staffed with negro scientists we must be frank about it and admit to ourselves candidly that the negro scientists do not exist in such quantities the doors of opportunity are wide open but the negroes who would walk through these doors simply are not prepared to take advantage of this opportunity it will be necessary for us to break a pattern that has been building up for a century and which has become so rigid it can be shattered only by a major effort from negro leaders themselves traditionally the educated negro is a teacher a preacher or a dentist some become lawyers and a few become doctors and of course a number become undertakers or insurance executives it is not surprising that this is the pattern in these professions a negro can make a living out of his fellow negroes without ever touching white society at all he need not fear failure solely because of the color of his skin or his ancestry if he has the ability his success is assured but venturing outside of those professions leads him into a risky world where he must take his chances on attaining success on the basis of the whole societywhite and black for most of the hundred years that have gone by the sciences which now offer such golden opportunities have presented the negro with nothing but the prospect of failure why should a man or woman study physics or chemistry or mathematics when the only conceivable outcome will be a job in a mental capacity so our problem is a double one first we must convince our young people that the old patterns no longer prevail and that an education effort will yield rewards second we must work to see that that education is available and that the colleges which are attended by most negroes do have the necessary facilities that will train them in the skills and the professions of the present and the future my job as executive vice chairman of the equal employment opportunity committee has been enormously complicated by the lack of realistic training for negroes it is difficult enough to combat discrimination that is based upon bigotry or upon outmoded patterns of employment it is much more difficult to attack employment discrimination at its source not denial of the right to a job but denial of the right to train for a job when an industry does not em ploy negroes or other minority groups in certain skills the minority groups quickly lose interest in training therefore when the doors of opportunity are opened nobody is available to walk through them time after time i am told by leaders of large corporations that they are perfectly willing to employ negroesif they can find them in some instances this may well be a mere alibi but i believe that most of them are telling the truth industry needs brains and does not care about the color of those brains industry needs skills and does not care about the ancestry of the people possessing those skills but this process is not going to happen automatically it is going to take thought and care and planning and hard work on the part of negroes themselves i would hope that the organizations in the u s that represent negroes would devote themselves to this problem i would like to see our educators our leaders our businessmen come together to plan and to work to change the patterns of negro education and of the negro economy we are past the point where the negro economy can or should live apart from the white economy we are past the point where the only road to success for a negro is by making a living out of his fellow negroes the negro writer in america introductory remarks one of the things about being an artist is that you are produced by a people because they need you but the people who produce you do not want you this is not a complaint this is simply a statement of fact i suppose that the reason for this has to be something really bad and very mysterious that is that in the same way a human being a single human being wants to know who he is and wants to become himself or herself wants to live and read his or her proper name one day as it is and at the same time wishes to be safe and therefore accepts and adopts all kinds of disguises and begins to believe all kinds of lies in order to be safe in this safety this mystical or unreal safety he begins to perish this war is in everybody americans want to believe a great many things about themselves which are not true negroes want to believe a great many things about themselves which are not true too part of the dilemma i think of being an american negro is that the negro has been forced for a long long time in many many waysnot only physicallyto mantle himself on a society which always has been essentially incoherent that is to say one is mantling himself on someone who does not know who he is this means then that the imitatorand for the sake of argument you may say that all negroes in this country are imitatorsfinds himself in a very strange confusion and if the writer me jimmy baldwin in this particular case is trying to find out where the truth iswhere i begin and where society stopsto try to tell the truth about my mother or my brother or the porter or the negro bank president and try to find out how this relates to the american myth how it relates to the situation of young people in this countryblack and whitewho are lost in despair and bewildered looking for standards which dont seem to be present in the republic then you have a fantastic kind of confusion and the role of a writer in this country now i think is to begin to excavate almost for the first time the real history of this country not the history that one would like to believe about the founding fathers or the nobility of an abraham lincoln but to try to find out what really happened here what really got us where we are davis i am for better or worst a writer i became an actor not by accident but because i was advised by my professor in philosophy dr alain locke to become a writer when he found that i wanted to write plays and i had come from a little town in georgia called waycross and had never seen a theater he was interested to know how i was going to do it i hadnt given any thought to that part of it so his suggestion was to go become a part of the theater build sets sell tickets learn to act learn everything you can about the theater and eventually you will know what it is you are writing about and for whom you are writing in the terms of actors etc and because of his advice i find myself today from time to time having my long stretches of unemployment interrupted by a job my attitudes toward life have been formed in many places and over long stretches of time and im happy to say that some of the most constructive and generative of those formative people and ideas came from howard university from sterling brown from dr eugene holmes from many others my attitude toward life and toward art and toward writing and toward acting and toward my three children and all the other children in the world is primarily the same i can illustrate it briefly by quoting you a short poem of langston hughes which goes as follows my old mule got a grin on his face he been a mule so long he forgot about his race now im like that old mule black and dont give a damn you got to take me like i am you might think that this is a flippant approach to life and yet its not i have occasion to visit many of the public schools in new york city and in my own community because they are bemused by the idea that im a personage of some importance because i work on the stage and im too modest to disabuse them so when they send for me i go and i regret to inform you at this late date that i have yet to go into a public school in new york city where there was a negro principal i do not mean that the faculties of these schools are themselves vicious people i do not mean that they are themselves antinegro as a matter of fact they send for me and for my wife and for any other performer to prove to the negro child that there is somebody who in spite of his blackness represents a plus factor on the world scene but i submit that the morale of a small child is too delicate and too important an instrument to have this treatment administered adventitiously it has to be done deliberately i think that all public schools should be staffed by teachers of all races of all faiths of all creeds of all persuasions all kind of people so that a child not only sees himself reflected in the echelons of power but he also sees the world as it really is i think that the time has come when we in this country particularly the black man must hang his harp on the willow and refuse to play it unless he can give the truth about himself his people and the society in which we live killens i as a negro writer negro artist negro teacher negro worker ask america to listen to me i am your conscience get right with me and you will truly be beautiful before the world you will be the land you should have been but never have been yet a famous british writer once said many years ago that the important thing about a writer about an artist is out of how deep a life he speaks generally and specifically speaking what is my frame of reference simply stated i am a member of the human race male sex american more specifically i am john killens im a black man who was a black boy once who grew up in a georgia town who lived and cried and hated and fought and sang and laughed at being negro a boy who could not grow into manhood with the fullest implication of the word manhood being a dangerous pursuit in georgia or in mississippi as every freedom rider knows and every sitin student knows one of the problems i am faced with is that publishers want me to write about everything else but the negro publishers and producers from hollywood to madison avenue have said to me why do you always want to write about negroes why dont you just write about people negroes are the only people i know who are set apart because of who they are and at the same time told to forget it no one has demanded that tolstoy or certain other writers be so unspecific in their writings why this pressure on this writer to deny his roots to write about anything else but i think it is because the essence of the negro writers material is critical from the essence of his own being which is a criticism of society but i think that if america is going to get healthy it must listen to this criticism we may be the doctor america needs i write about the negro because this is my frame of reference my lifes experience but i also think that the most dynamic personality the most dramatic image in america today is the negro he is the protagonist personified by james meredith struggling with all his might his brain his great soul and his muscles to bring america out of the backwardness of white supremacy into the epoch of the colored people we live in an epoch where the disinherited for the first time in hundreds of years are in the fore england used to boast that the sun never set on the united kingdom look at the map the way it was years ago and youll see where the sun is setting now this poem by langston hughes sums up why i must write what i write youve taken my blues and gone you sing them on broadway you sing them in the hollywood bowl beautiful light and black our dreams by woodie king jr world is all aglow today and the day itself is beautiful the sun is shining across the street in the park young men and women are laughing and playing in the warm sun now and then pigeons flutter birds glide in and sing gay songs both birds and pigeons are drinking from the beautiful fountains here and there in the warm sun people are reading their free press today she as the sun will return after her long absence he is in the greek restaurant across from the park waiting and dreaming everyone is so full of dreams in the light and in the dark he is remembering her saying and he is thinking of her in light high above the city in a beautiful glass office smiling gleefully he is thinking that on that eleventh floor of that city building how full of dreams she really is aglow he is thinking this today he is sitting again at the same spot again waiting for her again this year he is fifteen minutes early he is remembering but whats your dream he wanted to ask her that last time when she sat across from him finishing her lunch but he did not not that moment but he wanted to he watched her face like poison exotic fruit dark grey eyes large and always on watch lips full and always in that positionthat position that caused him to know his heart could beat queenly the woman everyone wants the beauty parttime actress secretary six hours a day on the eleventh floor of the new city building only one of that beautiful color joanne watching her finish her lunch with a million dreams in that beautiful head beautiful joanne so serene one of the many women born negro yet are almost white inside and outside the kind of negro woman that has a million dreams of winning beauty contests in canada or being the first negro miss street railway then being spotted by stanley kramer or somebody anybody the light kind with the features of the caucasian the kind that all men seem to love because they are yet they are not and yet he is man it is not those things that made him care for her love her for him it goes farther to the time when he first saw her start at the beginning drift backwards travel in slow motion through other winters and summers through time that element that taught her you all the way back to the reason for her being across from you through other tears and laughter the beginning once there was a woman named joanne go on i saw her first on the floor of a little theatre reading her lines from a greek tragedy she and an irish fellow whom she loved oh how she loved him played there on that floor in that little white theatre so gay was her laughter so dry was his talking of their trip to palestine talking of blue grass in the beautiful highlands speaking like modjeska saying gee whiz eating pizza laughing getting excited playing wrestling i would watch her often i had to and i wondered why she never looked at me was it time they read their lines and i being dark and invisible to them chose to remain that way for in a world so white and light so strange i felt darkness was forbidden everything about the theatre was white she blended in i did not i could not often i would pass her sometimes she would look upnot at me but up then it changed we would be apart and our eyes would find each other her smiling ceased no words never never words never smiles strange the irish did not look up he looked down always when he was with her he came with indifference and with indifference did i receive him i dreamed one night that she would tell me i did not belong the dream occurred in a snowstorm far away in a place where the snow never seemed to cease its steady fall and i was lost in that snow desert unable to find my way then i saw her and the falling snow and she was in a sort of transparent nightgown i asked her if she was cold i wanted to protect her from the cold snow wanted her warm her mouth moved i could hear her voice in an echo resounding away away go away away then the dreamed changed i disappeared and a gigantic black man in chains sweat glistening on his back and face walked slowly towards her singing any day now and his presence made the snow melt made the sun shine made her smile and they danced to songs of leadbelly they danced until she became exhausted until belafonte sang until leadbelly cried i reappeared and the snow returned and the echo away away go away away i went away a long interval of dream filled days and nights the middle once there was a store downtown slowly i went in out of the cold white snow a feeling hit me something wonderful more wonderful than life itself in that store something as wonderful as the sudden return of summer after a snowfilled winter my body became fervent i looked for the cause throughout the large store it had to be there it was there i felt it up from the basement all through it until i saw that black and white checked coat far away descending i saw her i looked at her across the store she looked at me no words a smile i found her that winter morning and she saved my summers then we knew we had to know i returned winters and summers of tears and laughter searching the end the end yes life stops sometimes and in those times pain is the only substitute for me there have been many i believe this day will bring another he cares for her and loves her because time caused it time time that puts beginnings middles and endings to life and love still remembering she turned flashing glances through every face within the huge immaculate restaurant then out the large glass window facing circus park the church the institute of technology north and a city filled with pure white snow look at them she said see how they move they dont know where they are going none of them do they he smiled glad to be with her nodded his head agreeing look at that funny looking couple with the poodle he said finally they both laughed i know they are cold i just know it she said why do they pretend they are warm its freezing out there im hip he said but i cant really think of anything outside youre it today love you she said silence while they looked at each other he wanted to ask her have your dreams changed since the last ones he could notnot now they dont even know one of these days they are going to know who we are ay man he nodded and sipped the hot black coffee we are going to be famous man you and i she said but not as serious as it had been said in happier winters and summers and he thought he knew then yes we are going to be famous he said one of these days he looked at her long whats your dream now joanne labold my dream she said i want to get off the eleventh floor of that damned building i want to be somebody want things want so much she turned the spoon in the black coffee sometimes i look from my glass and i want to fly down and kiss my fate but there will have to be revolutions before my dream comes true and i cant wait that long look at me my face where do i belong whats my dream whats your dream am i your dream she looked at him long then out the window north will my dream end here joanne he placed his dark hand on her light face gently gently gently he moved her face opposite his and the black porters in white jackets and black ties gazed the white men in black suits glanced and all the white blonds all white white and starch sat rigid while the knives and forks and spoons tinkled and clashed but he could not hear them he in that moment of black agony heard only the soft white snow falling will my dream end again he repeated himself and the minute she took to answer seemed like an hour we have some time to talk she said he will meet me here in a short while she moved the dark hand away from her face slowly she held it tightly with both hands i wont be seeing you again honest but i love you i love you love you wont be seeing you again he knew then he felt it it was there all the turmoil before an erupting emotion all the rushing to the head of the inside of his soul leaving the boiling deep deep far away in the head then changing to hot tearstears that lingered within his hot burning eyes not coming out to be seen never coming out to be seen tears tears and he fought them he noticed her mouthugly nowmoving trying to say something not hearing her not wanting to he looked out the glass into the white white snow north at the cathedral at the bell that would chime then the te deums that for him would never mean glory after them he would be alone again without joanne again viduity again feeling like a single falling leaf late in the dawn again is this what he had feared her mouth moved i had to see you tell you the seconds of silence seemed like years what can i say hes very nice you will like him anyway you know him hes irish yes i know him he said his voice was a whisper i know she whispered she turned and looked out the glass and that day she remembered she is remembering saturday night sunday morning the end of summer we attended the play long days journey into night how beautiful oneill recreates the feeling of impending doom and i knew there would be a sense of doom in me that night for i had been searching in a strange black world and that world had refused me when i needed it most i wanted to destroy it by becoming a part of the white blending with the white the tragedy of nature he would call it had already told him i loved alexandras that he wanted to take me to paris and ireland and as i remember it was the first time we had ever really talked strange our first conversation had to be about someone white about what that someone wanted to do for me he was hurt because he did not want me to love alexandras did not want me to tell him what white could do for me he tried desperately not to show it i believe i convinced him that that love was a different love not like the feeling for him but i dont think i convinced him anyway he took me to see alexandras in the oneill play he took me to the afterparty he wanted me to be near alexandras it seemed we stayed at the party until four am i glanced at him often watched him moving through the white party dark and invisible to them he never looked at me i talked to alexandras all that time we exhausted ourselves talking about nothing and when we couldnt think of anything else to say we made a date for sunday night i did not tell him he knew we made the date at four am at four am he looked at me across the room through the white crowd sunday morning mourning far away the te deums we talked we kissed for the first time that sunday morning be tween darkness and dawn so gentle gently gently oh god how wonderful i felt i felt more love than dido must have felt and i fell in loves abyss for the first time everything around me was so strange the darkness and the dawn the sun and the night the coldness and the heat all together at the same time all my life i had been told and i felt that i should go beyond darkness and i could i could change with the seasons but everything about me changed when we caught the darkness and the dawn every little thing became a beautiful phallic symbol made me think of him dark and invisible melting the pretty pretty snow i know she said again you shouldnt have told him to meet you here he said we tried you know that tried he tried to say something else no words came even his lips felt heavy thick he prayed to be what she wanted but he knew he could never be lets talk about something else hows your family she looked at him long her eyes and pretty face expressionless everything about her serene as if she was at rest as if she was was inertia i wanted to tell you how it came about i wanted you to understand i understand he said but do you understand dont make me cry she said this had to be do you understand he said louder bitter the black porters in white jackets and black ties turned the blond people all white and starch showed signs of life and he was slowly dying again all my life she said i have had to protect myself be on guard from what he shouted the pimps hustlers lesbians and others trying to misuse me she paused rubbed his hand continued without looking at him i look unusual go on what else he asked more than anything else it is the negro man i am negro man he said and i never attempted to misuse you how could i know that tell me how could i have known how could i be sure you were real i always guess at what you are feeling never knowing where you are never he looked at a white blond snow white crisp are you listening yes the seconds seemed like hours and man i have been misused she lit a cigarette some tell me of movie contracts and i say well miss labold this is it i spend weeks sometimes months making sure disillusioned some tell me they can make me a star in the ebony fashion fairs or put me on the cover or in the center of jet magazine always it seemed like the break my chance some seem truthful and god knows i try i try to find out but its always the same to them i am an illusion they want that day and night dreamme but they dont want the real me they dont want the me that breathes cries wakes up in the morning goes to the bathroom men dont want me they want an illusion joanne he tried to say something please listen please she continued it made me feel like half a woman not complete in the way i want to be complete long ago iarbas i think i discoveredand it may sound funny as hellmen are spiritually weak they believe in god and nature she smiled you too man you too joanne he said you are trying to get outside your world the irish one is not for you he will never be he cannot be nature and god forbid it dont you see dont you understand they could find nothing to say for a long time just as nature and god forbid snow to fall twelve months of the year summer must return you are my summers joanne and if you are leaving because of disillusions feeling i think you are an illusion you will return like summer so full of dreams she said love you in light and darkness i think maybe yes she said the seconds lingered dont leave me joanne he whispered dont take it away i can never be complete with you bridge people i cannot make your dream come true i am human dont you know you will return again dont you know you cannothe cannottake away what is mine by birth you are mine i know it he knows it you know it mine mine mine i love you i love you i love you i love you iarbas i love dont joanne he remembered saying the bell in the church rang onetwothreefour his heart must have skipped a beat he felt his chest once looked out the glass hearing the bell sounding in his ears feeling his heart hitting his chest feeling his mouth becoming dry still looking out the glass looking for that facelooking searching for that face that would blend with the snow and she flashing glances as if really frightened regaining her composure putting on her lipstick or looking at herself in her small mirror and he still looking out into the snow hearing the bell hoping it would cease then both looking out the glass both seeing alexandras approaching from the far end of the park approaching dressed in a black top coat and sitting there he could not hear chains dragging from afar and he could not hear him singing any day now but he could hear music from the psaltery and the music sounded so beautiful in that glen of blue grass in the highlands far away where he could never be but where she might go and leave him forever and she could dance her dance to the music of the psaltery she could play in the bue grass of the high places as she played on that floor in that little theatre long ago she could stop and listen to the bell the bell the bell onetwothree the te deums bongbongbongbongi love youbonglove youbonglovebongyoubong bong alexandros approaching with indifference she rose looked at him see you see you alexandros there she smiling up to him and with indifference did i receive him both leaving he is alone both crossing the snow filled park her checked black and white coats collar turned up he holding her arm going north and she speaking something to alexandros he still sitting in the restaurant watching her ugly back watching the tracks of her black overshoes sink deeper and deeper into the pretty pretty snow watching and hoping hearing her voice see you see you wishing he could be what she wanted he turns and looks into the sun filled park at the couples laughing at the birds and pigeons that lounge and linger there at the beautiful water fountains that emit all colors of waterswaters that spring so misty and settle so clear at the cut green grass so green that it appears blue and the feeling he holds at this moment should be a bequeathal to the world it is everymans he sees her she is running towards him calling his name he stands he smiles she waves and watching her he is thinking that winters cannot last forever but he is also thinking that neither can the warm summers there are so many things that nature and god forbid the flowering of africas seeds by e l lasebikan s a result of the impora v tation of african j slaves into brazil many years ago and their subsequent emancipation and absorption into brazilian society several seeds of the african way of life were sown into the field of brazilian culture of these seeds some sprang up immediately grew into lovely trees and are bearing fruit today especially in bahia where the majority of the population is of african descent to mention three examples only we have first the candomble the religious cult of african origin which commands a formidable following comprising brazilians and foreigners of all races and classes and which in its regalia and decorations has lent scope for a magnificent display of brazilian taste for art and beauty then we have as a direct offshoot of the candomble african religious songs drumrhythms and dancemovements which have been handed down from one generation to another by oral tradition and are kept alive by constant practice at the religious ceremonies espe daily in bahia and thirdly we have food items of african origin such as acaraje vatapa caruru and so on which are relished by many brazilians irrespective of their race of class there is no doubt that many of the seeds sown did perish without ever sprouting into life but it appears that a number of the seeds have remained latent through the years and are waiting to be helped to germinate the move recently made by the university of bahia in inaugurating a course in yoruba language and culture at its centre of afrooriental studies seems to have produced the immediate effect of quickly germinating some of these dormant seeds in addition it holds the promise of being the means by which many more of the dormant seeds will be brought to life and many more fresh seeds introduced among the seeds that have been helped to grow through the inauguration of the course in yoruba language and culture three may be mentioned namely the use of yoruba as a means of communication the wearing of yoruba dress at social functions and the introduction of ayo the formost of yoruba indoor games already most of the second year yoruba students at the centre take pride in greeting each other in yoruba and in holding conversations in the language to the extent of the vocabulary at their disposal a number of the students have also secured pen friends in nigeria and carry on correspondence with them in yoruba though not entirely without occasional assistance and there is no doubt that as the students vocabulary increases and their technique improves they will be able to make more and more use of the language yoruba dress was worn in public by brazilians for the first time on the th of october when the yoruba class staged the play oduduwa ati awon qmo re at the theatre school in the university of bahia on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence of nigeria on that occasion the men turned up in their agbada and fila labankada and the women in their gele and iborun but since then the agbada the gila the gele and the iborun have been worn by bahians several times at social functions on the th of january the sociedade beneficente sao jorge do engenho velho threw a party at casa branca in honour of the fifteen students from different countries of africa who recently arrived in bahia on scholarships awarded by the government of brazil at that social gathering that sunday afternoon the agbada was conspicuously in evidence and it is significant to note that one of the newlyarrived students was wearing a nigeriansewn agbada and the president of the society sr antonio agnelo pereholes in their respective homes with the seeds they have won the player who succeeds in filling up is the winner and he or she wins by the number of seeds left over in the case of both players succeeding in filling up the game is a draw h the winner of one game plays first in the next after a drawn game either of the two opponents may play first i to know the decisive winner it is customary to play a set of three or even seven games the ayo game has only been introduced into the yoruba classes quite recently arrangements for the construction of the first ayo board was placed in the hands of sr antonio jacintho one of the second year students who got a carpenter to make the board from the dimensions supplied and the picture from the cover of alawiye book iii one of the yoruba books prescribed for the course as we are unable to obtain the real ayo seeds in bahia we are improvising with certain beads with a skyblue colour known as contas de louca they are a little smaller than ayo seeds but they are serving the purpose quite well the ayo game is becoming popular among the yoruba students already a number of opon ayo have been ordered by individual students for their homes jacintho later presented me with a copy of the late manoel querinos book entitled a raca africana and called my attention to the bit on page of what the author called aiu and was probably the same as the newly introduced game ayo i discovered that it was the following is what manoel quertino wrote about the game nas horas de descanso entretinhamse a jogar o aiu que consistia num pedaco de tabua com doze partes concavas onde colocavam e retiravam os aius pequenos frutos cor de chumbo originarios da africa e de forte consistencia entretinhamse largo tempo nessa distracao and here is a free translation of it in leisure hours they amuse themselves by playing the aiu which consisted of a block of wood with twelve hollowed parts where they place and remove the aius small fruits of the colour of lead which originated from africa and are of hard structure they amuse themselves for a long time with this pastime later investigation revealed that the ayo game was indeed known in bahia many years ago but that it has now disappeared why a game so popular among the yorubas and by nature so captivating should have died out completely in bahia i still have not been able to find out the ayo game is perhaps one of the seeds of the african way of life which sprang up immediately but later perished without growing to maturity to try and discover why and how it perished might constitute a useful piece of investigation but the more important thing is that a fresh seed of the ayo the foremost of yoruba indoor games has now been sown at the centre of afrooriental studies in the university of bahia brazilian culture appears to me as a culture of cultures constantly being further enriched by the development of the various aspects of the original cultures of the ethnic groups that go to make the brazilian nation the systematic study of african languages and cultures has only just started and is bound to increase and develop as time goes on when therefore in the process of time more of the dormant seeds of the african way of life have been awakened and many more fresh seeds have been sown what an array of lovely trees will be added to the field of brazilian culture what a further enrichment will be made of a culture of cultures is the white southener really inferior by gerald walker ome of my best friends are white southerners and i regret f beyond words the necessity for raising questions which may sorely vex them yet the white southerner problem will never be solved if we continue to gloss over certain hard facts out of a shortsighted desire to spare a minority groups feelings theyas well as we white northernerswill be far better off if at last these troublesome matters are discussed openly personally i feel only the greatest affection and respect for the white southerner in his place the trouble is however that lately the white southerner has shown all too little awareness of what and where his proper place is i refer of course to his precipitous turning away from his traditional agrarian way of life and his rather pushy efforts in recent years to attract new industry below the masondixon line now generally speaking it is certainly commendable for a backward region to try to raise itself but i must add in all candor that the impatient not to say aggressive manner in which a handful of white southerner agitators has gone about this task has sown the seeds of suspicion and competition between our two regions where previously there had been only harmony and understanding indeed interregional relations have deteriorated badly moreover my concern goes far beyond the somewhat narrow consideration that a number of white northerners have already lost their jobs as a result of their factories closing and moving south rather it seems to me that the real point is that perhaps it is time for the rest of the country to ask is the white southerner really ready for progress is he trying to come too far too fast after all the white southerner is but one hundred years removed from practicing slavery and while admittedly he had made rapid strides and come a long way since losing the civil war to an adversary battleproved to be his superior has he yet earned the right of full participation in the industrialized mainstream of contemporary american life would it not be better for all concerned for the white northerner to continue his stewardship of the south until such a time as there was not a shred of a doubt of the white southerners capacity to fend for himself for the plain fact of the matter is that there are vast areas of difference between the white southerner and the white northerner these differencesin morality in criminality in temperament in mentality in ambition and generally in the ability to adapt to the ways of western civilizationfirst became apparent to me when i was a carpetbagging freshman at the university of georgia in at that time though i was still naive and inexperienced enough unquestioningly to accept the prevailing theory that regional differences stemmed from socioeconomic conditions since then as a result of a number of return trips to the south while researching magazine articles i have gotten to know the white southerner well i have lived in close proximity to these people for extended periods visited their homes broken bread with them observed their customs and gone to their social functions making due allowance for the white southerners good qualitieshumor hospitality charm chattinessi soon came to realize that he was in fact a totally different and essentially inferior breed when measured against his neighbor the white northerner more than that it also became obvious that the socioeconomic conditions which i had at first mistaken for determining factors were merely symptoms of some deeprooted congenital flaw in the white southerners fundamental nature these firsthand observations on my part have lately been substantiated by the impartial findings of modern science as set forth most effectively by carleton putnam in his eyeopening work race and reason mr putnam whose extensive background as an airlines executive led him directly into becoming a noted amateur authority in the fields of anthropology biology psychology and anatomy is primarily concerned with demonstrating the innate hereditary factors which account for the observable inferiority of the average negro to the average white some indication of the brilliance with which he succeeded may be gathered from the wide circulationover copies soldand enthusiastic reception that his book has enjoyed in southern states since its publication in for example mississippi governor ross barnett proclaimed october as race and reason day capped by a aplate dinner in putnams honor and the louisiana state legislature passed a resolution that same year ordering high schools throughout the state to assign the book for study to selected mature students needless to say valid scientific principles and procedures are applicable to more than one set of data and circumstances thus a yardstick may be used to measure the length of an eel as well as a snake and so it is only further proof of the ingeniousness and usefulness of the anthropological and cultural criteria developed by mr putnam and his school if i now employ them in a painstaking scientific comparison of the average white southerner and the average white northerner as mr putnam and similarly objective researchers might say let the chips fall where they may it is only the truth that we are after this specialized field is still too new for there to have been much extensive research yet on the comparative skull sizes and brain weights of white southerners as opposed to white northerners however there has been some very good work done in connection with the well known innate defect in the white southerners jawbone and larynx by which he is prevented from speaking the english language properly according to professor w a emerson research director of the nonprofit curtis foundations center for higher learning and himself a white southerner the ws jawbone averages centimeters more in length than that of the typical wn specimen other investigators building upon this discovery have found that this additional length narrows the throat cavity signally constricting the larynx and causing the congenital speech abnormality popularly known as a southern accent in addition particularly in the case of ws females and political figures it seems to produce the peculiar effect of preventing the speaker from cutting off the flow of words until at least the better part of an hour has passed i needless to say no individual ws can be held personally accountable for the current state of his particular set of genes which is the result of several centuries of inbreeding of regional stock that was poor to begin i with but let us lay aside any inference of blame the point is simply that genetic facts are genetic facts and they must be taken into consideration when discussing the ramifications of inherent regional differences along these lines it is of the highest significance that not one of americas first five astronauts was a ws shepard was bom in new hampshire grissom in indiana glenn in ohio camenter in colo rado and schirra in new jersey in short when the national aeronautics and space administration was i given every resource to comb this country for the cream of american manhood the ws was deliberately bypassed in favor of the wn said an air force general at the time project mercury began what were looking for is a group of ordinary supermen nasa either did not look in dixie or if it did none were found but the ws has never been much of a supermannot even an ordinary one as far back as the hon j h lumpkin of georgia referred to our poor degraded halffed halfclothed and ignorant population without sabbath schools or any other kind of instruction mental or moral or without any just appreciation of character frederick law olmstead the distinguished thcentury wn landscape architect traveled throughout the entire old south and in in the cotton kingdom he reported on his interviews with ws men in their own homes and across their own tables the proportion of the free white men olmstead wrote who live as well in any respect as our working classes in the north on an average is small and the citizens of the cotton states as a whole are poor they work little and that little badly they earn little they sell little they buy little and they have littlevery littleof the common comforts and consolations of civilized life their destitution is not material only it is intellectual and it is moral i know not what virtues they have that rude men everywhere have not but those which are commonly attributed to them i am sure that they lack they are not generous or hospitable and to be plain i must say that their talk is not the talk of even courageous men elsewhere they boast and lack selfrestraint yet when not excited are habitually reserved and guarded in expressions of opinion very much like cowardly men elsewhere doubtless the ws will attempt to discount olmsteads careful observations as the biased judgment of a yankee but it is impossible to explain away a strikingly similar description penned by hinton rowan helper a ws born in north carolina in in his book the impending crisis poverty ignorance and superstitionmind you this is helper talking about his fellowwssare the three leading characteristics of the nonslaveholding white of the south many of them grow up to the age of maturity and pass through life without ever owning as much as five dollars at any one time thousands of them die at an advanced age as ignorant of the common alphabet as if it had never been invented all are more or less impressed with a belief in witches ghosts and supernatural signs few are exempt from habits of sensuality and intemperance none have anything like adequate ideas of the duties which they owe either to their god to themselves or to their fellowmen pitiable indeed in the fullest sense of the term is their condition some might object that this is hardly a balanced portrait of ws society or representative ws types what about they might interject the southern aristocrat arent we distorting things by not including him since he embodies the finest flowering of dixies plantation civilization here then is what historian henry adams had to say in his autobiographical the education of henry adams about rooney lee son of robert e lee and the other young southern bourbons whom he knew at harvard from to tall largely built handsome genial noted adams with liberal virginia openness toward all he liked he roony lee had also the virginian habit of command for a year at least was the most popular and prominent man in his class but then seemed slowly to drop into the background the habit of command was not enough and the virginian had little else he was simple beyond analysis so simple that even the simple new england student could not realize him no one knew enough to know how ignorant he was how childlike how helpless as an animal the southerner seemed to have every advantage but even as an animal he steadily lost ground strictly the southerner had no mind he had temperament he was not a scholar he had no intellectual training he could not analyze an idea and he could not even conceive of admitting two so much for the old south what of the newthe industrialized south prematurely announced in by atlanta newspaper editor henry w grady industrialization never fully took but it went far enough for the incisive ws historian w j cash to include a memorable wordpicture in the mind of the south according to cash by the cottonmill worker was a pretty distinct physical type in the south a type in some respects perhaps inferior to even that of the old poor white which in general had been his to begin with a deadwhite skin a sunken chest and stooping shoulders were the earmarks of the breed chinless faces microcephalic foreheads rabbit teeth goggling deadfish eyes rickety limbs and stunted bodies aboundedover and beyond the limit of their prevalence in the countryside the women were characteristically stringyhaired and limp of breast at twenty and shrunken hags at thirty or forty and the incidence of tuberculosis of insanity and epilepsy and above all of pellagra the curious vitamindeficiency disease which is nearly peculiar to the south was increasing this is not the snopeshaunted fiction of a faulkner pursued by a vision of rapacious termitelike subhumans taking over the south these are the words of a ws historian a man who deals in facts not horrific fables the same set of facts underlies erskine caldwells recollection of the countryside in his native georgia around within a few miles from town he remembered families on tenant farms were huddled around fireplaces in drafty hovels most of them were despondent some were hungry as usual others were ill and without medical attention food and clothing were scarce and in some instances nonexistent jobs were rarely to be found i could not become accustomed to the sight of childrens stomachs bloated from hunger and seeing the ill and aged too weak to walk to the fields to search for something to eat thomas wolfe another literary ws has testified to his fellows hostile and murderous intrenchment against all new life their cheap mythology their legend of the charm of their manners the aristocratic culture of their lives the quaint sweetness of their drawl perhaps most disturbing to wolfe was the familiar rationalizing and selfdefense of southern fear and southern failure its inability to meet or to adjust itself to the conditions strifes and ardors of a modem life its old sick appomattoxlike retreat into the shades of folly and delusion of florid legend and defensive casuitry and finally wolfe remarks of his autobiographical character george webber he was a southerner and he knew that there was something wounded in the south he knew that there was something twisted dark and full of pain which southerners have known all their livessomething rooted in their souls beyond all contradiction what is this something wolfe refers to it is that basic flaw of character which made the south the only section of the new young america to indulge on a large scale in the savage practice of slavery the first slaves were brought to virginia in exactly years later alexis de tocqueville sent to the united states by the french government noted how slavery had affected the ws in the intervening time in democracy in america de tocqueville pointed out that to begin with the settlers of the american colonies all belonged to the same european race had the same habits the same civilization the same laws and their shades of difference were extremely slight having begun on an equal footing the scales of character and affluence soon tilted sharply in favor of the nonslaveholding wn to the ws labor is confounded with the idea of slavery while to the wn it is identified with that of prosperity and improvement on the one side it is degraded on the other it is honored thus the men whose task it is to cultivate the rich soil of kentucky are ignorant and apathetic while those who are active and enlightened either do nothing or pass over into ohio where they may work without shame thus slavery prevents the whites not only from becoming opulent but even from desiring to become so this same influence equally extends to their manners in the south there are no families so poor as not to have slaves the citizen of the southern states becomes a sort of domestic dictator from infancy his education tends then to give him the character of a haughty and hasty man irascible violent ardent in his desires impatient of obstacles but easily discouraged if he cannot succeed upon his first attempt wss have neither traditions family feelings nor the force of example to check their excesses the authority of the laws is feeble among them that of morality is still weaker the settlers who are constantly peopling the valley of the mississippi are then in every respect inferior to the americans who inhabit the older parts of the union today three and a half centuries and a dozen generations after the inception of slaverys ill effects upon the ws it is small wonder that the biological law of natural selection should have worked some significant genetic changes the net result being that many of the above ws traits are today hereditary of course it may be objected that what we have just presented are but isolated impressions albeit perceptive ones based on careful observation and investigation what is needed it might be said is largescale objective uptodate evidence concerning the physical and mental makeup of the ws for precisely this sort of data let us now examine some highly revealing selective service statistics from world wars i and ii in army psychologists devised what they called the beta intelligence test to which inductees were subjected a leading segregationist intellectual spokesman richmond news leader editor james jackson kilpatrick cited a sampling of the beta test results in his recent book the southern case for school segregation even the figures selected by him show the ws running a poor second to the wn as can be seen from the following white southerners and white northerners army intelligence tests ws wn state median score state median score mississippi pennsylvania kentucky new york arkansas illinois georgia ohio oddly enough although mr kilpatrick used a similar differential between white southerners and negro southerners as the basis for arguing the latters inferiority and for justifying segregation he did not feel logically impelled to draw the same conclusions about the ws in relation to the wn this is a contemporary example of the wss inability to conceive of admitting two ideas at once first pointed out by henry adams a century ago in the three and a half decades between world wars i and ii the wsthanks to prodigious efforts by the federal government and private foundationsexperienced notable increases in educational cultural economic health and social opportunities surely it might be supposed these gains would have been reflected in some significant improvement in his showing when tested for military service no such improvement can be discerned during world war ii the selective service system divided the country into four regions region i the north region ii the midwest region iii the far west and region iv the south for present purposes let us limit our comparisons to region i consisting of maine new hampshire vermont massachusetts connecticut rhode island maryland delaware pennsylvania new jersey new york and region iv arkansas oklahoma texas florida virginia north carolina south carolina kentucky georgia tennessee alabama mississippi louisiana general service acceptance rates and disqualification rates per white registrants from november to december were region i the north accepted for general service disqualified region iv the south accepted for general service disqualified the difference between the sum of acceptances and rejections and the total of is accounted for by the men admitted for limited service during the above period the acceptance rate of ws males was not only lower than that of wn males of region i but was lower than of wn males in the other two regions as well region ii the midwest accepted disqualified region iii the far west accepted disqualified nor did the relative discrepancy between acceptance and rejection rates for wns and wss change later in the war from january to december the figures were region i the north accepted disqualified region iv the south accepted disqualified illuminating also are the statistics showing the prevalence of certain specific defects per white registrants from november to december region i the north syphilis gonorrhea and other venereal diseases educational and mental deficiency region iv the south syphilis gonorrhea etc educational and mental deficiency infant mortality rates are another index of living conditions and the populations hardiness in a given region expressed as a rate per live white births latest government figures show new england wn middle atlantic wn south atlantic ws east south central ws west south central ws the wss poor showing physically and mentally is matched only by his moral deficiencies and criminal inclinations reported john gunther in inside u s a the kind of piquant sociological detail known to readers of william faulkner still crops up in the news from day to day while i was in atlanta the papers printed a handsome little story about nine sisters all of whom were prostitutes in the same room lillian smith the author of strange fruit told me in clayton georgia of a recent case in which a baby died the parents left it on the bed to rot they were not rendered helpless by grief they made no effort to bury the body because they simply didnt know any better promiscuity and illegitimacy run per cent higher among wss than among wns the u s national vital statistics division reports that for out of every live ws births took place out of wedlock the comparable figure for wns was a mere another way of putting this is to state the white illegitimacy rate as a percentage of total white births a set of figures introduced on the floor of the house of representatives on march by mississippi congressmen john bell williams shows the following ws illegitmate births average per cent of total ws births but only per cent for wns in that same speech ws rep williams let slip another set of figures pointing up the higher rate of crime among wss compared with wns the figures revealed that in the northern states cited by rep williams the rate of wn felony prisoners then in jail came to per wn population but in the southern states he selected the ws rate was per in particular crimes of violence are an old southern custom charlotte n c was once known as the murder capital of america writing in ws historian w j cash said long before hatred for the black man had begun to play any direct part in the pattern of more than three hundred persons said to have been hanged or burned by mobs in the south between and less than ten per cent were negroes the south had become peculiarly the home of lynching cash then goes on to record that of the grand total of negroes lynched in the nation from the beginning of until the close of only were lynched outside the former confederate states and of these were lynched in the border states of maryland kentucky west virginia and missouri themselves more than half southern lynchings aside cash also pointed out that fbi official murder rates showed that the southern cities were over five times as murderous as those of either the north central area or the far west over six times as those of the middle atlantic country and over eighteen times as those of new england true slum negroes did account for many of these southern murders but since the ws was the dominant majority in the south it cannot escape the responsibilty for having set the moral tone of the region of which the overall murder rate is but a reflection such a condition carries over to this day although the ws constitutes per cent of the countrys white population he is responsible for an alarmingly disproportionate share of american crime thus the justic departments latest edition of national prisoner statistics indicates that of all prisoners executed under civil authority in the united states for murder rape armed robbery and kidnaping per cent were wss still another peculiarly southern crime is the deliberate setting of forest fires folksily called firestrolling by wss the region has onefourth of the nations forest acreage but it is annually the scene of over per cent of u s forest fires no less than per cent of southern forest fires during according to an authoritative estimate were the work of deliberate woods burners in louisiana mississippi and florida the percentage ran to per cent and since ws firebugs wait for dry ground and a high wind the cause a total of per cent of our forest acreage loss not only does the ws lawbreaker show disproportionate violence and criminality but there is a similar tendency operating among ws law enforcers this bloodlust is particularly irresistible to ws judges and juries for although the south holds less than onethird of the countrys total population year after year no less than twothirds of american executions take place there illiteracy is still another longstanding ws tradition harry golden in an attempt to escape the crime violence and primitive living standards which pervade their native region over southerners white and negroleft dixie during the s somewhat more than the number of persons who fled east germany during a comparable period unhappily the wsnot to mention his new neighborsfound that he carried these conditions right along with him albert n votaw in the february harpers described the prickly integration problem the ws presented to a typical northern city at that time there were ws recent arrivals in chicago settling together in one south side neighborhood they presented the authorities with a number of difficulties a police captain was quoted as saying they are vicious and knifehappy they are involved in per cent of our arrests in this district observed a municipal court judge youll never improve the neighborhood until you get rid of them other comments on the transplanted ws during the course of the article disorderly untamed to urban ways antisocial to the point of delinquency in the eyes of their neighbors the poor domestic habits they bring from small backwoods communities their housekeeping is easy to the point of disorder children play freely anywhere without any supervision when it comes to sex training their habitswith respect to such matters as incest and statutory rape are clearly at variance with urban legal requirements and parents fail to appreciate the interest authorities take in their sex life on the job they are said to lack ambition considered poor tenants white southern school children are handicapped they are too old for their grades and too mature physically for their classmates prone to disease they are a disgrace to their race a south side school principal has said that the average i q of his pupils most of whom are wss is only moreover only of them had a rating of above the chicago sunday tribune summed things up this way the southern hillbilly migrants who have descended like a plague of locusts in the last few years have the lowest standard of living and moral code if any the biggest capacity for liquor and the most savage tactics when drunk which is most of the time obviously the ws isnt the same kind of person as the wn he just isnt accustomed to or perhaps capable of living the same way the rest of us do and we should make allowances for that fact however at the same time we should put some sensible limit on the extent of the wss participation in business national affairs and interregional social contact after all as harry golden has said would you want your sister to marry a governor faubus the ws may very well represent an insoluble problem in any event it is a problem that will take timea great deal of time perhaps centuriesto even approach solving no one denies the economic disparity between ws and wn but this is only a reflection of genetic facts hereditary equality and total massive integration of the ws into the national economy are things that can neither be rushed nor legislated we must maintain perspective and not plunge headlong into a dubious social experiment for the sake of some vague abstract idea of justice our system may not be perfect but it approaches true justice for all more closely than any other ws and wn should each stick to their own kind moving forward separately and harmoniously as in the past the ws should have enough regional and racial pride to want to develop in his own way and at his own natural pace not force himself in when and where he isnt wanted besides geographical separation is a basic law of nature if the good lord had intended wss and wns to work and live in the same way and locale he would not have created a north and a south in the first place most important of all we cannot risk jeopardizing the american way of life for the sake of the impulsive impatient leaders of a minority that would be a perversion of the true meaning of democracy for although it would undoubtedly raise the ws if the standards of interregional intercourse were relaxed to permit him a larger role in the nations affairs it would at the same time inevitably lower the wn what after all has the ws contributed to american civilization it is an extraordinary catalogue hookworm slavery the filibuster hominy grits the ku klux klan pellagra mint juleps lynching the university of mississippi and high treason in seceding from the union sic transit gloria moonshine of the wss failure to produce a real culture and civilization of his own w j cash said leaving mr jefferson aside the whole south produced not only no original philosopher but no derivative one to set beside emerson and thoreau no novelist but poor simms to measure against the northern galaxy headed by hawthorne and melville and cooper no painter but allston to stand in the company of ryder and a dozen yankees no poet deserving the name save poeonly half a southerner true lately there has been a spurt of interest among residents of the menckendubbed sahara of the bozart in novelwriting but this has never been an activity that could serve as a proper index of the practitioners character industry and moral fiber besides according to gore vidal a wn novelist the ws novelist is not really a writer states vidal southerners talk and talk tell and tell they talk in chronicles they talk in novels emphasis added in other words there is nothing to southern writing but mere gabbiness and the coincidence that some recent flukey change in the structure of a few sets of games has started causing a handful of wss to start putting this gabbiness on paper since there is no artistry involved in idle palaver it is plain that no more cultural credit is due a ws for writing a novel than would be due a monkey typing out gone with the wind by sheer chance it would be patently unfair to leave the impression that all wss are naturally primitive violent criminal shiftless promiscuous uncultured and undistinguished there have been a number perhaps a hundred over the past three and a half centuries who do not fall into those categoriesbut many of these had northern blood among more recent ws notables senator harry flood byrd of virginia and his brother admiral richard byrd have a wn greatgreatgreatgrandmother the father of the late josephus daniels north carolina newspaper editor and statesman was a rhode island ships carpenter zachary taylor twelfth president of the united states had wn ancestry jefferson davis the president of the confederate states was the son of wn and wn blood flowed through the veins of such other stalwarts of the confederacy as major general jeb stuart general james longstreet general john clifford pemberton and john slidell appointed commissioner to france by jefferson davis even daniel boone himself was bom in bucks county pa it should also be duly noted that the figure of the yankee peddler was a familiar one throughout the south during the eighteenth century as he wended his way across the countryside selling his wares it is not inconceivable that in addition to some calicoes scizzors and clocks he may have left behind him some wn genes here and there these might well have made their presence felt without ever showing up on an official genealogy it only needs to be said that the average rankandfile ws today is well satisfied with things as they are but is being goaded on by a handful of agitators and fomentors into making more demands than the country can safely meet or than wss as a whole could handle in their present stage of development who are these clandestine pressure groups and what are they really after a hint was provided in a new york times dispatch of jan about the lures offered by the ws in his drive to attract new industry this steppedup economic warfare wrote atlanta correspondent claude sitton poses a threat to areas in the north and midwest in which rising costs and industrial strife have caused management to grow restless it also has aroused concern in financial circles some securities experts contend that industrial subsidies being offered in both the south and the north are endangering the tax structure and municipal credit and carrying the nation toward state capitalism a south carolina legislative committee has termed these lures somewhat socialistic emphasis added has the kremlin taken over the ws equality movement how sincere is the ws when it can be shown that he is playing directly into the hands of a foreign ideology are we being lulled by a pack of finesounding words into forgetting the wss natural tendencies toward violence and lust these are pressing questions for every wn american to keep in mind during the trying days ahead
the new challenge facing negro leaders by eugene walton or the first hundred ii years following the emancipation negro leadership has been absorbed m eradicating the last vestiges of slavery while the battle against jim crow is by no means won it has progressed to a point from which victory can be dimly seen this is certainly no time for negro leaders to let up in any way but a time to press on until this blemish has been completely obliterated from the american scene in achieving this victory they will have not only met and defeated a challenge to their own ingenuity and resourcefulness but eliminated a serious challenge to the whole american ideal as well but with crusades against social diseases as with crusades against physical diseases victory over one challenge only begets a new challenge and the thing that distinguishes successful from unsuccessful social movements is that the leaders of the former are more alert to recognizing new challenges and directing their energies toward meeting them if the ultimate goal of negro leaders is the elimination of all racial prerequisites to the enjoyment of the good life in america then they must surely recognize the differences between the challenge with which they have wrestled for the first hundred years of emancipation and the new challenge they face upon entering the second hundred years the old challenge has been negative in nature fighting against something but the new challenge is a positive one working for something the old challenge has been to knock out mandatory state supported segregation and other barriers that prevent the individual who happens to be darkskinned from competing and benefiting purely on the basis of merit the new challenge is the building of pride self respect and self esteem and confidence of negroes as a group and to devise and create a new and positive relationship for american negroes visavis american society the new challenge is to follow up the victory over racial barriers with a program that will inspire those previously barred to contribute effectively to the political economic and industrial life in america the new challenge is to provide his dispossessed with the intellectual inspirational and spiritual motivation and equipment required for them to fully benefit from the new oportunities that the removal of the barriers will permit under most circumstances the upgrading of a groups position within a larger environment necessitates accompanying changes within the group itself lest the whole effort fail in the case of the changing status of the negro in america these accompanying changes are doubly necessary because of some of the side effects that the long struggle for desegregation has had on the negro community this is to say that some of the arguments and positions advanced for the benefit of improving the negros status relative to his larger environment have caused certain unanticipated consequences in their attitudes toward themselves that tend to make any racial uplift task more difficult than it otherwise would have been what are some of these unanticipated consequences or side effects and how do they make the new challenge to negro leaders more difficult the first of these is that the negro man in the street is confused over goals on one hand and is cherishing unrealistic expectations on the other the questions raised are where are we negroes going and precisely what kind of bargain are we seeking to come out with is it limited to desegregation and free access to the public sector of american life or is it integration assimilation into the private sectors as well then is integration an end in itself or a means to some other end if so what is that end such questions are raised partly because the american mass media and some negro leaders have carelessly and consistently used the terms desegregation and integration interchangeably and failed to distinguish between the two mass circulation newspapers and magazines have been particularly guilty of reporting negroes efforts to desegregate public facilities under the heading of integration and negro leaders have been equally guilty in not correcting them all this has led the negro man in the street to be unsure of where nirvana is but yet to assume unrealistically that it is integration assimilation and that after the current struggle negroes and whites will live happily ever after the unrealism of this expectation was sharply pointed up by tilma cothran atlanta universitys specialist in social theory before the convention of the american sociological association cothran reported that desegregation where it has occurred in the south has been accepted by whites mainly on the basis of conforming to the law and economic pressure and that very few have accepted the rightness of it even if all the barriers to integration were removed this scholar reported there would not be any tremendous association between whites and negroes the implications of the above situation for meeting the new challenge are serious for a people who are expecting to be consumed in the mainstream can hardly be expected to respond favorably to a program of racial uplift they would resist and oppose such an effort on the grounds that it betrayed what we have been fighting for assimilation and stood in the way of their long desired synthesis the more serious of the side effects of the long struggle is that all these years of talk about the importance of racial balance and integration having some whites mixed in to keep it from being allnegro regardless of what it happens to be has caused serious self depreciation and lack of group pride on the part of the negro in the street the clamor for integration has been so strong and stringent as to leave the implication that anything not integrated is ipso facto bad this subconsciously equating integrated with good and negro or allnegro with bad has created the kind of environment in which a young negro couple inspecting a house for sale asks is the school down the street integrated instead of asking is it the best school in town the new challenge of building the spirit and pride of the negro community in america can not possibly be met unless this unverbalized stigma that negroes attach to negro nonintegrated organizations and institutions is eliminated from their minds if the new goals of selfhelp and uplift are met at all it will surely be through the cooperation and coordination of predominantly negro organizations like the churches newspapers fraternal lodges and civic clubs organized at the grass roots level of the negro communities anyone who thinks that with the passing of state supported segregation negro institutions are going to fold up and die while the negro fades namelessly into the mass is just whistling in the dark besides these unanticipated consequences there are other elements in the current sociopolitical situation that will make the new challenge more difficult for negro leaders one is the existence of the organized black muslims as a new fact of life in applying their own solution to the new challenge black supremacy they have poisoned the air for the more legitimate racial uplift movement they have made it difficult for negro leaders to glorify the distinctive contributions of the negro to american life and to urge negroes to take pride in their negroness without running the risk of being branded a black supremacist or separationist another factor that will make the new challenge more difficult for negro leaders is that it calls for such new behavior on their part they have proven their ability to mobilize the negro community against something segregation but can they also mobilize it for something internal group betterment they will learn if they do not already know that it is one thing to get the negro to fight the evils of the white man but something else to get him to fight the evils within himself it is so much easier to lead a wrecking crew than to lead a construction gang unless a lot of old hands learn new tricks or are replaced with young new hands who know the new tricks the new challenge facing negro leadership could turn out to be more than they can handle these then are some of the consequences and factors that will make the job of negro leaders more difficult as they face their new challenge no one should kid himself about the magnitude of the task that lies ahead but in spite of the difficulty and the magnitude this is a challenge negro leaders can hardly afford not to face lest the whole victory of the first hundred years struggle assume a distinctly hollow ring and leave untouched certain conditions which the new challenge would overcome up to now the crime rate neighborhood deterioration illegitimacy and other unfavorable conditions that exist within the negro community have been blamed on the existence of racial segregation and discrimination such claims it should be clearly noted have been well founded since the correlation between social disorganization and socialeconomicpolitical deprivation can be supported by both rational and statistical arguments but with the passing or drastic reduction of segregation and discrimination this rationale will no longer be valid and yet to expect these conditions to right themselves automatically and without a positive program pushes ones confidence in human nature a bit far these are problems that will be with the negro community long after the court cases and sitins have removed the bars of discrimination unless its leaders face up to this reality and act positively to remedy the situation up to this point we have talked glibly about what the new challenge facing negro leadership is like and the difficulties they can expect in meeting it it would be nice if we could conclude by giving them a sure simple guaranteed solution but of course no such thing exists however we could mention two factors bearing on this problem which suggest that the task before negro leaders is far from hopeless first there is the existence of that magnificent body of negro contributions to american culture which we will call negro culture here lies a solid contribution in religious and nonreligious music humor literature and culinary art of which every american negro can be justly proud and which can be used as a kind of news peg for a program to build the spirit and pride of the negro community it provides an alternative to the black supremacy ideology used by the black muslims and can become an excellent positive starting place for a complete reorientation of the negro selfimage the second factor that makes the new challenge facing negro leadership more hopeful than hopeless is that there are already definite signs cthat negro leaders have recognized this challenge and are preparing to meet it most encouraging of these signs was the thematic tone of the national convention of the urban league meeting the conference focused its attention on meeting the changing challenges of tomorrow and was keyed to the problems of unemployment due to automation school dropouts youth incentives migrant adjustment and family disorganization at the conference the executive director dr whitney young indicated that the league has been criticized for being too slow too conservative and failing to produce the results of the congress of racial equality the naacp the southern christian leadership conference and the studentnonviolent coordinating committee it could be we submit that the differences in perception of the effectiveness of these organizations is because the latter ones are reaping the glory of the finale of the original challenge while the league is tooling up to meet the new while the glory of the first century of struggle on behalf of the negro in america certainly belongs to the naacp it may very well be that the new challenge of the second century will belong to the urban league but more likely however it will belong to core naacp sclc urban league and many more organizations yet to be born the challenge is certainly large enough to engross them all the meaning of the i egro experience by dr c eric lincoln ne balmy afternoon in the late summer of a ship of the royal dutch navy put about and tacked slowly into the harbor at jamestown virginia there was something strange about the appearance and the movement of the ship something grotesque and foreboding there was something repulsive and evil about that ship the colonists waiting at the dockside experienced an unaccustomed shudder of apprehension as with an ominous rumble the long anchor chain uncoiled itself and brought the ship up fast against the wharf the captain of the dutch ship caused the plank to be lowered and went ashore followed by as motley a crew of sailors as had ever put to sea their provisions were gone their water was gone they had no moneybut the captain explained that his ship carried a cargo well worth the provisions he wanted the settlers to exchange for it it was a strange cargo it was a cargo of men lying in the darkness in the hold of the dutch manofwar were one hundred separate items of human fleshchained ankle to ankle and wrist to wrist braving the terrible stench and ignoring the cries of the suffering captives by the dim light of a ships lantern the virginians picked out twenty and carried them ashore in chains by that act they founded in democratic america a most peculiar institution an institution about which thomas jefferson himself a slaveholder was to reveal the lacerations of his own conscience when he said i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever this was the first and most compelling image america has had of the negro the image of a commodity a thing to be bought and sold or exchanged a thing to be used in the production of wealth and power comfort and egosatisfaction for the benefit of those who own or have dominion over it with the clairvoyant wisdom which made him a great leader george washington had this to say about negroes as a commodity i shall be happily mistaken if they are not found to be a very troublesome species of property ere many years have passed over our heads george washington has been gathered with the blest for years but that troublesome species of property first landed at jamestown virginia years ago has perhaps proven mr washington unhappily unmistaken for men are not property they are not commodities they may not be bought and sold either on the slave block or at the employment office or in the courts or at the bargaining table or in the real estate office for so long as they are so long will they be troublesome the image of an explorer i have said that the early image most americans have of the negro in america is that of a commodity such was not the negros first role on this continent nor within the present boundaries of this country if no welldefined image consistent with his earlier experiences here has been developed then american history and racial understanding are poorer for the deficiency had you been aboard the good ship pinta on october you would have noticed that among those rejoicing at the sighting of land was a small black man with the air of a scholar he was pedro alonzo nino navigator of the flag ship on which columbus sailed he was a negro if you had marched with balboa to the shores of the pacific in you would have known nuflo de olano one of the thirty negroes included in his expedition or had you served with navarez in you would have thrilled to the heroism of estevanico his negro lieutenant who led an expedition into what is now arizona and new mexico opening up the great southwest for european conquest estevanico died fighting the indians years before the first wagon train rolled westward from the mississippi there were negroes with the spaniards in south america at the conquest of peru with the french in the settlement of the mississippi valley and the founding of chicago and in more recent times even with admiral peary at the discovery of the north pole but the image of the negro as an explorer has not been sustained in the mind of america indeed except for a handful of scholars the negros role in discovery and exploration has remained classified information the image of uncle tom let us look quickly at two other historical images both are stereotypes from the slave period one is that of a gentle old man his hair is white and woolly his back is bent and his shoulders are rounded from a lifetime of genuflection he observes a controlled deference to his betters and a supercilious indifference to the disapproval of his peers he is the medium through which communication passes from one class to another he is the channel of distribution moving from the top to the bottom he is the channel of information moving from the bottom to the top his function is that of control and pacification control of one class for the exploitation of another and the pacification of one class for the protection of another his personal reward is the favor and the protection of the power structure and they call him uncle tom he is rewarded by his peers with suspicion and hatred and envy and fear they rely upon his offices indeed they have no choice and they also call him uncle but never to his face this is an image of the american negro during the slave era it is an image which has persisted into quite recent times but it is an image which has been painfully eroded by the acids of social change the power structure has found the image of uncle tom to be a reliable agent of class control no longer the negro has found the image of uncle tom no longer capable of delivering even the oldtime fractional benefits once surreptitiously lifted from the treasury of american citizenship and further the negro today does not want anything that it takes an uncle tom to procure todays negro doesnt want charity he does want a chance uncle tom is in bad health he will soon be dead the image of a freedom fighter on the second of october in there appeared in the boston gazette the following notice ran away from his master william brown on the th of september last a negro fellow about years of age named crispus feet inches high short curls hair his knees nearer together than common had on a light colourd bearskin coat blue yarn stockings and a checked woolen shirt whoever shall take up said runaway and convey him to his master shall have ten pounds reward history does not record whether the tall knockkneed negro was ever taken up and returned to his master but history has recorded the story of his martyrdom in the cause of american freedom it was the morning of march that the first american patriot died for a cause which remains so dear to us all a cause we have since defended successfully many times but a cause which is forever in jeopardy for the enemies of freedom are not always strangers from abroad so often they lie coiled within the bosom of democracy itself on a cold blustery morning in march years ago a company of british soldiers marched briskly up state street in the heart of downtown boston they had chosen state street because it was the principal street of what was then the principal city in america their objective was to remind the americans of their continued subjection to the british crown and to suppress with force any protestations of injustice or any complaints about secondclass citizenship the americans had become very unhappy over being taxed while being denied representation in the government taxation without representation is galling to any selfrespecting citizenry indeed no people could be reasonably expected to rejoice over a kind of citizenship that required them to share responsibility while privilege was withheld or deferred so it was that when the british soldiers swung arrogantly up the streetresplendent in their scarlet jackets and arrogant and confident in the superiority of their weapons they could not have been surprised to find themselves challenged to be sure the challenge did not come from the class with vested interests for that class was in league with the crown the challenge came from the kind of men for whom principle is more important than wealth or station or even personal security the challenge came from men for whom the vision of equality and justice for all was a presently attainable objective facing the british at the end of state street was a handful of patriots at the head was crispus attucks a man who had established his personal freedom by running away as a youth but who had now as a man returned to play his part in making a more complete freedom available for every americanincluding the master who had put a price on his head as the company of redcoats approached attucks turned to his supporters the way to get rid of these soldiers he said is to attack the main guard with sticks and clubs and whatever weapons that came to hand the americans did attack as crispus attucks led the charge the british soldiers opened fire and he was first to fall three men died with attucks at the boston massacre but the struggle against tyranny had been joined and ultimately the cause of freedom and justice did prevail that america is today a free country testifies most eloquently to the availability of freedom when brave men work together in mutual confidence and determination today we are all free but we are not yet equally free we have been a long time completing the job begun in boston so many years ago crispus attucks provides an image of the american negro as a freedom fighter not many americans remember attucks fewer still not his race his statue still stands on the boston greensward along with those of other heroes of the american revolution for attucks was the first american of any race to give his life in the cause of freedom it is a pity that the editors of our childrens textbooks do not know this or do not think it significant for these times there were many others to follow attucks for the freedom of america did not mean that all americans were free the struggle to be free was continued by negro leaders like nat turner denmark vesey gabriel prosser and others whose names are lost to history contrary to the widely circulated fiction of the negros docile acceptance of slavery there were at least recorded revolts in america between and a period of years in addition there were no fewer than fiftyfive revolts at sea during a similar period since it was the practice to suppress news about slave uprisings less they become infectious it is reasonable to assume that scores of insurrections must have gone unrecorded the historical image of the negro as a freedom fighter is certainly one which must be considered if the current struggle for freedom and dignity is to have perspective we need to talk about the past because the present has no meaning except with reference to the past and to the future america cannot hope to understand the complex image of the contempo rary negro unless there is an historical screen against which to project it we cannot understand the sitins the freedom riders the black muslims the naacp or even the urban league except in the context of antecedent behavior the keys to the negros resentments his forebearance his hostility his love his patience his weariness with waiting his resignation and his determination are all there in his previous condition but the full story of his previous condition is not a mere tale of abject servitude there has not been enough said about the past the negros strengths and his weaknesses are reflected in the images he has of himself and others have of him most negroes have displayed a childish squeamishness about probing negro history they have been too afraid that research might lead to some dark jungle and that the negro would be further disgraced they have been too afraid of being deprived of certain convenient excuses for comfortable mediocrity they seem to enjoy in a segregated society the white man has preferred not to disturb the negros past because he wants no new challenge to his moral consciousness no new feelings of guilt he does not wish to risk the possibility that some outofdate conclusions may on reexamination require some adjustment in his habits of thinking or patterns of behavior it sometimes appears that negroes and whites are joined in a conspiracy of silence for their mutual protection against social and moral embarrassment the threefold myth the racial chauvinists in the south are far from silent in centennial celebrations all over the old confederacy the diehards are resurrecting the pale grey ghost of the civil war they are doing so with the meek compliance of the north and very often with the financial and technical assistance of agencies of the federal government which might well be occupied with more plausible and more socially profitable undertakings the civil war image of the south being offered today to americas innocent and unsuspecting children and to their unprotesting parents is very often fraudulent fictional irrelevant and inane it is an image which carefully ignores the fundamental issues over which the civil war was fought white supremacy is busily engaged in beating a dead horse to make him win a race that is over the resurrection of the grand illusion would be pathetic if ours were a more sophisticated or even a more moral society unfortunately the trinal myth of the negros inherent inferiority his satisfaction with thingsastheyare and the white mans good intentions to be executed of his own initiative byeandbye is still supported by a formidable cult if the negro continues his attacks upon the segregated institutions of the north the cult of the grand illusion is certain to grow larger at least for a time bigotry must have an image of its victim consistent with its aim the negros selfimage the negro has some images of himself whereas outsiders tend to see one negroa composite stereotyped image of the race negroes see themselves as a multifaceted american subgroup with many images some good some indifferent some bad what is the negros image of the negro in america it depends upon which negro you ask it is the dramatic image of thurgood marshall pleading the cause of human justice before the high court of the nation and the conscience of the people it is the image of a shoeshine boy in nashville refusing to scramble for a ioc tip flipped into the gutter at his feet it is the image of martin_luther_king challenging a hatefilled and often violent postchristian society to relearn the great principles of the sermon on the mountshowing them how to win over hatred with love and how to overcome violence with humble faith and selfrestraint it is the image of elijah muhammadblack messenger of a black god calling the disconsolate and arming them with hatred a bitter man this muhammad and one tired of waiting for his share of america leader of the militant black muslims who return hatred for hatred insult for insult blow for blow a black supremacist in search of victory over white supremacy it is the image of jackie robinson maintaining speed while shifting gearsmoving on from a brilliant career in sports to an executive position in a major american business enterprise it is the image of ralph bunche doing a job for his country and losing his racial identity in the process it is the image of ralph boston and wilma rudolph saving the day for america on the olympic fields of the world it is the image of malcolm_x strident apostle of black nationalism preaching in the black ghettos debating at the universities haranguing on the street comers shouting from the television screen and the eleven oclock radio shows think black buy black stay black and beware the white mans phony integration it is the image of louis armstrong the ambassador with a horn at his lips and of chubby checker teaching the world a new twist it is the image of nine little teenagers at little rocks central high schoolignoring the insults accepting the hot soup poured on their heads the lighted cigarettes dropped down their backs the screaming mothers the bombs and the dynamite while the world recoiled in horrorand then cheered and cheered and cheered it is the image of college youth all over americasitting in riding in wading in reading in kneeling inand sometimes having to crawl outgoing to jail accepting their punishment and then sitting in again it is the image of the urban league executives working quietly but persuasively with the concerned and responsible citizens of the great metropolisestrying to make urban living better for all the people irrespective of race or creed the negros image of the negro is sometimes one of a steadily increasing middleclass with all of the status pretentions of the white middle class it is the image of a burgeoning black bourgeosie striving mightily to become totally assimilated into the mainstream of america and suffering massive frustration for having failed there is another imageone of hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers caught in the deteriorated inner circle of the great cities of america the black ghettos ringed with bands of steelpolitical steel economic steel the cold hard steel of prejudice it is the image of crime of drug addiction alcoholism burglary desertion assault prostitution gambling and murder it is the image of unemployment destitution bitterness hopelessness disease and resignation it is the image of extreme poverty in the midst of an affluent society it is the image of a raw deal it is the image of a keg of powder with a six inch fuse the image of a hungry man the most compelling image i know of the contemporary negro is that of a hungry man this is the era of the hungry man to some the abominable hungry man the hungry man is the symbol of very many millions ol people who are hungry for food hungry for understanding hungry for freedom and selfdetermination but most of allhungry for the dignity without which a man is a thing a chattel and a commodity the dignity without which a man is a misfit a monstrous joke in his own eyes a broken vessel in the eyes of god the sign of the hungry man is his determination his dedication his quiet insistence and his courage it is the sign of the search for dignity the negro is like a certain hungry man who though an uninvited guest has seated himself as unobtrusively as possible at the banquet table of america since he was not invited he has come of his own accord since no place was set for him he has brought his own utensils this makes him abominable for no diner of good breeding comes unasked and then brings to the table his own knife and fork but this hungry man has come to eat he feels his right to be there for he has shared in the cultivation of the fields in the production of the food and in the protection of the common heritage that is america from the hostile incursions of our common enemies who would have put us all to the sword the hungry man is seated at the banquet table of america he sees the rich viands passed back and forth in front of him as the opulent diners officially ignore his presence and make merry eating and drinking to satiety i say that the hungry man is officially ignored for behind the convivial facade the light and pleasant chatter the clever exchange of anecdotes there is an uneasy awareness that the hungry man is about to become a problem he refuses to go away he doesnt seem to frighten anymore he is dressed in evening clothes like all the other diners and he sits there like a man who is determined to be served he is quiet and dignified but he has big shoulders he has big hands the problem how to pacify him with the least cost and inconvenience how to get him outor get him served without a commotion that may well spoil the banquet for everybody but the hungry man isnt leaving he has come to eat he has come to stay he has taken his seat at the banquet table he worked so faithfully to help prepare he is sittingin until hes served this is his moment in the struggle for freedom and dignity throughout the world a world in which men have been enslaved by men for so long that the orderly processes of history have been disturbed and the moral nature of man has been grotesquely distorted the negros prevailing selfimage is in general reflected in the determination that if the most desirable values of our society have been consistently preempted on the arbitrary basis of race then the forces which sustain that arrangement ought to be challenged his struggle is nothing more than what america ought to expect of its citizens the selfrespecting contemporary negro is determined that color shall no longer be the criterion by which his opportunities and his personal dignity and worth are to be measuredneither in the south nor in the north nor anywhere else in this democratic society shackles may be made of iron lacerating the flesh and restraining the body but there are shackles of custom and tradition the prejudice which binds the mind kills the spirit and deforms the soul of anyone it touches negroes will no longer submit to bigotry america can no longer expect it of them the essence of the negro almost a hundred years have passed since the fourteenth amendment recognized the image of the negro to be the image of a citizen a hundred years is a very long time for people in an equalitarian democracy to fail to make fully effective the normal expectations of citizenship our national behavior has not been consistent with the very reasonable expectation that the highest values available on equal terms to all instead of working to eliminate causes we have been expending our resources on symptoms instead of policing the forests we have been dissipating our energies running from brush fire to brush firetoo late and with too little water instead of looking for essence we have been looking at images and trying to construct programs on sands that shift with each passing wind an image is a chimera it is always changingalways appearing differently from different perspectives an image is always reflecting the vicissitudes of the times the pressures and opportunities of the moment it is always partly the creation of the man who perceives it image is what you see essence is what you feel in trying to deal with an image one may miss the broader opportunity of encountering a person i have to say that there is no one image of the negro upon which sincere people should attempt to base their social attitudes one can no more generalize about million black americans than one can about million white americans image is what you see essence is what you feel human images differ from day to day from group to group and within the group every group human essence is the same in all menall the time it is that peculiar quality which makes a man a man and separates him from all other possibilities it is essence with which we ought to be concerned for if we were there could be but one image and that would be the image of america notes written at the century mark by murray kempton ghere is a harlem in new york city and there is a harlem in albany georgia that is where the ordinary negro lives out his life there are two lines that william butler yeats set down about another country also productive of special talents but generally inhabited by propertyless country people and their children parnell came down the road he said to a cheering man ireland shall get her freedom and you still break stone a friend of mine talked recently to a negro who had traveled the south looking for work i like to get to a town early the negro said when the garbage trucks are out i look at the back to see whos handling the garbage if its a white man i move on theres no job in that town for me to this have we come one hundred years after the emancipation proclamation how strange that we who are white should think of that date with pride and that the negro should think of it with gratitude every reference to it is a reminder that as recently as our greatgrandfathers time americans held other americans as bond slaves and might well have kept holding them if the south had not gone to war to expand the limits of a system which the north was resigned merely to containing still we boast of this event and the negro is appreciative of it perhaps the stereotypes are accurate and white people are smug and negroes are instinctively polite yet even an instinct may be submerged by the overpowering pressures of circumstances pressures which can produce the muslims a current concern of fashion it is not a fashion i am afraid that has much to do with what they are about because the concern is for their words and not their faces the muslims are most relevant to an unmentioned fact about the negros real situation in the american city most black nationalists are persons of small education in middle age with menial employment the rest of their lives holds no other prospect integration if it came tomorrow would not alter their lives integration cannot make the poor comfortable and the untrained skillful the american economy seems peculiarly designed for the care and feeling of incompetent white men the union fleshpeddler the sheriff of holmes county mississippi the television space salesman the loud man in the saloon all these luxuries of a wasteful society have no real claim upon our contributions to their comfort except that they are citizens and white if they were negroes how many of them would have any expression but black nationalism the negro makes his way to the extent he makes it at all only as creator there are important negro novelists but no fashionable negro critics negroes produce jazz for which the explanatory notes are always written by white critics the parasitic occupations are not for negroes our surplusage sits in offices exercising its imagination only to fabricate expense accounts their surplusage sits on doorsteps in harlem in the daytime there will never be many muslims but i should be surprised if there were not a little muslim in every negro it would be hard to think of an american negro no matter how psychologically integrated who does not enjoy the speeches of malcolm_x a negro who hates us so much that he adopted the initial x to erase his original surname of little which he has to assume belonged originally to the white family that also owned his ancestors but there is no muslim either who is so thoroughly alienated as he says and genuinely feels he is i once served as chairman of a roundtable of negro speakers one of whom was malcolm_x the audience was largely muslim it was a few days after a los angeles muslim temple had been shot up by the local police malcolm_x was in a condition of honest shock and indignation and his audience cheered fervently his message that no white man deserved to be liked or trusted my main function for the occasion was as object to be pointed at in evidence yet as i was leaving three muslims came up to meet me and asked whether i could go to los angeles and find out the truth about what had happened to their brothers they were that ready to trust an enemy they had never seen before that night for there is also a little bit of every negro which understands what camus meant when he said that we are all condemned to live together yet the act of living together can provide release this is a lesson jackie robinson taught perhaps the most conventional of all the things robinson did for america is seldom mentioned robinson could be harsh combative and ungracious after a while he was free to be these things when the fit was on him that right was hardearned for him but he gave us for nothing the priceless boon of being able to dislike him as a human being it was never possible not to respect robinson but it was easy if you were not a dodger fan to be affronted by his belligerence on the field he did not represent a race he competed for a team it was a moment of emancipation for him and for us the first time he was booed not as a negro but as jackie robinson a dodger player robinsons last important hit in baseball was a triple in the world series against the yankees he hit it as a judgment of history over the head of enos slaughter a north carolinian who as a saint louis cardinal had welcomed robinson to the major leagues and the border south by trying to spike him that nigger robinsons hit won the game for the dodgers afterwards a brave sports writer asked slaughter whether he might not have misjudged the ball there aint a left fielder in this game could have caught that ball slaughter answered i never saw even that bastard hit a ball that hard it was jackie robinsons triumph that when he came into the league enos slaughter called him that nigger and when he went out enos slaughter called him that bastard sonny liston may tell us still more than robinsonor even ralph buncheabout the negros progress since emancipation liston is the first morallyinferior negro to be given an equal chance at a position revered by any great number of his fellow americans that is a revolutionary movement for to be a negro in america is to be required to be superior to your station in life liston has an impressive crimimcprh mest mccci nal record but he is not the first thug of this generation to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world by all evidence he is a cleaner fighter inside the ring than tony galento ever thought of being but he is the first negro thug to have that chance before liston a negro heavyweight was expected not merely to fight well enough to win the office but to ennoble it when he got it the most significant opposition to listons advancement did not come from the white citizens councils to whom any negro is as bad as any other unless that other is like floyd patterson a member of the national association for the advancement of colored people it came rather from negroes who thought liston might disgrace their community there were reports that ralph bunche had asked patterson not to risk this disaster there is of course a gap between negroes who have made their way in the white world and those who have been left behind but in this case bunche seemed to reflect a universal sentiment harlem by all accounts was as united against liston as it had been against any challenger for the championship since joe louis fought max schmeling in yet for once at least the negro has judged us whites unfairly sonny liston is not a negro hoodlum to us but simply a hoodlum in his small way he is rendering the special service so many other negroes have given america which is to tell us the truth about ourselves he is the first heavyweight champion to suggest to us the truth about the office he holds it was affecting to have a champion who talked as though he were seeking admission to the university of mississippi but it was also ridiculous pathetic and deceptive sonny liston is a symbol of national maturity there is no longer danger that he will discredit the negro he offers only the bright promise of giving boxing the discredit it has deserved all these years we shall never again i am sure have a member of the presidents cabinet unequipped with a special assistant who is a negro one of his duties a basic necessity of government is to provide protective coloration sonny liston has finally relieved the negro of this function for boxing maturity comes more slowly in other areas of national life but the last five years of all this depressing century have been the best and they began somewhere when no one was looking they might be said for purposes of identification to have begun in clay kentucky where the negro settlement is by decision of the citizens of clay outside of town a nineyearold boy named james gordon was listening to the radio and heard about the national guard being summoned to enforce integration in a school a hundred miles away mommy he asked why cant i go to the white school if his mother answered you got the guts to go i got the guts to take you and he and she went down to the school together and were driven off with shotguns and the national guard came in for them too there were never many of them yet they and the children who follow them have turned and changed that which everyone had thought would be the inevitable development of the south a decade ago the hope of the south was generally considered to be in its upper middle class the south was full of white people who understood that segregation waswhat was that expressionmorally wrong and who reached out their hands to what tiny negro middle class there was but now they are silent it was out of the black poor the most powerless and abandoned of our citizens that people came who had the guts to go the white middle class can no longer talk to the negro middle class but there has come the poor barely literate southern negro child meeting the poor white face to face enforcing a reminder of his human identity and because of these children it will never again be easy for a southern deputy sheriff to think one negro like every other charley jones of charlotte north carolina has been in prison eight times as a core leader the last time was in albany georgia where by then the police were so welltrained and circumspect that some advanced social thinkers complained that there was not enough violence to dramatize the problem and dont you think its nice that theyre not beating us up any longer charley jones answered i guess youve never been in a southern jail how proud a southern negro woman is of a son who goes to jail the negro male is peculiarly a menial in this culture and he is a menial whose degradation is less in demand than it once was the negro woman as domestic is most often the support of the family the image of a negro boy who wills to go to jail to assert himself a man is a sudden delightful surprise i dont think its fair an albany mother said last summer to get a boy out of jail if he dont want to who would have thought that these school children when they began might have done something as important as to make life easier for every poor southern negro who goes to jail a hundred years later they have started where the emancipation proclamation should have started all these things are of course simple and obvious but after a century it remains a particular complication that what is truly obvious is so seldom said a mother reported with pride to me the other m day her daughters comment on the mississippi riots but this little girl had said its all so simple it doesnt make any difference what color anyones skin is but what is simple and obvious is quite the opposite it makes an enormous difference what color a mans skin is the difference is not just in the places a negro is kept out of but in the atmosphere of the places he gets into i have a friend who is a reporter for one of the news magazines his specialties exceptionally nonparochial for a negroare labor and politics he was in chicago one day and stopped in to see adlai stevenson right after his greeting stevenson said wryly that he supposed his visitor had come to talk about civil_rights when he was only a candidate for president john f kennedy met twice with jackie robinson to solicit his support the meetings were cold hostile and left the senator baffled what does robinson want he asked one of those he questioned asked in turn what they had talked about oh civil_rights of course senator kennedy answered only civil_rights of course said the senator white southerners thought for years that negroes werent interested in civil_rights we are more enlightened we think they arent interested in anything else any negros face in a white public place in our world is consequently likely to be the face of the negro that is the problem in some ways he has more privacy in the south because he is taken for granted there how many secret meetings of white citizens council leaders have been held in offices while the omnipresent negro porter went in and out emptying ash trays this is not a fanciful notion i once spent a long afternoon in the office of a citizens council leader in a southern city near the end he turned confidential you know he said theres something i dont understand they know everything we do just as soon as we do i bet theyve got my office wired right now and are taking down everything i say a negro porter was cleaning his waiting room at that moment and could certainly hear everything he said i looked at the porter and constructed a whole network of colored domestics reporting back on masters who like this one were not even aware of their presence i sat there and elected him a conspirator and laughed inside and cheered him on but was that not an invasion of his privacy an assumption one would hardly make about a stranger unless that stranger were a negro it was at best a mixed compliment to refuse to spy can after all be a point of pride so it does make a difference when your face is a label and once a society decides without feeling any need to ask him that a man is nothing except the burning embodiment of a problem with time he comes to seem to us only a crank to government he seems only an inconvenience mississippi would have been quiet if james meredith had not insisted on enrolling in its university offer no victims and there will be no mobs the negro affronts our conscience less than he disturbs our peace and there is a little bit of government in all of us we only are when we see a negro we confront someone who threatens to become to narrow the question almost everyone seems to know by now that white people do not understand the negro but is what everyone knows necessarily the truth we owe to unknown southern negroes whatever has been epic in the history of the united states for the last ten years cooks and maids poor farmers students in colleges that hardly have libraries have become authors of that history cities where no change seemed possible have found themselves at the mercy of little colored children who have gone afraid but proud to prison and emerged laughing sonny liston looks back over what has been as close to an animal existence as could be possible for an american and the only figure outside his world who seems to him worthy of admiration is martin_luther_king and who predicted this wild card in our history except william faulkner we know now that we should have gone to him to find out what the southern negro could do in the same way we wentwe know now to richard wright and ralph ellison and james baldwin not to find out what negroes are but what white people are what is more likely i am afraid is that whatever our color we do not understand ourselves how to spot phony intellectual by horton floyd he definitions a q of an intellectual proj vided by websters jd new international dictionary are the following a person endowed with intellect having the power of understanding having the capacity for the higher forms of knowledge or thought a member of a party or faction claiming to represent or regarded as representing intelligent opinion the above definitions have to do with people who are intellectuals and therefore have the right to be called intellectuals interestingly enough however the people who fit the definitions usually are the people who prefer not to be labelled as intellectuals they take their intelligence and erudition for granted and go about the business of creative labor contributing to art and science and literature and philosophy breastbeating and posturing are characteristics alien to these people they are true intellectuals on the other hand there is a vast and growing breed of poseurs who have all but abrogated to themselves the term intellectual the adjective pseudo which means phony probably best describes them generally but within the group as a whole there are a multitude of variations some of the more familiar specimens of this allembracing breed are described below the philosopher this is the highesttype pseudointellectual for his or her realm of specialized knowledge is in the rarified heights of philosophical profundity with this type it is impossible to engage in a simple uncomplicated discussion all conversa tional avenues lead to quotations from aristotle and plato and every current situation must be considered in the context of great philosophical concepts with this intellectual any sentence or statement is challengeable he delights in differing and will proceed to prove that black is not really black or that the tree standing ten feet away does not really exist names like kant hegel sartre hobbes and descartes and terms like nihilism existentialism theism and empiricism fall from the lips of the philosophical intellectual with the ease of water dripping from a faucet concepts like truth beauty and love which every normal human being is content to accept in their ordinary and usual connotations must be laid out under the microscope of philosophical technique and analyzed and dissected into utter meaninglessness the philosophical intellectual seems happiest when communication is most muddled which may very well be the best indication of the state of his own mentality the psychoanalyst this species is very close to the preceding species they may be said to be unidentical twins while the philosopher is concerned with considering everything in the light of a philosophical discipline the psychoanalyst is intent on forcing everything through the funnel of freudian interpretation the psychoanalyst never accepts anything at face value he must of necessity get to the real meaning behind every word or gesture and this real meaning is never apparent it must always be ferreted out to this unlicensed headshrinker sleeplessness is proof of a guilty conscious friendship for someone of the same sex is latent homosexuality and opposition to domineering parents means an oedipus complex is abroad in the psyche most of the time these amateur analysts have simply had a few college courses in psychology and using their own troubled souls as springboards are intent on proving their superior insight and education the deadliest of the species however are those whose unsolvable problems led them to the professional analysts couch these specimens are like religious zealots they talk and think about nothing but headshrinking and their analysts are the very disciples of the great god freud that these people are sick goes without saying what is significant is the nature of their malady almost without exception they are afflicted with a feeling of inferiority so deep and so basic that not even all of freuds vast army of followers could dig it out and kill it the beard this is a relatively new species of pseudo intellectual in the united states as a whole for many years their habitat in this country was limited by the borders of new yorks greenwich village but they escaped a decade or so ago to places like san francisco and taos and have been generously flourishing all over the landscape ever since speaking generally the beards are a harmless bunch often charming and occasionally even genuine intellectuals may be found among them one such is novelist john a williams a masterful writer and a fine young man who confessed in an article in nugget magazine that he affected his whiskers to disguise an unromantic chin while many of the beardwearing musicians may be classified as intellectuals some like the modern jazz quartets john lewis being the real item all of them are not some musicians wear beards like badges in much the same fashion as phi beta kappas or legionnaires the beards under consideration here are rarely musicians although they sometimes affect a great passion for jazz they are free and independent and rebellious souls or they like to think of themselves in that image but it is dangerous to pursue the question of what they are free from independent of and rebellious against for their answers if they are articulate enough to give answers will usually serve to strip from them every facade of glamour far too frequently it develops that they are free of jobs and the desire to find remunerative work they are independent of responsibility and its concomitant stability and they are in rebellion against maturity of course they will put it differently they will give longwinded speeches about the conformity of american society the degradation of to labor and the utter meaninglessness of the struggle for achievement it is perhaps cruel to say so but far too many of these bearded rebels merely have a greater conception of their own value than they find it possible to express being frustrated by limited talent they take refuge in unlimited posing the excess hair helps to give the distinction they so desperately crave but seem unable to earn the aficionado aficionado is a spanish word meaning roughly a fan it is usually applied to followers of bullfighting those fevered addicts who know and savor every twist of the toreros toe every sweep of the cape every lunge of the bull transported across the atlantic aficionado has come to mean on the one hand an expert and on the other hand a knowitall and since a true expert is a person secure in his knowledge with no need for pretense aficionado does not apply to the expert in this case the concern here is with the aficionado as a knowitallor a phony this species of intellectual is usually found on the periphery of the arts especially jazz he calls all the musicians by their first names just as if he knows them and he uses all the wayout terminology current among jazz musicians bird parker the dead tenor saxophonist is the hallowed and sanctified high priest and miles davis is the holy son there is no other music but jazz and no other musicians but jazzmen and cursed be those who do not worship at the shrine and honor the commandments dope the instrument of death and dishonor among so many jazz musicians holds a very special place in the mystique of the aficionados world it is the open sesame to that surrealistic and levitated mood so endemic to that realm of night while more prevalent on the edges of jazz the aficionado is also found on the outskirts of art sometimes he is a painter an inept one who attempts to compensate for his inadequacy by affecting the airs of a connoisseur he knows what is good painting and what is junk and the incomprehensibles of socalled modern art are all clarities to him whatever the artist was trying to express the aficionado understands it and if it just so happens that the artist in fact was merely expressing his own boredom and lack of imagination then the aficionado comes to the rescue by seeing beyond this aridity to irrepressible talent ah the aficionado is indomitable unconquerable supremely confident in an ignorance without bounds the africanist this is the very latest of the species in the pseudointellectual breed and it is growing with all deliberate speed the most vocal and enthusiastic of this species are those whoa scant decade agowould have come close to puking had it been suggested that they identify with africa and africans now they adore anything african they almost have reached the point where they love anything black but they havent become that extreme yet they talk knowingly of ashanti stools and yoruba culture and the hausa language and can roll off the capitals of the three areas of nigeria with more ease than they can name the states of new england they can hold forth for hours on the glories of ancient mali or the power of the old ghana kings or the beauties of the songhay regime they speak with great erudition of the concept of negritude and could not if their lives depended on it give a coherent statement of the concepts meaning having seized africa and claimed it for their very own they will denounce and challenge anyone who even hints that africans are not all fine and noble and beautiful in short these africaloving pseudointellectuals use africa as a crutch in very much the same way that the aficionados use jazz as a crutch there is a strange militancy about their procedure africa they feel is on the ascendancy and if they can identify with it now then they can ascend with it they will never have to recognize and admit that they havent the stuff to make it on their own there are many other species of the breed of pseudointellectual but the abovementioned ones are the most prevalent true intellectuals have a largeness of outlook and spirit phony intellectuals are narrow and mean they are easy enough to sight they are seldom thoughtful compassionate and willing to listen they are always cocksure and arrogant and all too often wrong floyd patterson revisited by hosea l martin few months ago a friend of mine sent me the july issue of negro digest in his accompanying letter he called my attention to the article are todays athletes too dull by a s doc young im sure my friend sent me the magazine as a joke since i was something of a lackluster athlete in my college days at any rate the article was quickly read and just as quickly forgotten or more truthfully it was filed in that compartment of my mind reserved for articles by frustrated sportswriters who couldnt make their high school football team then came september and the pattersonliston fight ordinarily i have only a passing interest in boxing perhaps because a turbulent boyhood on chicagos south side left me unable to appreciate or understand the spectacle of two grown men beating hell out of each other with mere fists when there were so many really effective weapons at their disposal on th street the cardinal rule had been waste no time with fists and hands when a brick can send em to the promised land violation of this rule could possibly afford the individual his only opportunity to have his name appear in the chicago defenderin the section labeled obituaries my reaction to the pattersonliston skirmish however was a little more than slightly different however passive it might have been i was giving my support to patterson for somehow the mass media had been able to project the image of a young man epitomizing those virtues we find so admirable in public figures skill reticence and a sense of the importance of his position while still maintaining a posture of humility and childlike awe the fact that he was beaten didnt disturb me for defeat has nothing to do with the shattering of an image what truly disturbed me was the unconcealed glee that greeted the news of his defeat was i alone in my admiration of floyd patterson i asked myself and if so what was there about him that blinded others to his qualities that i considered so attractive these were the questions that compelled me to return to that dustcovered issue of negro digest surely i thought mr young would have an explanation for the almost universal rejection of this fallen warrior so i carefully reread that profound article and not being able to believe my eyes read it a third time the fourth reading convinced me that neither advancing age nor the strenuous military life i was leading had impaired my vision to the extent that i would miss a name on a printed page the only conclusion i could draw was that mr young was guilty of a monumental sin of omission in his classification of sports figures he had not classified floyd patterson as neither colorful nor colorless in fact patterson had not been mentioned at all now it doesnt take a mel allen or jimmy powers to realize that the heavyweight boxing championship is in the eyesight of many as significant a position as the presidency of the united states i will always cherish the memory of that seemingly dull student in my high school civics class who couldnt recall where the president resided but volunteered to recite the training sites of louis charles and walcott if one claims that that student should have been admonished then the same punishment should apply to the millions of adults who deemed it their duty to sit glued to their radios until the last punch was thrown in a championship match yet thought nothing of retiring early on the night of a presidential election you will note that i said those devotees sat glued to their radios until the last punch was thrown i make this distinction because many negroes during the era of joe louis felt that the postfight statements by the brown bomber were just too painful to listen to so the wireless was promptly switched off the moment he was called to the mike the few brave ones who did listen to louis classic hi ma i glad i win would invariably squirm with embarrassment and moan why cant he devote a little of his training time to the study of english fewer still were able to recognize and appreciate the pure exhilaration and sincerity conveyed by louis clumsy statement it had an effect on that few that has never been approached by the flowery rhetoric of sugar ray robinson or archie moore but the fact remained that the great hero had flaws glaring flaws that were quickly noted and laughed at by the caucasian public they laughed at his broken english his marital problems and in later years his financial shortsightedness they laughed and soon their laughter began to have its effect on negroes what good is it they began to ask themselves if joe beats billy conn and conn winds up an oil millionaire while joe goes broke paying taxes what satisfaction is there in knowing that our joe is the most skilled ringman in the world if we must look askance at his naive behavior outside the ring their only consolation was the hope that some day the title would be held by a negro who was as wellschooled in the social graces as he was in pugilism i it was a long wait the short reigns of charles and walcott fighters who possessed many of louis flaws but few of his virtueshad to be endured next came the seemingly endless but really short era of marciano an outsider whose retirement was i little lamented by negroes finally the long awaited day arrived on a wintry night of november of floyd patterson descended messianically to fulfill the dreams of negro boxing fans perhaps many will accuse me of sacrilege for comparing the advent of patterson with that of the messiah but who can deny that he was a dream come true his soft polished voice revealed a command of language that was often used devastatingly against snide reporters what a joy he was to listen to on a sports interview show the fact that he didnt make the national bestdressed lists was proof that his taste in clothing leaned toward conservatism and negroes like most americans equate conservatism with dignity add to this the facts that he had a placid almost dull home life had never been photographed in a nightclub andwonders of wonderswas even reported to be saving his money and you have the picture of a sports figure the negro public should have immediately clasped to its breast the fact that it didnt left pattersons admirers bewildered and frustrated they asked the same questions that i asked at the beginning of this article but most of us were unwilling to dig for an answer at the time finally the article by mr young goaded me into launching a factfinding program i hope the answers ive come up with are satisfactory to the ones who failed to discover a similar incentive first it should be pointed out that louis and the negro boxers who preceded him were symbols they were looked upon as symbols of the last negro citadel that had been assaulted but not taken by caucasians the citadel of physical prowess in that era the negro had all but conceded the intellectual war because for each dunbar and hughes he pointed to the caucasian could cite dozens of his own kind that were equal if not better and each time the negro praised his dr drew or dr carver the caucasian would cluck disdainfully and match this claim with a multitude of einsteins comptons and millikans only a foolhardy few however would even dare to claim they ever had a fighter who surpassed joe louis but something happened during world war ii and immediately after it was something that would profoundly affect the status of boxers as well as all sports figures for suddenly the negro had a change of heart about giving up the intellectual war and thus launched an attack that would eventually move the struggle between black and white outside the sports arena and into the world of ideas the physical aspect of the struggle was being supplanted by the intellectual one which was perhaps a little less violent but certainly a great deal more intense in short the seeds that had been sown by the participants of the harlem renaissance began to bear fruit this meant that the negro no longer had to limit himself to one idol there were now so many in so many fields that he could choose fromwith little if any fear that they would be ignored or scoffed at by the caucasian public who was going to scoff at ralph bundles competence as a statesman when the world had bestowed upon him one of its highest honors and would anyone dare expose his lack of good taste by laughing at the writings of james baldwin or ralph ellison after the worlds most celebrated critics had acclaimed them no longer did the negro have to enter a theater with apprehension for instead of the uncle tomish performances he had been subjected to in the past he could now look forward to seeing stars like sidney poitier and sammy davis jr handling roles that were believable even in the sports world the negro found that he had to divide his loyalties among a host of brownskinned starsand all of them werent boxers either should he stay on channel and watch jimmy brown cavort on the pro football field or should he switch to channel and watch wilt chamberlain make shambles of the pro basketball record book should he root for elston howard and the yankees or should he stick with hank aaron and the braves in fact things were going so well for the negro sports fan that in many of them had been tempted to write and accuse the sportswriters of america of prejudice in selecting an all negro all american basketball team after all they reasoned they didnt want their children encouraged to brag about black supremacy it was into this climate of negro achievement that floyd patterson stepped in he had won the championship in hopes of filling a vacuum only to discover too late that it was already crowded it was like the cavalry arriving after the wagon train had been rescued by the infantry despite this however i still feel that the negro owes patterson something i view him as the heir to a position that for a long time was the only thing the negro could reach out and touch and say in this much we are supreme i realize that today the heavyweight boxing championship has been stripped of its importance and has outlived its usefulness as a symbol but is this really any reason for the negro to hold it in less esteem in britain as well as other european countries the monarchy was long ago deprived of its governing functions and yet it is retained for the simple reason that it reminds the people of the glory that once was theirs it is something they consider a part of their heritage and consequently should be preserved and cherished for a nation that is ashamed of its history is ashamed of itself and whether he likes it or not boxing has been an important part of the negros history but all of this will probably fall on deaf ears so i have resigned myself to a comer of each room and barbershop where i will be unable to hear the derisive remarks about floyd patterson my ears are good though and i know that sooner or later one of those remarks will reach them when this happens i know that i will not be able to keep myself from shouting but he was the champion the growing rebellion in the negro church by the rev mr charles h king startling statement was one of the slave codes in the state of mississippi and the year it was written was in today years later the negro minister is still facing the dilemmas of his profession though not a recipient of physical lashes he is increasingly feeling the lashes inflicted by his problems and is beginning to pay the cost the silver bluff baptist church organized in stands today as a monument of the original negro church in america organized by a negro rev j a goflin and located in aiken county south carolina it symbolizes the early desire of the negro to worship in a church of his own negro clergy now serve as spiritual leaders of over million people the baptists compose the largest segment of this number a consequence of the white baptist allowance for negro slaves to enter the ministry other denominations worked among the slaves in the name of christianity but the added incentive of following the negro clergy gave impetus to the denominational attraction towards the baptist with the exception of the above cited slave code of mississippi it is a paradox of history that even as slaves prior to the civil war negroes enjoyed full fellowship in the white churches of the south some due to extraordinary talents and gifts in preaching pastored these mixed fellowships robert e semple in his book the history of the baptist in virginia wrote mr thomas armstead pastored the portsmouth church in virginia until and resigned after his resignation the church declined greatly they then employed josiah bishop a black man of considerable talent to preach for them however soon he resigned because of some objection among the membership william lemmon a man of color was then chosen and served until his death several years later the negro minister currently pastoring over churches of all sizes and denominations today finds himself facing the problem experienced by josiah bishop now the problem is within his own church and among his own people some of these churches are baptist consisting of approximately members the omission here of other denominational problems is not meant to indicate that none exists on the contrary all negro churches in part are confronted with the fundamental dilemmas that are to be presented in this essay the baptist church and its clergy because of size and familiar church structure in negro life invites this appraisal of the dilemmas it presents the negro church is in the throes of a silent rebellion silent it is for no concerted voices are heard in many respects only the clergyman is able to recognize its movement the rebellion is undeniably clear to him for strangely enough it is exerted in his direction a recent seminar held for negro ministers at virginia union university brought to the forefront the basic unrest and insecurity faced by these men many of them from varying denominations related the tensions and internal conflicts that awaited their return the most interesting feature of the seminar was the sessions where problems were shared and solutions offered a stranger happening by chance upon these conversations would have concluded the gathering to be one of dictators planning to curtail insurrection in their respective countries this rebellion probably received its largest thrust in the years following world war ii prior to that time definite patterns were established that are primarily responsible for todays dilemmas to understand the negro church and its clergy an insight into the background of its leadership functions is necessary except in recent years churches required little of their minister in terms of education and training his role as a man of god was highlighted by his ability to arouse his listeners up to the pearly gates of heaven through vocal calisthenics deliberately calculated to provoke emotionalism he was able to hold them there his ability to do this beyond a questionable doubt served a very important need his emphasis was on the hereafter and the gospel that he preached was one of deliverance people suffering from the ills of segregation ill housing lack of opportunity and discrimination welcomed the therapeutic effect that this ministry gave them these ministers and the time that produced them rendered an invaluable service the release given people in the form of religion cast the ministers in the role of a practicing psychiatrist dr morris b tynes pastor of the monumental baptist church chicago in referring to this phenomenon stated if the negro had not been encouraged to shout on sunday he would be compelled by his tensions to shoot on monday this obvious exaggeration only points up the anxieties and frustrations that the ministry of the church succeeded in quelling and succeeded quite admirably such ministry produced the resulting transference towards the symbol of internal healing with little equivocation the negro clergyman held a secure grasp on the hearts of the people his voice was the medicine of hope and eventual deliverance this is not true today great social changes induced by the recent war found the negro making rapid transitions from his life of old employment multiplied managerial techniques and industrial procedures were found in defense factories and in the armed forces in effect the negro was freed from emotional frustrations to an awakening realization that the pearly white gates of heaven were nearer earth than first thought the minister was discovering that he faced each sunday an increasingly enlightened membership following the war the veterans gi bill of rights fha and other equators of progress gave to the negro church solid citizens who had etched a niche in the community of hope the inevitable consequences of this social evolution worked its way into throbbing church discontentment motivated by the antiquity of church dynamics and aggravated by the emotional overtones of the ministry a rebellion brewed within the form of this rebellion has many sides some rebels changed faiths which might account for the increasing negro pilgrimage towards catholicism others remained and developed their rebellion toward the negro clergy itself the rebellion is so quiet that even those who assist it are often unaware of its existence a cross section taken of the average negro congregation is revealing it constitutes a picture of dramatic evolution today the trumpeting voice of the clergy is unheard unless it relates itself to this change if not observed and heeded damaging consequences will be felt the tragic consequence brought about by this rebellion is that both people and clergy deny themselves of the full measure of honest religious experience the minister of the evolutionized church whose voice and philosophy are not cognizant of these changes underestimates the loss of his power churches are known to suffer this ministry only out of respect to his person no assumption is made that they are universally ineffective many in spite of the rebellion are serving remaining needs that shall later be discovered the ministers reluctance to surrender to change is understandable ego is its mainspring it must be remembered that the leadership and power structure of the negro community was formerly and admittedly in the hands of its ministers they spoke acted and listened in behalf of the people the pulpit was the launching pad for community thrust however they now find themselves victimized by the success of their efforts the brighter day that was promised is approaching within this same community are now found lawyers doctors labor leaders teachers collegians and many other competent and enlightened negroes these persons through education and specialization are now adequately serving the increasingly complex needs of the community the beleaguered minister now is haunted by the knowledge that the diminishing emotional characteristics of the church have left him with more sound than substance too late for change he clings to and treasures the few voices that respond to his call for old time religion some churches have become so evolutionized that those who give vent to their feelings through shouting become victims of glares of disgust many suggest that such actions are indicators of mental disturbances lord how far we have come the reasons for this radical change among churchgoers might be found in the progress of the negro himself the negro has achieved many of the rights formerly denied him to be sure he has not yet received full citizenship but his educational opportunities and achievements frequently have surpassed even his own dreams where once he peered hopefully into the swirling waters of democracy he now finds himself in the waters therefore the emotional holds of his religion have been released rightly or wrongly if the negro minister fails to recognize these factors or strives to maintain the multiplicity of tasks that were once his complete domain he strides into the teeth of the rebellion this silent rebellion within the church might be looked upon as the core of the national baptist convention inc conflict the seeds of division were sown in when the struggle for power and position divided it into opposing camps the progressive baptists newly organized in established their break on the claim that established leadership failed to respond to progress thus today baptists are faced with a threeheaded structure each contending for power and prestige these conventional separations offer the negro clergyman a frustrating look at his own congregation unrest dissatisfaction with procedure administrative weaknesses and the clinging vine of emotionalism constitute factors which have risen like yeast from local congregations to split the national bodies ministers who contend most fervently for change at the national level fail to realize they are only echoing the voices of their own congregations the congregations voice unlike his own is silent the blame for this failure of communication must be equally shared local congregations bewildered by the storms that erupt from their ministers at the national level have not recognized that the church itself created the tempest the silent conflict of pew and pulpit has found its catharsis in the conventions as the oldline negro christians make their departure through retirement and death they leave the negro church a mixed legacy it is this legacy that constitutes the dilemma facing todays minister who is fast discerning that he cannot escape his heritage the first problem facing the modern minister is the problem of preaching itself the negro church is a paradox even though the evolutionized church silently rebelled against the emotional service there remains the subconscious desire to experience it the minister who cannot arouse his listeners to occasional bursts of emotional experiences soon finds himself competing unwillingly with those who can these competitors who learned the oldtime art of preaching from their fathers are eagerly sought for revivals and special services the people demand that he make the bible alive exciting and emotional this is the evoluaonized voice crying out for the past whether subconsciously or consciously the desire is there soaring to the heights of rhetorical beauty and using the voice as a painter would splashing a canvas with bright colors the minister surrenders to the past and increases his own dilemma when the local pastor is unable to satisfy these retrogressive moods once again silent rebellion sets in unfortunately many churches do not know what they want from their minister in regards to preaching churches become seriously divided in respect to the character of the minister desired large followings are found on both extremes when a minister accepts a call to a church of this divided nature the groundwork for rebellion is already laid it is noted that the dilemma of how to preach is ofttimes more of a concern to him than what to preach those who apply themselves to the concern of how consequently make a hollow mockery of their own talent the tradition of the pastors anniversary likewise rears up out of the past as one of the seeds of insurrection its original purpose was to honor the pastor by awarding him additional finances to supplement his meager salary money raised by membership taxation were ceremoniously presented to him on this big day as an expression of appreciation seated before the congregation with all of the pomp and circumstances afforded royalty he graciously received their gifts the original purpose was considered both honest and necessary when we consider the internal changes already notedthe diminishing emotional factor and the loss of ministerial influence resulting from the silent rebellionthe existence of the pastors anniversary today places a question mark behind both its honesty and necessity ministers who have an understanding of the psychology of their people have attempted to eliminate this tradition and in its place to obtain wages adjusted to the time in which he lives a recent salary survey taken among all clergymen shockingly revealed how the negro church values its ministry other ministers have discontinued the pastors anniversary because of the hostilities that arise from those who disagree with its purpose finally it has an additional shortcoming in that it subjects the minister to a yearly straw vote as to his popularity probably the most distressing rebellion in the negro church is the one occasioned by the official board of the church baptist churches have two traditional spiritual offices those of pastor and deacon the original calling of the deacons as found in chapter six of acts was to assist the apostles in the care of the membership in order to free the latter for preaching and study even the early church experienced a rebellion among its membership the evolution of society welfare agencies and socialization have now taken from the church many of the tasks and responsibilities of caring for the individual with the exception of sick visitations which are unfailingly required by and of the pastors deacons have been left with little external responsibilities yet as officers of the church and seeking recognition as such they seek and have found administrative authority on par with the minister many churches conscientiously grant them this authority the dilemma posed by this grant is awesome for the minister realizes that authority without responsibility is catastrophic he is faced with allowing such conditions to exist or firming his own authoritative powers neither condition is healthy he finds himself in the position of having to work with these men of varied backgrounds with opinions and personalities to match the variations these men convinced by tradition and urged on by members vie with the minister for administrative leadership if the pastor possesses any degree of human frailty that is obvious to them they have the tendency to magnify it unfortunately in some churches such activity becomes the deacons sole raison detre as can be noted the consequences of this situation render both pastor and deacons ineffective for a full ministry in fact they have a tendency under these conditions to cancel each other out the apostles who initiated the deaconship would be horrified to learn that those who were called to help are actually watering the ground for the seeds of rebellion the minister is helpless to correct this situation without appearing autocratic an appeal to the people for release from this situation is useless after all the growth of the boards authority is the voice of their own rebellion facing the minister also are organizational structures and cliques which individually and collectively seek authoritative recognition and status circles and auxiliaries have created internal pastorates within their own groups and have successfully established a power structure add to this picture the members who deplore such infringements upon the church when the minister is unable or unwilling to challenge the trend of internal competing forces he is soundly blamed for allowing such conditions to exist thus the rebellion is complete facing the necessity of making choices in all these perplexing predicaments the minister recognizes that alternatives are equally conclusive against him however reflection upon his dilemma informs him that the integrity of his office and personality is at stake like paul two men war within him for the possession of his mind casting about in this religious sea the minister discovers the helm slipping from his grasp swirling around him are the angry waves of the rebellion and he realizes the old ship of zion is in peril unwilling to become a martyr to a cause that will not support itself through progress he wrestles with the desire to flee its consequences indeed ministers have been tempted to change professions for the maintenance of peace of mind the internal destructive elements in each crisis evokes additional terror to his very soul yet true to the code of the prophets many ministers hear the voice of god reminding them of responsibility and accountability as with the code of the sea the captain is the last to disembark from a sinking ship his primary responsibility is to the passengers it is here that we find the modern minister his position is not totally unbearable for he recognizes that he himself is a product of the ethnic centrifugal forces that are at work in the church he was born into the structure the ingrained and deeply rooted impulse that brought his religion to life cannot now by the same token be utilized to quiet the rebellion around him here he stands god help him he cannot do otherwise no other profession stands in such urgent need of solutions as that of the negro minister harking back to the code of mississippi in it can be seen that negro ministers are not yet free from its prophetic stricture free negroes or mulattoes for exercising the functions of a minister of the gospel on conviction may be punished by any number of lashes not exceeding on the bare back and shall pay the cost tootsie belle alaska by clinton clark bright summer sun y a lit the scene below as our little plane circled the village of flat alaska this nearly abandoned gold mining town lies midway between the yukon and kuskokwim rivers in an area of small mountains about miles w m southeast of nome gold dredges have thoroughly torn up the countryside making it anything but a place of scenic beauty two dredges still remained one of which was still in operation we set our wheels down on an old landing strip at the edge of town with a mild assortment of uncomplimentary remarks we swatted mosquitoes beyond number as we walked up a pathway through small timber to the village store where we inquired our way to our destination moments later we paused at the door of a small frame building alongside the door time had almost erased the letters which spelled the words tootsies tavern knocking on the door we were greeted by a little old lady who all of alaska knows and loves fighting her way over wilderness rivers and trails mrs martha crosby has forged her name on the pages of alaskan history her career has been a colorful one colorful in more ways than one for tootsie as she is known all over alaska is truly a colored lady black as night tootsie was born in maine in the daughter of joe and susannah mcelhaney next to the baby in a family of her father was a blacksmith after the death of her mother in mr and mrs j d wade who had been friends of the family talked her father into giving tootsie to them to raise i just want a little colored child for an ornament mrs wade said very wealthy the wades spent most of their time traveling he was connected with the united fruit company their travels took them to many of the latin american countries and everywhere they went little tootsie also went but the call of alaska reaches far and eventually they turned their backs on the southern climes attracted by tales of gold and adventure they landed in skagway on september traveling all over alaska and canadas yukon during the years that followed they found the adventure they sought tootsie last saw her foster parents in skagway in they left a large amount of money for her in the bank of commerce in dawson recalling her early life with them tootsie says no white child was ever raised better than i was returning to seattle that same year tootsie married a colored man who worked in a hotel but the next day when he went to work she somehow got the idea that he had run off with her sister and some others and she took out for chicago and never saw him again while on the train she gained the acquaintance of a lady who was en route to take a stage test as a dancer accompanying her new found friend to the rehearsal tootsies feet could not be still and she too started to dance the director said keep going keep going i thought he meant git out tootsie said so i was a gittin out the door and a gittin out fast then he said no no i meant keep dancing whered you learn to dance the director asked tootsie i dont know i guess i was just born that way did you ever hear of the amateur theater no well you go there thus began a year of stage dancing in chicago in accompanied by a colored girl friend tootsie returned to alaska and the two women started stage dancing in iditarod a small village only a few miles from flat but this life was too confining for tootsie so she quit the dancing bought a gasolinepowered boat and went into business hauling freight and passengers between iditarod on the iditarod river and marshall on the yukon river all up and down the rivers she was greeted by eskimos who would run to their friends shouting theres a black white woman in town once she was confronted by an eskimo who exclaimed how come you more blackern us yet you talk like white woman other eskimos rubbed her hands to see if the black would come off staying at a road house she sat at the supper table and was given a very scornful look by an eskimo across the table i don t like you you been here all day and you aint washed your face yet on one trip she took a group of passengers from marshall to kotlik at the mouth of the yukon to catch a steamship but on arrival at kotlik the captain of the steamer refused to accept her passengers he said we will give you all the passengers you want for st michael so she took more passengers and left for st michael despite their warning that they would not pay her if she did not get beyond romanof st michael is on norton sound across from nome just beyond romanof the little river boat got froze in and was marooned there until their food supplies were almost exhausted but patience won out and eventually they arrived at st michael on the return trip to kotlik they were caught in a storm and nearly sank when they left kotlik enroute to st michael one of tootsies crew members was told to bring back a supply of snuff and tobacco but he promptly forgot it on arrival back at kotlik tootsie faced a storm almost as bad as the one on the water one man told her i wish you had drowned weve been out of snuff for two weeks returning to iditarod tootsie opened a road house she cooked for to men alone days and days i never got a chance to go to bed she said handled whiskey too got pinched too in those days gold was the magic word in alaska when you heard of a strike within miles you just took your hat and a crust of bread and started right off across country the mail from outside was brought overland by dogteam road houses were few and far between they slept in the snow didnt carry no tent or nothin tootsie recalled they cooked mush on the trail for their dogs the prettiest thing in the world was to see the mail man a cornin with or dogs with their tails curled up and their little bells a ringin great big dogshuskies them was the kind of dogs to have i wouldnt have these little playthings they have now they cant haul nothin during the first world war tootsie boarded dogs in the summer time she averaged dogs and at one time she had she fed them on fish reindeer meat and meal

in a heart that loves the frozen north the only man on liberty street by william melvin kelley he was squatting in the s v front yard digging f with an old brass spoon in the dirt which was an ocean to the islands of short yellow grass she wore a red and white checkered dress which hung loosely from her shoulders and obscured her legs it was early spring and she was barefoot her toes stuck from under the skirt she could not see the man yet riding down liberty street his shoulders square the duster he wore spread back over the horses rump a carpetbag tied with a leather strap to his saddle horn and knocking against his leg she could not see him until he had dismounted and tied his horse to a small black iron negro jockey and unstrapped the bag she watched now as he opened the wooden gate came into the yard and stood looking down at her his face stern almost gray beneath the brim of his wide ha she knew him her mother called him mister herder and had told jennie that he was jennies father he was one of the men who came riding down liberty street in their fine black suits and starched shirts and large dark ties each of these men had a house to go to into which mostly in the evening he would disappear only women and children lived on liberty street all of them were negroes some of the women were quite dark but most were coffeecolor they were all very beautiful her mother was light she was tall had black eyes and black hair so long she could sit on it the man standing over her was the one who came to her house once or twice a week he was never there in the morning when jennie got up he was tall and thin and blond he had a short beard that looked as coarse as the grass beneath her feet his eyes were blue like jennies he did not speak english very well jennies mother had told her he came from across the sea and jennie often wondered if he went there between visits to their house jennie you ask your mother why i do not stay at night is so she looked up at him yes mister herder the hair under his jaw was not as light as that on his cheeks or on his head he nodded i stay now go and bring your mother she left the spoon in the dirt and ran into the house down the long hall dark now because she had been sitting in the sun she found her mother standing over the stove a great black lid in her left hand a wooden spoon in her right there were jewels of sweat on her forehead she wore a full black skirt and a white blouse her one waistlength braid hung straight between her shoulder blades she turned to jennies running steps mama that man my father he in the yard he brung a carpetbag first her mother smiled then frowned then looked puzzled a carpetbag darling yes mama she followed her mother through the house pausing with her at the hall mirror where the woman ran her hand up the back of her neck to smooth stray black hair then they went onto the porch where the man was now seated surveying the tiny yard and the dark green hedge that enclosed it the carpetbag rested beside his chair her mother stood with her hands beneath her apron staring at the bag mister herder he turned to them i will not go back this time no matter what why should i live in that house when i must come here to know what home is he nodded sharply as if in answer to a question so i stay i give her that house i will send her money but i stay here with you two so her mother stood silently for an instant then turned to the door dinnerll be on the table in a halfhour she opened the screen door the spring whined and cracked oh she let go the door and picked up the carpetbag ill tote this on up she went inside as she passed jennie could see she was smiling again after that jennies mother became a celebrity on liberty street the other women would stop her to ask about the man and he staying for good josie yes you have any trouble yet not yet well child you make him put that there house in your name you dont want to be no sissie markham that white woman come down the same day he died and moved she and her children right into the gutter you get that house put in your name you hear yes how is it it different her mother would look dazed yes it different he told me to call him maynard the other women were always very surprised at first jennie too was surprised the man was always there in the morning and sometimes even woke her up her mother no longer called him mister herder and at odd times though still quite seldom still said no she had never before heard her mother say no to anything the man ever said it was not long before jennie was convinced that he actually was her father she began to call him papa daily now a white woman had been driving by their house jennie did not know who she was or what she wanted but playing in the yard would see the white womans gray buggy turn the corner and come slowly down the block pulled by a speckled horse that trudged in the dry dust a negro driver sat erect in his black uniform a whip in his fist the white woman would peer at the house as if looking for an address or something special she would look at the curtained windows looking for someone and sometimes even at jennie the look was not kind or tender but hard and angry as if she knew something bad about the child then one day the buggy stopped the negro pulling gently on the reins the white woman leaned forward spoke to the driver and handed him a small pink envelop he jumped down opened the gate and without looking at jennie his face dark and shining advanced on the porch up the three steps which knocked hollow beneath his boots opened the screen door and twisted the polished brass bell key in the center of the open winter door her mother came drying her hands the negro reached out the envelop and her mother took it looking beyond him for an instant at the buggy and the white woman who returned her look coldly as the negro turned her mother opened the letter read it moving her lips slightly then jennie could see the wet twinkling at the corners of her eyes her mother stood framed in the black square of the doorway tall fair the black hair swept to hide her tears her eyes glistening jennie turned back to the white woman now and saw her lean further into her seat then suddenly she pulled forward do you understand what i will have them do she was shouting shrilly and spoke like jennies father you tell him he has got one wife you are something different she leaned back again waved her gloved hand and the buggy lurched down the street gained speed and jangled out of sight around the corner jennie was on her feet and pounding up the stairs mama go play jennie go on now play still her mother stared straight ahead as if the buggy and the white woman remained in front of the house she still held the letter as if to read it the corners of her eyes were twinkling and wet then she turned and went into the house the screen door clacked behind her at nights now jennie waited by the gate in the yard for her father to turn the corner walking in the beginning she had been waiting too for the one day he would not turn the corner but each night he came that day seemed less likely to come even so she was always surprised to see him when she saw him she would wave timidly raising her hand only to her shoulder wiggling only her fingers as if to wave too wildly would somehow cause the entire picture of him advancing to collapse as only a slight wind would be enough to disarrange a design of feathers that night too she waved and saw him raise his hand high over his head greeting her she backed away when he reached the gate so he might open it her head thrown way back looking up at him well my jennie what kind of day did you have she only smiled then remembered the white woman a white lady come to visit mama she come in a buggy and give her a letter too she made mama cry his smile fled he clicked his tongue angry now we go see what is wrong come he reached for her hand her mother was in the kitchen she looked as if she did not really care what she was doing or how walking from pump to stove stove to cupboard in a deep trance the pink envelope was on the table she turned to them her eyes were red several strands of hair stuck to her temples she cleared her nose and pointed to the letter she come today her father let go jennies hand picked up the letter and read it when he was finished he took it to the stove and dropped it into the flame there was a puff of smoke before he replaced the lid he shook his head she cannot make me go back josephine her mother fell heavily into a wooden chair beginning to cry again but she white maynard he raised his eyebrows like a priest or a displeased school teacher your skin is whiter my mother was a slave he threw up his hands making fists your mother did not ask to be a slave then he went to her crouched on his haunches befor her speaking quietly no one can make me go back but she can get them to do what she say she turned her gaze on jennie but looked away quickly you wasnt here after the war but i seen things i seen things happen to field niggers that i was up in the house they didnt bother me my own father the general he stood on a platform in the center of town and promised to keep the niggers down i was close by she took his face in her hands maynard maybe you better get on back leastways i go backdead you hear dead these children these cowardly children in their masks will not move me i go back dead that is all we do not discuss it and he was gone jennie heard him thundering down the hall knocking against the table near the stairs pounding up to the second floor her mother was looking at her now her eyes even more red than before her lips trembling her hands active in her lap jennie yes mama she took a step toward her staring into the womans eyes jennie i want you to promise me something and not forget it yes mama she was between her mothers knees felt the womans hands clutching her shoulders jennie youll be right pretty when you get grown did you know that promise me youll go up north promise me if im not here when you get eighteen youll go north and get married you understand jennie was not sure she did she could not picture the north except that she had heard once it was cold and white things fell from the sky she could not picture being eighteen and her mother not being there but she knew her mother wanted her to understand and she lied yes mama repeat what i just said she did her mother kissed her mouth hard the first time ever from the kitchen below their voices came her fathers voice sounded hard cut short jennie knew he had made a decision and was sticking to it her mother was pleading trying to change his mind it was july the fourth the day of the shooting match she dressed in her sunday clothes and coming downstairs heard her mother maynard please dont take her she was frantic now im begging you dont take that child with you today i take her we do not discuss it i take her those sneaking cowards in their masks jennie knew now what they were talking about her father had promised to take her to the shooting match for some reason her mother feared there would be trouble if jennie went downtown she did not know why her mother felt that way except that it might have something to do with the white woman who continued to ride by their house each morning after her father had left for the day perhaps her mother did not want to be alone in the house when the white woman drove by in her gray buggy even though she had not stopped the buggy since the day two months ago when the negro had given her mother the pink envelope but other strange things had happened after that in the beginning she and her mother as always before had gone downtown to the market to shop amid the bright stalls brimming with green and yellow vegetables and brickred meats tended by dark country negroes in gay clothes and large straw hats it would get very quiet when they passed and jennie would see the negroes look away fear in their eyes and knots of white men watching sometimes giggling but the white women in fine clothes were the most frightening sitting on the verandas or passing in carriages some even coming to their windows they would stare angrily as if her mother had done something terrible to each one personally as if all these white women could be the one who drove by each morning her mother would walk through it all her back straight very like her fathers the bun into which she wove her waistlength braid on market days gleaming dark in the beginning they had gone to the suddenly quiet market but now her mother hardly set foot from the house and food was brought to them in a carton by a crippled negro boy who was coming just as jennie and her father left the house that morning balancing the carton on his left arm he removed his ragged hat and smiled morning mister herder good luck at the shooting match sir his left leg was short and he seemed to tilt her father nodded thank you henry i do my best then you a sure thing mister herder he replaced his hat and went on around the house walking her hand in her fathers jennie could see some of the women of liberty street peering out at them through their curtains downtown was not the same flags and banners draped the verandas people wore their best clothes the square had been roped off a platform set up to one side and new marsails avenue which ran into the square had been cleared for two blocks far away down the avenue stood a row of cotton bales onto which had been pinned oilcloth targets from where they stood the bullseyes looked no bigger than red jawbreakers many men slapped her father on the back and furtively looked at her with a kind of clinical interest but mostly they ignored her the celebrity of the day was her father and unlike her mother he was very popular everyone felt sure he would win the match he was the best shot in the state after everyone shot the judge came running down from the targets waving his arms maynard herder six shots and you can cover them all with a good gob of spit he grabbed her fathers elbow and pulled him toward the platform where an old man with white beard wearing a gray uniform trimmed with yellow waited she followed them to the platform steps but was afraid to go any further because now some women had begun to look at her as they had at her mother the old man made a short speech his voice deep but coarse grainysounding and gave her father a silver medal in a blue velvet box her father turned and smiled at her she started up the steps toward him but just then the old man put his hand on her fathers shoulder people had begun to walk away down the streets leading out of the square there was less noise now but she could not hear the first words the old man said to her father her fathers face tightened into the same look she had seen the day the letter came the same as this morning in the kitchen she went halfway up the stairs stopped the old man went on you know im no meddler everybody knows about liberty street i had a woman down there myself before the war i know that the words came out of her fathers face though his lips did not move the old man nodded but maynard what youre doing is different shes your own daughter maybe thats why the old man looked down the street toward the cotton bales and the targets but shes a nigger and now the talk is taking an ugly turn and the folks talking are the ones i cant hold her father spoke in an angry whisper you see what i do to that target you tell those children in their masks i do that to the forehead of any man or woman that comes near her or my house you tell them maynard that wouldnt do any real good after theyd done something to her he stopped looked at jennie and smiled thats my only granddaughter you know his eyes clicked off her youre a man who knows firearms youre a gunsmith i know firearms too pistols and rifles can do lots of things but they dont make very good doctors nobodys asking you to give her up just go back home thats all go back to your wife her father turned away walking fast came down the stairs and grabbed her hand his face was red as blood between the white of his collar and the straw yellow of his hair they slowed after a block paused in a small park with green trees shading several benches and a statue of a sternfaced young man in uniform carrying pack and rifle we will sit she squirmed up onto the bench beside him he was quiet for a long while the warm wind smelled of salt from the gulf the leaves were a dull low tambourine finally he sighed leaned forward to get up but first thrust the blue velvet box into her hand it was cool and almost prickly i give it to you it is yours always remember i give it to you he stood now you must go home tell your mother come later that night jennie tried to stay awake until he came home until he was there to kiss her goodnight his whiskers scratching her cheek but all at once there was sun at her window and the sound of carts and wagons grating outside in the dirt street her mother was quiet while the two of them ate after breakfast jennie went into the yard to wait for the gray buggy to turn the corner but for the first morning in many months the white woman did not jounce by peering at the house searching for someone nr something special by walter monfried erdition catch my p soul but i do love thee fetch me the handkerchief v beware my lord of jealousy it is the greeneyed monster then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well the gorgeous rhetoric and fearful tension of shakespeares othello the moor of venice have enthralled three and a half centuries of players and audiences the worlds finest actors have delighted in the challenges of the roles of the bighearted gullible othello and the malicious iago theatergoers find it particularly satisfying when a negro portrays the harassed moor it certainly is the greatest role ever written for an african in the s paul robeson played othello with jose ferrer as iago for several prosperous seasons in the s william marshall headed the brattle troupe of cambridge mass which took othello to new york ira aldridge the eminent th century american actor is often called the first negro to play othello but this is not quite correct when aldridge was a boy in new york james hewlett and several fellow players organized the african company which staged othello and other shakespeare plays there was quite a movement for drama and general education among new york negroes in those days when george washington was president the african free school was established even before a free school for white children was available ira aldridge probably was graduated from that school and from the hewlett company the facts pertaining to his early career are obscure a candidate for an advanced degree in theater history could write a valuable book about him if he or she were willing to undertake long research ira was born about his grandfather was said to have been chief of a senegalese tribe who was assassinated by his subjects for advocating an exchange of prisoners the kings son daniel escaped with the aid of an american missionary and made his way to new york eventually daniel became pastor of a new york congregation and sent his son ira to schenectady n y to prepare for the ministry but the boy had developed a taste for the theater from his school activities and soon returned to new york to take backstage jobs when ira was and working as a stage carpenter he was befriended by a man of influence some historians believe that the friend was the greatest english ac tor of his time edmund kean who was acting in new york around others assert that the benefactor was james wallach a prominent manager of new york and london theaters at any rate aldridge was taken to london and presented in othello when he was only the critics and paying customers received him so favorably that he was starred in the theaters of the capital and of the provinces for many years he was frequently billed as the african roscius roscius was a slave who become the most famous actor of ancient rome and incidentally a millionaire aldridge himself was never a slave and strangely he never acted in the united states as a mature professional he came back to new york a time or two but never could make a satisfactory deal with the managers actually his european successes were more than sufficient he was rapturously received not only as othello but as lear macbeth hamlet shylock and richard iii just about the greatest characters ever created by shakespeare he also starred in plays that are almost forgotten now pizarro the revenge the slave the padlock and others he revived one of shakespeares lesser plays titus adronicus so that he could take the role of aaron the moor his othello remained his best role however and it was unmatched anywhere at that time the journalists reported that the audiences wept shouted and shuddered at his interpretation maria malibran a great singing actress of opera declared never in the whole course of my professional career have i witnessed a more powerful and interesting performance after one performance a leading english playwright sheridan knowles rushed up to him flung his arms about the actor and shouted for the honor of the human race let me embrace you the reception of the american on the european continent was equally ecstatic one of his admirers was the greatest of german opera composers richard wagner who had a prodigious knowledge of theater in general he wrote a friend for your attention wednesday othello with ira aldridge tickets should be secured early in those continental performances aldridge spoke english and the other actors used the language of the particular nation in which they appeared evidently an understanding of his speech was not necessary at a berlin performance the german actress playing desdemona became so alarmed that she screamed and ran from the stage wherever he went aldridge was a box office magnet an announcement of his forthcoming appearance resulted in an advance sale of many thousands of tickets he played for five solid months in berlin and received a week plus expensesan enormous stipend for that era he received decorations and honorary orders from kings dukes and other nobles the king of prussia this before the united german empire was formed awarded him the national gold medal of science and art only three celebrities had received it previously humboldt the naturalist spontini the composer and liszt the pianistcomposer aldridge became a british citizen and made his home in upper norwood his villa there was literally crammed with gifts and decorations a visiting reporter observed a leading french author and critic theophile gautier considered aldridge the finest actor of the midth century he saw aldridge in russia and wrote he was the lion of st petersburg now leningrad it was necessary to engage seats far in advance his entrance as othello was magnificent the frenchman continued with his eyes half closed as if dazzled by the african sun he was othello himself he had that nonchalance that oriental attitude that freedom of movement possessed by a negro which no european can imitate he created an immense effect and received endless applause after his first performance in st petersburg the theatergoers unhitched his horses and pulled his carriage through the streets gautier considered aldridges lear even better than his othello white paint covered his cheeks and a thick white beard enveloped the rest of his face even his fellow players could not have guessed he was a negro although he was at the height of his physical power he did not betray by a single movement that he was a younger man his voice step and gestures were all those of an english king years old many other critics wrote of him with equal enthusiasm a reviewer in the large polish port city of danzig called him the greatest dramatic artist we have ever seen a vienna journalist declared that aldridge is without doubt the greatest actor that has ever been seen in europethis in vienna a traditionally great center of theatrical activity aldridge was twice married his first wife a wealthy english woman had met him when she went backstage tc congratulate him after her death he married a swedish countess amanda pauline brandt three children were born to them their daughter amanda studied singing under the immortal jenny lind the swedish nightingale and became a prominent voice teacher in london among her pupils were the famous american negro singers robeson and roland hayes aldridge died in lodz poland in his early sixties he was stricken by a heart attack just as he was winding up his european tour and preparing to make a tour of his native landa land never privileged to see him act a forgotten page of history by gene d matlock n august a dutch manofwar anchored off the coast of virginia twenty frightened sick negroes were pulled out of the steaming hold and quickly rowed to shore they were the first african slaves sold in english america the captain mistakenly believed that slaves were his only cargo he had no barrels of rum no agricultural tools no bolts of cloth to put off the negroes carried no baggage they had left all the material manifestations of their culture in africa what the captain didnt know is that a secondary cargo had been secretly stowed away on the shipa cargo that was locked in the minds of all the slaves it was composed of human ideas and traditions one of the stowaways was the african belief that slavery was a natural state of affairs since time immemorial the african negroes had been enslaving each other in fact the new world negroes had been run down and sold to the europeans by some of their own people a few of the newlyarrived slaves had themselves owned slaves in africa therefore it should come as no surprise to know that barely fifty years after the first negroes touched the coast of virginia a few managed to free themselves and become the masters instead of the mastered until now the history of the negros role as slave master has been largely neglected in this country it hasnt been for lack of material evidence the archives of our country contain abundant references to this practiceenough to keep researchers busy for years there are three main reasons why the public has not been made conscious of this little known sidelight on american history first the original writers on the subject said that most of the colored slave masters became such for philanthropic reasonsin order to free or protect their own people it is true that many negro freedmen owned members of their own families such as wives children and parents however in this authors opinion personal emotional motives rather than genuine philanthropy inspired the purchase of close relatives the records prove that few freedmen manumitted slaves outside the immediate family circle there are only a few instances of genuine philanthropy among negro freedmen john barry meachum a negro baptist minister who lived in the early th century purchased negroes and allowed them to earn their freedom on liberal terms in samuel gibson a mississippi negro took his six slaves to cincinnati ohio and settled them on free territory however such philanthropy was rare not enough to release the american negro from his share of guilt the truth is that an uncomfortable percentage of free negroes hungered for property in slaves they bought as many as they could afford and acquired a reputation as hard frugal efficient task masters other historians have wrongly exaggerated the importance of the old laws restricting freedmen on the books they were quite oppressive it appeared that the freedmen could acquire true freedom only by going north in florida their lot was so intolerable that many asked to be returned to slavery however in most slave states the laws against freedmen were intolerable only in theorynot in actual practice they were drawn up to provide legal ground for the whites in case the freedmen got out of hand such laws generally made life impossible for vagrants and the unemployed before the outbreak of the civil war more than fifty per cent of all free negroes lived in the south those who were skilled in the trades or had other special talents had more work than they could handle arkansas and florida appear to be the only states where private enterprise among the negroes was seriously curtailed even so some negroes in those states managed to buy and hold property in their own people others have discounted the importance of negro slaveholding on the grounds that relatively few of them owned slaves in comparison with the whites this is true however the fact that they did it when able and that several of the largest slaveholders in the old south were negroes proves that many american negroes had an appetite for slaveholding and enthusiastically contributed to its perpetuation many negroes used to sit on the spacious porches of their luxurious plantation homes drinking mint juleps and watching their slaves toil endlessly under the blistering southern sun such masters acquired good educations sent their children to the best european schools and went north not to escape but to vacation and purchase items for their plantations in a journey in the seaboard slave states frederick olmstead wrote an intelligent man whom i met at washington who had been travelling most of the time for two years in the planting districts of louisiana having business with planters told me the free negroes of the state in general so far as he had observed were just equal in all respects to the white creoles there were many opulent intelligent and educated the best houses and most tasteful grounds that he had visited in the state belong to a nearly fullblooded negroa very dark man he and his family are well educated and though french is their habitual tongue they speak english with freedom and one of them with much more elegance than most liberally educated whites in the south they had a private tutor in their family as stated at the beginning of this article some negroes freed themselves and acquired slaves just a few decades after their arrival in the new world about the middle of the th century several negroes had become free owners of land there was at least one who owned a negro servant who went to court for his freedom he was turned down because he could not produce the indenture that he claimed to have in his possession one of the first notations in the deed books of st augustine florida is that of joseph sanchez a colored carpenter he sold francisco p sanchez a negro slave for the connecticut historical society has in its files at hartford connecticut a bill of sale from samuel stanton of stonington connecticut dated october to prince a free negro born of a slave woman named binar on the other side is a bill of sale from prince to isaac denison stonington august of the same binar a slave according to the records most free negroes as soon as they acquired sufficient money purchased mates and other close relatives many of the negro husbands who bought wives did not liberate them immediately they preferred to put them on trial for a few years if they proved to be unsatisfactory they were sold proof that not all the free negroes were philanthropic is the wealth of cases where members of the family were sold for profit by their own children or parents c d wilson in an article about negro slaveholders negroes who owned slaves popular science monthly nov tells the story of a free negro named jacob who managed to purchase his father at a reasonable price all went smoothly for a while until one day his father scolded him he was so angered that he sold his father to a negro speculator the trader sent his father south young jacob afterward boasted that the old man had gone to the corn fields about new orleans where they might learn him some manners the negro slaveholders acquired their status by inheritance through white relatives by gifts and by purchase after the manner of their caucasian neighbors some negro tradesmen and businessmen accepted property in slaves as payment for services rendered in antoine robert robin de longy contracted a free mulatto to build the famous mansion destrehan now owned by the panamerican oil co it is one of the oldest houses in louisiana the terms of the contract read as follows robert antoine de longy and charles free mulatto have agreed that the said charles carpenter woodworker and mason by his trade obligates himself to construct a home of sixty feet in length by thirtyfive feet in width for the sums and price mentioned hereafter one brute negro with a cow and her calf fifty quarts of rice in chaff fifty quarts of com in husks and one hundred piastras term applied to the dollar the negro masters owned generally from one to a dozen slaves others ruled the lives of to more than men women and children negro slave owners were to be found in all the colonies or states where slaves were kept in many counties the negro masters were numerous in others they were unknown olmstead in a journey described places in louisiana where white slaveholders were the minority there are also in the vicinity a large number of free colored planters in going down cane river the dalmau called at several of their plantations to take on cotton and the captain told me that in fifteen miles below natchitoches he did not know but one pureblooded white man the plantations appeared no way different from the generality of those of the white creoles and on some of them were large handsome and comfortable houses these free colored people are all descended from the progeny of old french or spanish planters and their negro slaves such a progeny born before louisiana was annexed to the united states and the descendants of it are entitled to freedom wilson in his investigations received the following letter from the hon phanor breazeale of natchitoches louisiana assuming that the records of the parish are a fair criterion by which to judge the other old parishes of the state it was not an uncommon feature of slavery to find that free blacks owned slaves but on the contrary there were prior to the war quite a number of free colored people as they were called who were owners of slaves some of these free colored people in this parish were quite wealthy the records here disclose sales to and from free colored people of slaves i do not recall any instances in examining the records of having found a case where a free black owner voluntarily manumitted his slaves as a matter of interest in studying this phase of slavery i have found by inquiry from old people that free black owners were as a usual thing much more severe on their slaves than the white owners mr d c scarborough of natchitoches wrote wilson the truth of the matter is that free blacks owned bought and sold slaves as did the whites the succession of c n roques in this parish is a case in which a free black owned some hundred or so slaves all of whom were freed by the proclamation of emancipation melrose plantation near natchitoches la was founded by a congolese negress named marie therese coin coin marie was brought to america when she was a small child upon the death of her master she was freed and awarded a large grant of land by the french government the beginnings of her fortune were derived from the forest lands on the plantation after the supply of suitable trees was exhausted she turned to the soil her haitian husband augustin metoyer was a leading slaveholder and philanthropist in the natchitoches community augustin and marie owned more than a hundred slaves and helped the poor people who lived on the banks of the cane river one of augustins gifts to the community was a church on isle breville across the river it is still in use augustins food was served on expensive china he slept on a large four poster bed all of his children had personal servants and his wife managed a large group of maids and houseboys the plantation house melrose manor is now a famous tourist attraction and haven for artists it is in excellent condition and is said to be one of the most beautiful plantation homes in the south it was built by augustins grandson louis metoyer jr in the first half of the th century there were many negro slaveholders in the natchitoches area their descendants live there still many on the same lands that were owned by their slaveowning grandfathers the homes of many natchitoches colored people contain priceless relics and memoirs of their illustrious ancestorsof a day when negroes owned negroes the following extract from the plaquemine louisiana sentinel tells the story of a rich negro who did not know the meaning of philanthropy a wealthy negro family an immense estate in louisiana embracing over four thousand acres of land with two hundred and fifty negroes belonging to the plantation was recently sold for a quarter of a million dollars the purchaser was a free negro who is said to be one of the wealthiest men of the south the above is from a new york paper and refers to the harrison property which was purchased by cyprian ricaud a free man of color of our parish if the property had contained as many acres as stated above and as many slaves it would have brought nearer a million and a quarter than a quarter of a million on the contrary the land we believe comprised some sixteen hundred acres and there were about one hundred slaves of all sizes it lies in the rear of madame ricauds plantation and the two plantations now owned by that family probably do comprise the number of acres of land and slaves as above stated making them doubtless the richest black family in this or any other country the accusation that the black hand of the black master was the crudest was frequently heard throughout the south olmstead in the cotton kingdom wrote a negro with whom the author was talking in that regionin answer to further inquiries said that there were many free negroes all about this region some were very rich he pointed out to me three plantations within twenty miles owned by colored men these bought black folks he said and had servants of their own they were bad masters very hard and cruelhadnt any feeling you might think master dat dey would be good to dar own nation but dey is not i will tell you de truth massa i know ise got to answer and its a fact dey is very bad masters sar id rather be a servant to any man in de world dan to a brack man if i was sold to a brack man id drown myself dough i shouldnt like to do dat nudder but i wouldnt be sold to a colored master for anything this writer does not believe that the bulk of black masters were as cruel as the whites and negroes of that time declared slaves were a valuable investment the free negroes had to make more sacrifices to acquire slaves than the whites did like all property owners they were probably anxious to protect and increase their investments the whites naturally would have been shocked to see a negro punishing another negro as had to be done occasionally as is the case with slavery it was necessary for the masters even black masters to be harsh with their erring servants many prejudiced whites who wanted proof that nigger would out everytime naturally searched for traces of savagery in the freedmen it was probably damaging to a negros vanity to have to be the slave of someone of his own kind prestige factors were probably involved the observation of a northern traveler in texas before the civil war printed in the journal of negro history vol pg intimated the real reason why negroes hated to be owned by members of their own race at another house where we stopped we heard some conversation upon a negro of the neighborhood who had been sold to a free negro and who refused to live with him saying he wouldnt be a servant to a nigger some observers have however written that there were many kind negro slave owners c d wilson wrote mr stevenson archer of mississippi states that he knew a pureblooded negro born free by name nori a corruption of le noir who had before the civil war a large plantation in mississippi and owned about one hundred negroes he was exacting but not cruel and he took excellent care of his slaves such a master was william johnson a rich negro slave owner of natchez mississippithe famous barber of natchez in his diary he writes of a beating he administered to one of his slaves steven got drunk last night and went off and remained all night and was not here this morning to go to market i sent bill nix to the jail to see if he was there and he was not there i then sent him out to dr obdons and in going there he found him and brought him down and left him in the gate and he jumped over the fence and went threw in judge montgomerys yard bill he ran around the corner and found him and brought him in i kept him in the shop a little while and then sent him to the house belonging to bill hazard he ran off times in about three hours and bill nix caught him every time so he brought him home after a while and i went to the stable and gave him a pretty sefveere thrashing with the cow hidethen he was perfectly calm and quite and could then do his work tis singular how much good it does some people to get whiped steven got so bad that johnson was finally forced to sell him south although they never attained the same social status as their white contemporaries most of the successful freedmen were accepted as nearequals william johnson the famous barberbusinessman of natchez was respected by all the whites of that city when he was killed the local newspapers eulogized him the news of his death was talked about as far away as new orleans regardless of the restrictions upon them negro freedmen were usually treated fairly in business and in the courts an example of their right to get the protection of the courts is the following will and testament of a negro freedman from caroline county maryland last will and testament of ricksum webb negro recorded in will record waf no a fol et sq directs that my servant jerry shall serve my son james for the period of ten years after death of testator and then to be free to be given fifty dollars a year during this service and suitable clothing should jerry abscond from service and be taken to be sold for life to the highest bidder in lieu of this service to be sold to a resident of maryland for not less than for a period of ten years and then to be free said jerry to have choice of purchasers servant luke willed to soninlaw eben hughes servant asbury to be free at age of years girl servant ann to be free at age of james turner of queen annes executor will dated may proven th march before william a ford register of wills for caroline county when president lincoln signed his famous emancipation proclamation he reduced many colored freedmen to poverty along with the white slaveholders the negro slaveholders even more than the whites hated to see the end of slavery they knew that once the slaves were free they would be sucked down into the black maelstromand lose all their status the negro slaveowners knew that they could preserve their dignity only while slavery remained an institution in the south abolition was repugnant and unthinkable to them therefore most of the slaveowning freedmen refused to surrender their property in human beings instead they rallied to the cause of the confederacy a group of colored proprietors who owned slaves as a production investment sent a joint communications to the new orleans daily delta dec when secession and war were impending the free colored population native of louisiana own slaves and they are dearly attached to their native land and they are ready to shed their blood for her defence they have no sympathy for abolitionism no love for the north but they have plenty for louisiana in e s dargan forwarded to george w randolph confederate secretary of war the following letter from g huggins cleveland of mobile sir i can raise a battalion of regiment of creoles who are mixed blooded they are mostly property holders owning slaves and a peaceable orderly class and capable of doing good service they are as true to the south as the pure white race after the war was over slavery was snuffed out in the united states the negro masters reluctantly freed their slaves worked their lands themselves or looked negro digest march for other occupationsand sank into tragic obscurity wilson wrote of a colored man named dubroca who lived until near mobile alabama who had been the owner of numerous slaves not long before his death a white acquaintance met him on the streets and asked him how he felt he replied o i am feeling poorly i am getting old they all tell me it was a good thing to free the negroes but i wish i had my niggers back once more wilson also wrote of a negro named james fitzgerald who grieved himself to death over the results of the war by which he lost his slaves the ownership of slaves wasnt the only heights that free negroes attained in the slave states many writers like to impress us with accounts of the negroes progress in the last hundred years or so in this writers opinion the story of negro progress in a slave environment is much more impressive the mystery of how so many thousands of slaves could have thrown off the shackles of bondage rising head and shoulders above both races in a society designed to smother not nurture negro individuality is a phenomenon that defies belief not only did many become rich planters and slaveholders but there were doctors architects businessmen clergymen poets writers artists and skilled tradesmen among them the free negroes of new orleans during the antebellum period attained the highest degree of financial success and the highest level of general culture attained by a similar racial group anywhere in the world the amazing history of the progress of the american negro in the slave states is a super american success story making horatio alger appear weak lifeless and lacking in ambition it is an immortal national epic that preaches a dramatic message not only to the whites and negroes of america but to all the peoples of the world the fact that the spirit of free enterprise and personal achievement cropped up in the negroes in spite of all efforts to keep it suppressed and that previously enslaved men and women rose to dizzy heights proves that the desire for individual achievement is as fundamental as hunger and thirst the freedmen showed the world that there is something indomitable about the mortal yearning and striving for individual achievement their dusky faces staring out at us from the pages of history the old court records and what remains of their plantation homes are testimony to what men can do if they possess sufficient energy and determination while their role as slaveholders was deplorable the energy and sacrifice it took to acquire them are badly needed ingredients in modern society they also proved that a race that can surmount such tremendous obstacles may be a lot of the things people say it isbut inferior it aint before the mayflower by lerone bennett jr came out of a violent storm with a story no one bes v lieved a name no one recorded and a past no one investi gated she was manned by pirates and thieves her captain vs cd was a mystery man named jope her pilot an englishman named marmaduke her cargo an assortment of africans with sonorous spanish namesantony isabella pedro a year before the arrival of the celebrated mayflower years before the birth of george washington years before the signing of the emancipation proclamation this ship sailed into the harbor at jamestown virginia and dropped anchor into the muddy waters of history it was clear to the men who received this dutch man of war that she was no ordinary vessel what seems unusual today is that no one sensed how extraordinary she really was few ships before or since have unloaded a more momentous cargo from whence did this ship come from somewhere on the high seas where she robbed a spanish vessel of a cargo of africans bound for the west indies why did she stop at jamestown the first permanent english settlement in america no one knows for sure the captain ptended john rolfe noted that he was in great need of food he offered to exchange his human cargo for victualle the deal was arranged antony isabella pedro and other africans stepped ashore in august the history of the negro in america began it began in a way with antony and it began with a love story antony who had no surname fell in love with isabella and married her isabella in gave birth to the first negro child born in english america the proud parents named the boy william tucker in honor of a local planter there were other ships other william tuckers other antonys and other isabellasmillions after millions this is a story about those millions and the way they came to the americas this is a story about the merchandising and marketing of human beings this is a story about the greatest migration in recorded history the story of antony and isabella is only an act in a larger drama the european slave tradewhich began in and continued for more than years during this period africa lost an estimated lorty million people some twenty million of these men and women came to the new world millions more died in africa during and after their capture or on the ships and plantations these figures though instructive do not say anything meaningful about the people involved the slave trade was not a statistic however astronomical the slave trade was people living lying stealing mur dering and dying the slave trade was a black man who stepped out of his hut for a breath of fresh air and ended up ten months later in georgia with bruises on his back and a brand on his chest the slave trade was a black mother suffocating her newborn baby because she didnt want him to grow up a slave the slave trade was a kind captain forcing his suicideminded passengers to eat by breaking their teeth though as he said he was naturally compassionate the slave trade was a bishop sitting on an ivory chair on a wharf in the congo and extending his fat hand in wholesale baptism of slaves who were rowed beneath him going in chains to the slave ships the slave trade was a greedy king raiding his own villages to get slaves to buy brandy the slave trade was a pious captain holding prayer services twice a day on his slave ship and writing later the famous hymn how sweet the name of jesus sounds the slave trade was deserted villages bleached bones on slave trails and people with no last names the slave trade was caesar negro angelo negro and negro mary above all the slave trade was captain tomba who came to america and nealee who didnt nealee started out but she couldnt or wouldnt make it she was being driven to the west african coast for sale when she became ill and refused to walk another step mungo park who was one of the last persons to see nealee said she was put on an ass but the ass was so very unruly that no sort of treatment could induce him to proceed with his load and as nealee made no exertion to prevent herself from falling she was quickly thrown off and had one of her legs much bruised every attempt to carry her forward being thus found ineffectual the general cry of the coffle slave caravan was kangtegi kangtegi cut her throat cut her throat an operation i did not wish to see performed and therefore marched onwards with the foremost of the coffle i had not walked above a mile when one of karfas the leader domestic slaves came up to me with poor nealees garment upon the end of his bow and exclaimed nealee affeeleetanealee is lost i asked him whether the slatees black slave merchants had given him the garment as a reward for cutting her throat he replied that karfa and the schoolmaster would not consent to that measure but had left her on the road where undoubtedly she soon perished and was probably devoured by wild beasts captain tomba who came to america was first seen in a slave pen in sierra leone john atkins a surgeon who saw him there said he was a handsome man who scorned looking at us refusing to rise or stretch out his limbs as the master commanded a few days later captain tomba and a companion led a revolt on a slave ship and killed three sailors before they were subdued what happened to captain tomba why says john atkins captain harding weighing the stoutness and worth of the two slaves captain tomba and a companion did as in other countries they do by rogues of dignity whip and scarify them only while three others abettors but not actors nor of strength for it he sentenced to cruel deaths making them first eat the heart and liver of one of them killed the woman he hoisted up by the thumbs whipped and slashed her with knives before the other slaves till she died captain tomba living nealee dying john newton praying the king of barsally stealing the fat bishop baptizing captain harding torturing these people and millions like them made the slave trade one of the darkest chapters in the history of man this dark chapter started in the fifteenth century but in truth it goes back to the dawn of history slavery in one form or another has been practiced in every country known to man it was old when moses was young in platos athens and caesars rome menwhite black and brown menwere bought and sold slavery existed in the middle ages in christian europe and in pagan africa in the ancient world almost anyone might become a slave slavery was so prevalent in fact that it was not considered a badge of shame the israelites milton r konvitz reminds us in the promised land did not consider it a badge of shame that their forefathers had been slaves unto pharaoh in egypt on the contrary they were commanded to hold ever in their consciousness not only the fact that they had been led out of their bondage in egypt but also and with equal importance that before the exodus they had been slaves slavery then like alienage could serve as a bond to humanity the experience of slavery in the ancient world was so common that plato ventured to suggest that every man has many slaves among his ancestors ciceros letter to atticus forms a curious comment on the changing fashions in race do not obtain your slaves from britain he wrote because they are so stupid and so utterly incapable of being taught that they are not fit to form part of the household of athens a charming story which revolves around this letter was recounted by the distinguished britisher sir william hamilton fyfe the incident he said happened in sierra leone a lecture had been arranged and the lecturer took the line that the weight and structure of an africans brain was such that it was quite incapable of being developed by higher education he thought his audience was wholly european but when the time for questions came at the end there rose at the back of the hall a tall ebony figure with that wide and winning african smile it was one of the members of the staff of the old and famous missionary college at fourah bay he thanked the lecturer very kindly for his interesting talk and he said you know it reminded me of what i happened to be reading last night in a volume of ciceros letters it was a letter that was written by cicero to his friend atticus the millionaire employer of slave labour and he says in the letter that of all his slaves the british were the ugliest and most stupid and then he added ingratiatingly how you have come on and with that he sat down there was a crucial difference between ancient slavery and modern slavery ancient slavery which had little or nothing to do with race was justified primarily by the rules of war christians and moslems added a new dimension to this ancient institution members of each faith historian kenneth m stampp writes looked upon the other as infidels and hence felt doubly entitled to make slaves of the other when taken as captives moors captured in north africa and in the spanish peninsula were held in bondage in italy spain portugal and france christian prisoners suffered the same fate in the lands of islam christians and moslems alike believed it just to hold heathens in servitude and both found victims among the negroes of africa the moslems got there first for several centuries before the opening of the european trade moslem merchants dragged dark captives across the hot sahara sands then in the fifteenth century portugal diverted this trade to the atlantic the prime mover in this development was a devout covetous prince named henry the navigator excited by stories of the great wealth of africa and asia he ordered his ships to explore the coast of africa there on a fateful day in henrys men came upon the first large group of africans they tiptoed through the high grass and crept to the edge of the village and then said a contemporary they looked towards the settlement and saw that the moors with their women and children were already coming as quickly as they could out of their dwellings because they had caught sight of their enemies but they shouting out st james st george portugal attacked them killing and taking all they could and at last the chronicler continued our lord god who giveth a reward for every good deed willed that for the toil they had undergone in his service they should that day obtain victory over their enemies as well as a guerdon and a payment for all their labour and expense for they took captive of those moors what with men women and children besides those that perished and were killed the pious portuguese captured seventy more africans including a girl they found sleeping in a deserted village and sailed home the captives were promptly baptized and enslaved within ten years portugal was importing one thousand africans a year a century later negroes outnumbered whites in some sections of portugal there was a big demand for negro domestics stevedores and agricultural laborers especially in the southern section by the middle of the sixteenth century says mary wilhelmina williams the inhabitants of the algarve were largely ethiopians and even as far north as lisbon blacks outnumbered whites there was no marked color line and the blood of the two races mingled freely resulting eventually in negroid physical characteristics in the portuguese nation christopher columbus and sugar made the slave trade a big business descendants of the first negro slavesblack christians born in spain and portugalwere among the first settlers of the new world negro explorers servants and slaves accompanied french spanish and portuguese explorers in their expeditions in north and south america they were with pizarro in peru cortes in mexico and menendez in florida thirty negroes were with balboa when he discovered the pacific ocean some authorities believe a negro made the first trip they say pedro alonso nino who piloted one of columbus ships was a negro among the outstanding negro explorers in the new world was estevanico who opened up new mexico and arizona for the spaniards other negroes w e b dubois says accompanied desoto and one of them stayed among the indians in alabama and became the first settler from the old world spaniards who took the lead in the exploration attempted at first to enslave indians but they died out so fast that bishop bartolome las casas a famous missionary recommended in the importation of africans las casas lived to regret this recommendation the development of largescale sugar planting gave the slave trade a cruel twist in a few years droves of negroes were crossing the atlantic each year and the soil of africa america and europe was drenched with their blood strange says eric williams that an article like sugar so sweet and necessary to human existence should have occasioned such crimes and bloodshed an estimated million of these negroes found their way to the land that became the united states of america but the first black immigrants antony isabella and the jamestown groups were not slaves this is a fact of capital importance in the history of the american negro they came these first black men the same way that many perhaps most of the first white men cameunder duress and pressure they found a system indentured servitude which enabled poor white men to come to america and sell their services for a stipulated number of years to planters under this system thousands of whitespaupers neerdowells religious dissenters waifs prisoners and prostitutes were shipped to the colonies and sold to the highest bidder some were sold as the first negroes were sold by the captains of ships some were kidnapped on the streets of london and bristol as the first negroes were kidnapped in the jungles of africa in virginia then as in other colonies the first negro settlers fell into a wellestablished socioeconomic groove which carried with it no implications of racial inferiority that came later but in the interim a period of forty years or more the first negroes accumulated land voted testified in court and mingled with whites on a basis of equality they owned other negro servants and at least one negro imported and paid for a white servant whom he held in servitude negro and white servants kenneth stampp says seemed to be remarkably unconcerned about their visible differences they toiled together in the fields fraternized during leisure hours and in and out of wedlock collaborated in siring a numerous progeny the racial situation at this juncture was fluid it contained the seeds of several alternatives indentured servitude could have continued for negro and white servants or both groups could have been reduced to slavery other possibilities were indian slavery and a free labor system for negroes and whites indians and immigrants socioeconomic forces selected negro slavery out of these alternatives in the west indies sugar was decisive in america tobacco and cotton were the villains a worldwide demand for these products and the rise of plantationsized units to meet this demand focused attention on the labor force how could men be forced to work the rulers of the early american colonies were not overly scrupulous about the color or national origin of their work force indian slavery was tried and abandoned many masters attempted to enslave white men and white women when these attempts failed the spotlight fell on the negro he was tried and he was found not wanting why were negroes more acceptable than poor whites and poor indians white men for one thing were under the protection of strong governments they could appeal to a monarch white men moreover were white they could escape and blend into the crowd indians too could escape they knew the country and their brothers were only a hill or a forest away another element in the failure of indian slavery was the fact that indians tended to sicken and die negroes did not have these disadvantages they were strong one negro the spanish said was worth four indians they were inexpensive the same money that would buy an irish or english indentured servant for ten years would buy an african for life they were visible they could run but they could not blend into the crowd above all they were unprotected and the supply unlike the supply of irishmen and englishmen seemed to be inexhaustible the rulers of early america fell to thinking why not virginia and maryland led the way in the s laws made negroes servants for life intermarriage was forbidden children born of negro women were ruled bond or free according to the status of the mother at first religion was the rationalization negroes were good material for slavery because they were not christians between and the basis shifted to race virginia said it first in her law of the conferring of baptisme doth not alter the condition of the person as to his bondage or freedom after that it was easy a series of laws stripped the negro slave of all rights of personality and made color a badge of servitude the negro population which had grown slowly during the twilight interim of freedom lunged forward by the number had increased to when the declaration of independence was signed there were by the twenty negroes who landed at jamestown in had become where did these people come from how did they come why did they come most of the negro slaves came from an area bordering a mile stretch on the west coast of africa they came chained two by two left leg to right leg from a thousand villages and towns they came from many racial stocks and many tribes from the spirited hausas the gentle mandingos the creative yorubas from the ibos efiks and krus from the proud fantins the warlike ashantis the shrewd dahomeans the binis and sengalese some slaves were captured in native wars and sold to slattees black slave merchants who sold them to europeans some were kidnapped by europeans and africans some were sold into slavery for infractions of native laws driven by slattees some captives made forced marches of miles to the coast where they were examined like cattle and packed into the holds of slave ships they came on these forced marches across rivers and over mountains barefooted and naked to their enemies with chains on their ankles burdens on their heads and fear in their hearts were theythese people who gave to the world the american negro were they the dregs of society no the strong came and the weak too priests princes warriors merchants and nobles came slave traders testified that it was not unusual for an african to sell an african today and to be captured and sold himself tomorrow the story is told of a slave merchant who sold a parcel of slaves and unwisely accepted a social drink to seal the transaction one drink led to anotherand to america the slave merchant woke up the next morning with a hangover and a brand on his chest he was in the hold of a slave ship with his victims and over him stood the captain laughing to beat the band this story underlines a rather obvious fact africans as well as europeans were involved in the slave trade there has been a systematic attempt however to overemphasize the degree of african involvement the picture of a whole continent of africans kidnapping and selling each other for rum guns and gewgaws is wide of the mark it is true that some africans corrupted by europes insatiable desire for human flesh sold their countrymen but many africans like king almammy and captain tomba loathed the whole business and forbade their subjects to take part in it european nations fought each other for the privilege of managing the trade portugal who ran the first leg was ousted by holland who in turn surrendered supremacy on the african coast to france and england portugal one trader said served for setting dogs to spring the game once the game was sprung all europe rushed to the playing field spain barred from africa by a papal bull which gave her most of the new world made her money by giving other powers a contract to supply her colonies with slaves this contract the infamous asiento was the national status symbol of that day it symbolized commercial and political supremacy in the eighteenth century when england held the asiento the slave trade was the basis of european commerce the cause of most of her wars and the prize politicians competed for an intricate set of trading arrangements existed on the guinea coast the west coast of africa for processing africans bought and stolen europeansfrench swedish danish portuguese dutch english and prussian tradersdotted the coast with a series of forts and factories each fort and factory had a dungeon or negroe house where slaves were confined until shipment into these factories europeans poured a steady stream of goods colorful cloth trinkets rum and other strong water blankets old sheetswhich were converted into human beings europeans operating as representatives of powerful companies or as private traders bartered these goods for men and women a woman might change hands for a gallon of brandy and six beads a man might bring eight guns a wicker bottle two cases of whiskey and twentyeight old sheets slaves were purchased from brokers at the forts and factories or in open markets john barbot a famous trader has described an open market on the slave coast as the slaves come down to fida from the inland country they are put into a booth or prison built for that purpose near the beach all of them together and when the europeans are to receive them they are brought out into a large plain where the surgeons examine every part of every one of them to the smallest member men and women being all stark naked such as are allowed good and sound are set on one side and the others by themselves which slaves so rejected are there called mackrons being above thirtyfive years of age or defective in their limbs eyes or teeth or grown grey or that have the venereal disease or any other imperfection these being so set aside each of the others which have passed as good is marked on the breast with a redhot iron imprinting the mark of the french english or dutch companies in this particular care is taken that the women as tenderest be not burnt too hard the newlypurchased slaves properly branded and chained were rowed out to the slave ships for the dreaded middle passage across the atlantic they were packed like books on shelves into holds which in some instances were no higher than eighteen inches they had not so much room one captain said as a man in his coffin either in length or breadth it was impossible for them to turn or shift with any degree of ease here for the six to ten weeks of the voyage the slaves lived like animals under the best of conditions the trip was intolerable when epidemics of dysentery or small pox swept the ships the trip was beyond endurance on many of these ships a contemporary said the sense of misery and suffocation was so terrible in the tweendeckswhere the height sometimes was only eighteen inches so that the unfortunate slaves could not turn round were wedged immovably in fact and chained to the deck by the neck and legsthat the slaves not infrequently would go mad before dying or suffocating in their frenzy some killed others in the hope of procuring more room to breathe men strangled those next to them and women drove nails into each others brains it was not unusual john newton said to find a dead and living man chained together so many dead people were thrown overboard on slavers that it was said that sharks would pick up a ship off the coast of africa and follow it to america all negroes did not come this way there was a trickle of free immigrants from the west indies and some black men and women got on boats in africa and paid their way to america in for example the governor of georgia issued a certificate to fenda lawrence a free black woman and heretofore a considerable trader in the river gambia n on the coast of africa who hath voluntarily come to be and remain for some time in this province the certificate gave miss lawrence permission to pass and repass unmolested within the said province on her lawful and necessary occasions fenda lawrence of course was an exception most negroes came in chains followed by wise and greedy sharks the survivors of this gruelling ordeal were sold either on the ships or in slave markets in american ports in new england where there was a large retail demand slaves were sold in taverns stores and warehouses some were shown as the ads put it in the merchants homes some slave merchants sold negroes and whites liquor clothing and other goods one merchant for example advertised several irish maid servants timemost of them for five years oneirish man servant one who is a goodbarber and wiggmakeralso four or five likely negro boys the price of men like the price of butter fluctuated george washington for example bought a man slave for in but when he went to the market ten years later he had to pay slaves were sold for small down payments and on reasonable terms an advertisement of noted that the buyer shall have or months credit there was also a mailorder business one new englander noted in his diary that i wrote mr salmon of barbadoes to send me a negro the human factories in africa struggled to keep up with the demand in the eighteenth century between and negro slaves crossed the atlantic each year the greatest number by far went to the west indies and brazil at least two million were shipped to the west indies joao pandia calogeras the brazilian historian said at least eighteen million were shipped to brazil arthur ramos another brazilian thinks this figure is too high five million he says is a more accurate estimate large blocks of slaves were dropped off in spanish colonies in the caribbean and in central and south america as early as there were twenty thousand negroes in mexico some slaves were imported before slavery was abolished in mexico in the first quarter of the nineteenth century hundreds of thousands of slaves were scattered over the areas of presentday panama colombia ecuador chile peru and venezuela in venezuela had some negroes in a total population of in there were negroes in cuba and only whites in the same year there were negroes in brazils population of more than of the brazilian negroes incidentally were free widespread amalgamation and unreliable census data make it difficult to assess the impact of these millions of south american life but in some south american countries people with negro blood still comprise a considerable proportion of the population what gilberto freyre the brazilian sociologist and philosopher said of brazil is true for a great part of the new world every brazilian even if he is light skinned and has fair hair bears in his soul the shadow or the mark of the native or the negro of the negro particularly on the seaboard from maragnan to rio grande in the south and in the state of mines the influence of the african is direct or vague and remote in our way of expressing tenderness in our excessive mimicry in our catholicism which is a delight of the senses in our way of walking and talking in the songs which cradled our childhood in short in all the sincere expressions of our life the negro influence is patent for the human chattel involved the slave trade was a stupendous roulette wheel the boats fanned out from africa and scattered human freight over the western hemisphere around and around the wheel went stopping here and there sealing wherever it stopped the fate of mothers and fathers and their children to the nth generation it made a great deal of difference to the slaves where the dice of fate fellwhether they landed for example in a country where the word was the spanish yo or the french je or the english i slavery to be sure was a form of hell wherever it existed but there were gradations of hell dantesque circles as it were within circles by all accounts the britishprotestant colonies were the deepest pit the roman catholic colonies especially the portuguese and spanish colonies were by comparison relatively mild the french and spanish could be cruel and often were but they did not seem to be driven by the same demons that pursued the puritans they did not for example interfere as much in the personal lives of the slaves in the roman catholic countries african religious practices and other elements of african culture were not as vigorously opposed as they were in the protestant colonies the protestant colonies with an instinct for the jugular vein rode herd on tomtoms and joyful noises unto the lord the difference this made in social cohesion is roughly the difference between the successful haitian revolution and the abortive nat turner insurrection the final meeting of the haitian revolution was held at a vodun ceremony and the signal went out by tomtoms another difference minor perhaps but important to the people involved was the texture of the different societies the catholic countries were gay and colorful the protestant colonies by comparison were a dull shade of grey more important was the relative absence of color prejudice in spanish america and portuguese brazil this fact gave a certain tone to social intercourse and the life of a slave in these colonies was less hopeless and unhappy than the life of a slave in say south carolina in brazil there was a state officer a protector of slaves who looked after the welfare of the disadvantaged manumission was easier in brazil and spanish america and a manumitted slave inherited the rights and privileges of citizens there were several ways in which a slave could win freedom if he could earn his purchase price he could walk up to his master and hand him the moneyand the master had to accept it he could earn money on sundays and religious holidays another means of salvation was childbearing if slave parents had ten children in hispanic america the whole family went free the difference between hispanic america and protestant america reduces itself as so many racial problems do to the problem of sex for reasons that are not entirely explicable the spanish and portuguese were willing to marry negroes in america white men drew the line at marriage that is in america in the french english spanish dutch and danish colonies the slaves were given a new conception of themselvesaccording to the different lights of their captors this process whether it took place in liberal brazil or harsh south carolina was a painful mindreversing operation in which two or three out of every ten died in one form or another every slave from africa went through a breakingin period during this period which varied from one to three years the slave was taught pidgin english or french or spanish he got a new name and began to look at himself and others in a different manner yahweh took the place of olorum legba became st peter the mass or hymnal replaced voodo the strain was too much for tens of thousands some died from old and new diseases some refused to give up shango and wasted away others ran away and died of exposure still others committed suicidedrowning was popular in liberal brazil charles s johnson has given an excellent description of the breakingin process in south carolina in the early days of the plantation regime when a gang of fresh africans were purchased they were assigned in groups to certain reliable slaves who initiated them into the ways of the plantation these drivers as they were called had the right of issuing or withholding rations to the raw recruits and of inflicting minor punishments they taught the new slaves to speak the broken english which they knew and to do the plantation work which required little skill at the end of a year the master or overseer for the first time directed the work of the new negro who now had become tamed assigning him to a special task of plantation work along with the other seasoned hands who had long since learned to obey orders to arise when the conch blew at day clean to handle a hoe in listing and banking to stand still when a white man spoke the merchandising and marketing of men made millioinaires in england and america and many people shared in the profits on the eve of the american revolution says dr lorenzo j green it the slave trade formed the very basis of the economic life of new england about it revolved and on it depended most of her other industries the vast sugar molasses and rum trade shipbuilding the distilleries a great many of the fisheries the employment of artisans and seamen even agricultureall were dependent upon the slave traffic liverpool in england newport in rhode island nantes in france prospered as slave trading centers it was a common saying eric williams reports that several of the principal streets of liverpool had been marked out bv the chains and the walls of the houses cemented by the blood of the african slaves and one street was nicknamed negro row the red brick customs house was blazoned with negro heads the story is told of an actor in the town who hissed by the audience for appearing before them not for the first time in a drunken condition steadied himself and declared with offended majesty i have not come here to be insulted by a set of wretches every brick in whose infernal town is cemented with an africans blood the western world williams contends is in danger of forgetting today what the negro has contributed to western civilization london and bristol bordeaux and marseilles cadiz and seville lisbon and new england all waxed fat on the profits on the trade in the tropical produce raised by the negro slave capitalism in england france holland and colonial america received a double stimulation from the manufacture of goods needed to exchange for slaves woolen and cotton goods copper and brass vessels and the firearms handcuffs chains and torture instruments indispensable on the slave ships and on the slave plantation this contribution of the negro has failed to receive adequate recognition it is more than ever necessary to remember it today england and france holland spain and denmark not to mention the united states brazil and other parts of south america are all indebted to negro labor africans helped build liverpool nantes and newport they helped finance the industrial revolution in england they helped clear the forest in america they did these things but they protested every step of the way protests began in africa where mutinies on ships were common and continued in america where revolts were common the negroes captain thomas phillips said are so willful and loth to leave their own country that they have often leapd out of the canoes boat and ship into the sea and kept under water till they were drowned to avoid being taken up and saved by our boats which pursued them they having a more dreadful apprehension of barbadoes than we can have of hell tho in reality they live much better there than in their own country but home is home etc home being home etc many slaves revolted brained the captain and crew and escaped to the shore rebellions on ships were so common that a new form of insurance was introducedinsurrection insurance many slaves refused to eat when well and refused to take medicine when ill one man for instance attempted to cut his throat after the wound was sewed up he ripped out the sutures with his fingernails he was patched up again but refused to eat and died ten days later of starvation in the west indies and on the mainland there were many revolts a long series of conspiracies and revolts culminated in the great haitian revolution which played an important part in the abolition of the trade pushed by fear of the unmanageable slaves and pulled by humanitarian motives stemming from the american and french revolutions politicians abolished the trade in the nineteenth century it continued surreptitiously however until the final abolition of slavery in the united states the slave trade left a bloodstained legacy during the four centuries the trade was pursued it wrecked the social and economic life of africa set tribe against tribe and village against village the trade was no less disastrous in europe and america where it left a legacy of ill will and guilt and a potentially explosive racial problem raphael painted w e b du bois has said luther preached corneille wrote and milton sang and through it all for four hundred years the dark captives wound to the sea amid the bleaching bones of the dead for four hundred years the sharks followed the scurrying ships for four hundred years america was strewn with the living and dying millions of a transplanted race for four hundred years ethiopia stretched forth her hands unto god
judge thurgood marshall by ernest e goodman he post of federal judge might prove unexciting to a lawyer who spent more than onehalf of his years before the bar of justice often pleading seemingly hopeless causes sometimes under extreme duress and even the threat of bodily harm but not for thurgood marshall who as judge of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit has found each day of his months on the bench as challenging as his years before it a graduate of the howard university school of law judge marshall was appointed to his present position by president kennedy in october and confirmed by the us senate months and many hearings later the cases which come before judge marshall today at the us courthouse overlooking new york citys foley square run the gamut admiralty criminal tax civil all types this court is the largest of its kind in the nation with the greatest variety of cases last year judge marshall participated in the hearing and decision of more than cases on appeal from us district courts this year the docket is even heavier but heavy schedules are not new to the foot pound jurist whose years as special counsel for the national association for the advancement of colored people were filled with workdays of hours or more then again he no longer is required to travel the miles a year that were necessary in his effort to obtain equal protection under the law for americas million negroes and although his present workload is somewhat lighter the length of his workday has shown no appreciable decrease his many other talents notwithstanding he never quite learned to relax today his evenings usually are spent poring over law books and examining case after case always with one thought in mind that of providing the same protection under the law for the parties involved in the cases before him that he sought for his clients during his naacp days to understand thurgood marshall one must go back to his boyhood days in baltimore racial discrimination and segregation were the way of life in baltimore in those days and young thurgood saw and felt these evils at every turn his father a railroad dining car worker and later steward at a country club and his mother a teacher in the public schools provided a comfortable home for him and his brother but outside the home were the everpresent humiliations of secondclass citizenship however his father was a man of principle as judge marshall puts it who told his sons that they not only had his permission but his orders to fight anyone who humiliated them because of their race about his father marshall says will marshall would sleep in the streets rather than betray his principles the same is said about judge marshall by those who know him it was while attending baltimores douglass high school that thurgood marshall developed an interest in the us constitution the document of which his knowledge years later was to earn for him the name of mr civil_rights judge marshall laughs today when he reflects on his introduction to the constitution it seems that in those days a form of discipline at douglass high consisted of sending the offender into the basement with instructions to read and memorize sections of the constitution i went to the basement so often judge marshall recalls that i knew the whole thing by heart before i reached my senior year after high school marshall enrolled at lincoln university in pennsylvania where he began a curriculum which would prepare him for dental school his plans for a career in dentistry were forsaken after he tried out for and won a position on the schools debating team this was the young students first experience at formal debating although argumentation had been one of his fortes since childhood one of the favorite pastimes at the marshall home had been the regular pro and con arguments between thurgood and his father on the issues of the day there were never any pros and cons on segregation however judge marshall says our only arguments on this subject were over the best methods of doing away with it marshalls success as a debater and the encouragement offered by his teammates combined to change his plans from dentistry to law marshall was graduated with honors from lincoln in june and enrolled in the howard law school three months later as an institution howard held no particular attraction for marshall at that time but the nations worst economic plight was setting in the university of marylands law school at baltimore barred negroes and howard had the most accessible and least expensive law school available to him then too during his travels as a debater he had met and come to admire charles h houston vice dean of the howard law school who was then pioneering in the field of civil_rights law throughout his three years at howard marshall commuted daily to and from baltimore a trip of some miles as a freshman he had to be up at am in order to make an eight oclock class then return to baltimore by midafternoon to one of the halfdozen or so parttime jobs which helped pay his tuition and transportation costs at the end of his freshman year marshall was the ranking student in his class thus qualifying for a job as student assistant in the law library the job paid the cost of his tuition but it also lengthened his day in washington during his second and third years of law school marshall rarely returned to baltimore before pm and the occasions were even fewer when he crawled into bed prior to midnight but the job of student assistant had its advantages too for one thing it gave marshall greater access to and knowledge of the books which were to become his bibles in later years then it put him in closer contact with houston who soon was to become his idol the howard law school had no formal course in civil_rights law in those days in fact it was not until when a young law professor from houston texas arrived on campus and introduced such a course that any american law school taught civil_rights as a part of its curriculum that young professor by the way is today the president of howard university dr james m nabrit jr in the early s those law students who showed real promise were selected by houston to participate in his informal civil_rights seminar which met two or three times a week in the law library not only was marshall an avid member of this group but midway his second year he was assisting in the preparation of briefs for actual civil_rights cases by the end of the year he was accompanying houston into many of the nations courtrooms it might come as a surprise even to those who knew the houstonmarshall team that the young law students first participation on a civil_rights brief was not for a houston case but for that of one of his colleagues professor william hastie who later was to become dean of the law school the case involved the right of a negro to enter the university of north carolina law school and the decision went against the plaintiff not too many years were to pass however before marshall would have a hand in changing such decisions no one seems to have greater admiration for marshall than hastie who today is himself a federal judge serving on the bench of the us court of appeals for the third circuit at philadelphia among judge hasties prize possessions is a contracts brief which marshall prepared as a student now and then i take it out and look at it again and still admire it hastie says marshall could talk for hours about the late charlie houston not only about his role as an outstanding lawyer but also his role as a scholar at whose feet a student was privileged to sit houston had three goals during his tenure at howard according to judge marshall he wanted first to raise the academic level of the law school secondly he wanted the negro lawyer to attain a position of respect and esteem and thirdly he wanted his students to become not just lawyers but social engineers before resigning his law school post in to accept the position of legal counsel for the naacp houston had accomplished all three objectives marshall was graduated at the top of his class in february and established his law practice in baltimore seven months later but the nation was still in the throes of a depression and marshalls practice reflected it judge marshall estimates that he lost during his first year as a lawyer things took a turn for the better during the second year and the young lawyer began to gain in reputation as well as financial solvency the latter gain proved to be shortlived though for the civil_rights bug again had bitten him increasingly he began to find himself handling such noteworthy but low paying legal actions the first major civil_rights case which marshall was to argue was murray v pearson in it involved the right of donald murray negro to enroll at the university of maryland law school in baltimore the school which marshall himself might have entered five years earlier had he been permitted marshall remembered this then too he remembered that he had helped prepare the brief on the similar university of north carolina case which had been lost for the murray case marshall was teamed with houston his friend and teacher so effective were the arguments of the team that the lower court ordered murrays admission to the school an unprecedented action in those days the state of maryland appealed but the decision was upheld at the appellate level houston was granted a sixmonth leave from his naacp post in and marshall was called to new york to replace him for the next two years his practice was divided between new york and baltimore with less and less time being spent in the latter city when houston resigned in to return to private practice marshall was named to succeed him as special counsel for the naacp well does judge marshall remember those early days in new york a salary and the walkup flat in harlem but the lack of luxury failed to bother him once you get into this business of civil_rights he said you dont think of money and get into it he did trade union discrimination restrictive covenants segregation in interstate travel racial exclusion from state universities unequal pay for negro teachers the white primary exclusion of negroes from jury duty and discrimination in the armed forces all were to fall before marshall and the battery of naacp lawyers during his first years on the job and although he trod dangerous grounds and had his life threatened on more than one occasion on his treks into the south even there he was winning the respect of many of his adversaries during his first year on the job marshall had an occasion to go to dallas texas to protest the exclusion of negroes from jury duty the young lawyer went directly to the governor james allred who was so impressed with his presentation that he not only ordered out texas rangers to protect the right of negroes to serve on juries but also volunteered to ask the fbi to study the situation then there was the time in when marshall was interrupted in the middle of the night by a telephone call from a southern city the caller informed him that a lynching party was gathering at the local jail and asked his help in averting a tragedy as was his custom marshall took the most direct avenue available to him he put through a call to a prominent attorney in the state saying look just two sets of people cant afford a lynching at this timeus negroes and you people youre right in the midst of a dixiecrat political campaign and a lynchings going to make you people look awful bad twenty minutes later the attorney called back the state troopers made it in time he said call this number in a few minutes your man will be there unharmed these instances were by no means typical of marshalls experiences with southern officials however many was the time when he had to enter and leave a town under cover of night although the reverse of this occurred one year in a small mississippi town there he was warned by the sheriff to leave before nightfall because of the towns reputation of not letting the sun set on a negros head then there was columbia tenn in marshall had been called to the town to defend several negroes accused of murder during a race riot because of the hostile atmosphere in columbia marshall and his legal colleagues took up residence in nashville and commuted miles each day it was on leaving columbia one day that marshalls car was forced off the road by several police cars out jumped eight to ten policemen their pistols brandished demanding to see marshalls driving permit the attorney produced his license and after a while the officers left but moments later the same police crew curbed marshalls car again this time charging him with being drunk and transporting liquor in his car they searched the car but found nothing so they left again hardly five minutes had passed before the same crew was back this time the charge was drunken driving and marshall was ordered to get out of the car and walk across the road to the magistrates office thurgood knew that terrible things had happened to negroes for resisting arrest in such cases so he refused to walk across the road unless escorted by the police after some debate the officers escorted him across the road to the magistrate where he stood breathing as hard as i could into his face judge marshall said he nearly used up all his breath in convincing the magistrate that he had not been drinking and was allowed to leave after that i really needed a drink marshall declared by word and deed the naacps preference in racial matters has been for persuasion rather than legal action but the hard core of resistance which the organization has met has left it with no alternative but the courts and it was in the courts that marshall was to earn his reputation as one of the greatest constitutional lawyers of all times marshalls talents were widely known in the legal profession and in the negro community well before but it was not until that year may to be exact that his name became a household word throughout america in the civil_rights cases of the s marshalls method had been to attack the inequalities of separate but equal facilities for the school cases he and his colleagues decided to go all out in an attack on segregation itself with the weight of precedent against them the naacp lawyers decided to use a new tack marshalling a group of some outstanding educators historians economists sociologists anthropologists psychologists and psychiatrists marshall co built their case on the premise that segregated education could not be equal an indication of the respect that marshalls opponents had for him is seen in the case of the state of south carolina rather than send its attorney general up against marshall south carolina called in john w davis dean of us constitutional lawyers to defend its separate but equal position when the supreme court handed down its unanimous decision in favor of the plaintiffs i was so happy i was numb marshall said the school desegregation decision was considered by many including judge marshall as the wedge to open the door to full citizenship for negroes but the best estimates at that time were that yet another generation of litigation would be needed before the goal could be fully realized marshall was opening the door wider and wider when tapped for the federal bench in there were misgivings in some quarters when marshall accepted the judgeship nabrit had assumed the presidency and spottswood robinson of richmond va the law deanship at howard robinsons partner oliver hill had accepted a government post and now marshall was leaving the field there was even some talk of a plot to rid the negro of his best civil_rights lawyers but marshall and his colleagues had no such misgivings we had built up a core of able young lawyers all over the country who could pick up the ball and run with it judge marshall said at naacp legal defense fund headquarters in new york there was to be a staff headed by jack greenberg and constance motley and including derrick bell michael meltsner rufus smith and james m nabrit iii the latter being the younger half of what marshall calls the finest fatherson team ive ever met today judge marshall can look back on a record before the supreme court that with the possible exception of john davis can be matched by no man cases wins and losses but marshall is not a man to look back besides his preoccupation with present duties has left him little time for reflection or anything else the honors and awards which have come judge marshalls way during his career number more than among these are the two highest given by howard universitythe alumni achievement award and the honorary degree of doctor of laws the latter being one of such degrees which have been conferred upon him and although marshall refuses to give priority to any one of his awards one cannot help but think that his greatest moment came when the naacp conferred the spingarn medal upon him in judge marshall does very little traveling now partly out of the desire to be at home with his family and partly because of his conception of what a judges role should be his speaking engagements by and large are limited to law groups and even his social contacts are restricted particularly where trial lawyers are involved at home there is little rest for the weary jurist his two young sons see to that thurgood jr age and fouryear old john william take over from the time he arrives for dinner until they are forced into their beds at pm only then can marshall relax briefly usually in front of the television set before dragging out another law book his wife the former cecilia suyat who once worked as a secretary at naacp headquarters tries to get him out to a play or movie at least once a week but even she meets with only moderate success cissy as judge marshall calls her is his second wife his first marriage to the former vivien burey of philadelphia ended after years with her death in judge marshalls prime concern at this time seems to be his sons and their development he says that they will get the best education money can buy will they be lawyers this will be left to them marshall admits however that he will not be at all unhappy if they select legal careers thurgood jrs sights already have been set chief judge j edward lumbard of his fathers court was visiting the marshall home one night recently when he encountered young thurgoods usual who are you where do you work what do you do interrogation after judge lumbard supplied the answers thurgood jr turned to his father and in a loud and stern voice announced i dont want to be just a judge i want to be chief judge rhodes scholar family by hans knight he street is called marchand street and i the section on which number the rented sixroom house of edgar wideman stands is not the newest in pittsburgh nor is it the oldest the sections name is east liberty the house is an unremarkable twostory structure of wood with an attic and a small backyard and if it is gathering a measure of fame these days it is not because of edgar wideman or his wife bette or his three boys and one girl who live in it the fame stems from the fact that this is the home of john wideman whose middle initial is e for edgar who is a student at pennsylvania university captain of its basketball team sometime quartermiler on the varsity track team member of phi beta kappa and the second american negro to win a rhodes scholarship one of educations prime trophies this entitles him to study for two years at oxford england john wideman came to penn under a benjamin franklin academic scholarship and he earns some of his meals waiting on table in the athletic training house edgar wideman stands six feet one a bare inch shorter than his son when he crooks his arms his biceps strain against the rolledup sleeves of his flannel shirt the muscles of which at he is unobstrusively proud result from basketball scrimmages at the boys club down the lane and from lifting cans of trash on to a truck mr wideman is a parttime garbage collector for the city of pittsburgh the city pays dollars and cents a day for this work when trash is plentiful as after christmas or thanksgiving mr wideman works two sometimes even three days a week some weeks he doesnt work he sings tenor in the choir of the homewood ame zion church to which the family belongs and in his spare time he is a freelance waiter at catered affairs its very convenient he said i start my collection rounds all over the city at am and im usually home by pm that gives me plenty of time to be a waiter in case anybody wants one in fact he added ruefully ive got too much time on my hands at his age he said a man looks for security he has taken the civil service examination for water meter reader and has been told that he came out sixth highest among some three hundred applicants therefore he said he was hopeful of getting the job one of these days he regretted he said that he didnt finish college he quit dentistry school at pittsburgh university after two years when his money ran out he worked briefly in the government printing office in washington after his marriage in pittsburgh john was bom in columbus hospital in washington mrs wideman said it was june flag day no less the birth is registered in the capital but we consider john a pennsylvanian mrs wideman is a tall slender woman with serious eyes she has been working at the gift counter of a city department store for five years ever since the children were old enough to go to school she earns about a week she rides the street car to work after sending the children off and she comes home about the children pitch in with the housework my main job she said is keeping the family together theres little time that we can all be home so we try to make the most of it we havent been blessed with material goods but we have the family i think thats important her husband smiled broadly yes he said thats one thing you dont have to be rich to enjoy neither edgar nor bette wideman can explain their sons scholastic successes he doesnt have it from me she said certainly not from me he laughed its something god gave him perhaps she said john the elder wideman said seemed to have the gift from the start he never worked very hard at it he said id come home and see him playing with friends in the street and ask him if hed done his studies and hed say oh okay ill get to it and the as just came he played as much as any boy he didnt sit and cram for hours it was just there on his garbage rounds wideman said people whove seen his picture in the papers and on television look at me hard and say arent you related to that john wideman are you his brother maybe then i say im his father and peopleall kinds of people rich and poor all racestake an interest and want to know how he did it and what hes going to do and they congratulate me but what did i do john did it himself john had always been interested in writing mrs wideman said she rummaged among some papers and brought out a copy of sermons in poetry a booklet published by the american poetry society in every night before i go to sleep i think of the pleasure from life that reap i think of the blessings and good times enjoy that would be like a dream to some other boy think of my family secure in affection and health and grow tired as ponder our immeasurable wealth then when l hear my parents mounting the stairs i bow my head and say my prayers thats the first thing he ever had published though he didnt get paid for it mrs wideman said he writes better now but i dont think hes changed his philosophy much but john himself had changed his father laughed i can still see him as a little boy his grandfatherjohn was the apple of the old mans eyewould take him out sunday morning lift him on his shoulders and carry him down the street like he was the prince of wales john attended liberty elementary school a twostory brick building on shadyside avenue where the family lived before moving to marchand street last fall years back said horton moon edgar widemans brotherinlaw whod dropped in with his wife catherine millionaires lived in that neighborhood then they moved away now other people live there including us the street in which john wideman grew up is lined with shaggy trees shading houses with colonial style porches john his father said associated with a variety of friends some were nice kids some were hoodlums but both the nice kids and the hoodlums liked john he had the ability to get along with everybody and i dont mean that hed give in to them i think it was something inside of him some strength some honesty that made them like and respect him he never had an enemy when hes home his friends come and invite him whites negroes except said mrs wideman i dont know how they feed him hes the biggest eater you ever saw favorite foods id say his favorite food is plenty just that plenty and spiced he puts sauce over everything by the time john wideman entered peabody high school hed already made something of a name for himself in the neighborhood as a basketball and football player he quit football when they brought him home one day with his face kicked in he took as naturally to sports as he did to learning his father said in fact he learned much from athleticsthat you cant always win but you can always try and that you have to keep in shape if you expect the best of yourself that you have to have selfdiscipline as well as ability the phone rang at that point for the fourth time in twenty minutes and edgar wideman sighed and answered it oh tisha he called upstairs wouldnt it help if you answered the phone all the calls are for you anyway letitia at the only sister to four brothers obediently came skipping downstairs im going to have a fiveminute limit on her conversations any day now wideman muttered let her save up for an answering service but daddy letitia wailed they hung up who was it only a girl her father said grimly and letitia breathed a relieved oh you should see john and tisha fight mrs wideman said john is a great teaser and tisha teases him back and off they go his son wideman said may be a celebrity outside but he isnt one at home nor does he want to be to us hes spanky thats the nickname i gave him when he was a boy and hes stuck with it oh dont say that said his wife john will never forgive you yes he will smiled his father the living room is small and neat its blue walls peeling in spots are decorated by two pictures john painted at the picturesone of a waxenfaced man with dark glasses against a garish neon sign backdrop the other depicting impressionistic horsemen won him an award in an arts contest sponsored by a city store john his father said loves to paint he even painted his aunts bedroom pink during a recent visit he loves music too modern and classical in a way im glad he never took up an instrument who knows with his touch he might have been great at it and then where would he be you can only do so much in one life for a while he was very interested in psychiatry so he wondered whether he shouldnt be a psychiatrist but he decided it would take him too long to finish then he wanted to be a psychologist i do think hes settled in literature he wants to teach and write he wants to write a great novel or play but hes also realistic he knows he has to have a job a regular profession and he likes teaching very much so hell be a teacher of english in college mrs wideman showed part of a letter john had written at christmas it spoke of gratitude for having a place he could call home it spoke of his inability to repay his parents for what theyd given him he did it all himself his father said his mother nodded agreement he read much his father said he read the greek classics for pleasure not because he had to last year his father recalled john engaged in one of his few business deals he bought a car from somebody for hed always wanted a car of his own well he brought it home proud as can be hed signed the papers without benefit of lawyers of course when he tried it out the second time the hood fell off since by coincidence it happened to be inspection time the authorities ordered the car off the streetunconditionally and forever he wished edgar wideman said quietly he could give his son a car when he graduates in may maybe mrs wideman remarked dryly youd better buy him a boat since hes going to england maybe youre right at that her husband agreed amiably if the widemans are frankly proud of their oldest son theyre equally proud of their other children otis david robert and letitia they hope they will be able to go to college they dont think theyll be able to help them much financially any more than they could help john theyre all good in their own way mrs wideman said as for the children they have taken johns distinctions with aplomb that saturday night when john telephoned her the news mrs wideman yelled to letitia tisha spankys a rhodes scholar the girl merely shrugged but said her mother hes already got a phi beta kappa key so has president kennedy letitia said evenly and swept out of the room how to win the rat race problem with surriviving the threat of i nuclear annihilation freeway traffic and riots on the ole miss campus is that survival still leaves you alive in the rat race this is a condition preferable perhaps to death but just barely nevertheless if youre going to be stuck in the pressure cooker of modernday living the cliche if you cant beat em join em is just no longer good enough it is not sufficient to merely join the rat race you must become good at it in the interest of ascertaining what qualities or guide rules are necessary in gaining proficiency at ratracing we have interviewed scores of successful businessmen and found the formula to be simple nothing so mundane as hard work or so oldfashioned as marrying the boss daughter or even so naive as the golden rule but simple nonetheless it should be pointed out at this time that these rules apply primarily to the business world where ratracing has been developed to a high art the soundness for concentrating in this area is based on the fact that you will need money as long as you live and while it really cant buy happiness it does make a nice down payment thus with the thought of success in the world of money in mind we come to rule one be sincere sincerity is described in the dictionary as the quality of being without deceit pretense or hypocrisy the reason for being sincere is that to be insincere is to run the risk of being uncovered as a scoundrel and an opportunist nothing could be more damaging to your chances of success than to have your boss learn that all those times you asked him about his wife and kids all the concern you showed for his ulcer and all the admiration you have evidenced at his great wisdom and keen intellect was simply to put him on therefore the rule is be sincerewhether you mean it or not rule two never lie the problem with lying is that it sometimes requires betterthanaverage creative powers and frequently demands an excellent memory the average person has enough trouble trying to remember what has actually happened let alone something that didnt occur at all besides lying is as bad as insincerity and morally indefensible in the final analysis there is but one exception to this rule only one occasion when lying is permissible that is whenever it will make things easier for you rule three be decisive getting ahead in life invariably re quires learning to make decisions this is especially important in the business world in your struggle to achieve success however you should avoid making really important decisions for there is always the possibility that your decisive action may reveal you as having an inadequate grasp of the facts or inferior mental powers instead you might wait to get the boss opinion then quickly agree with him this is sure to mark you as a bright perceptive fellow turn your mind instead to deciding such matters as whether to find a good excuse to get out of the office for the afternoon or go goof off down at the water fountain incidentally the water fountain is your best bet often a piece of office gossip picked up there can if properly exploited be far more valuable in advancing your career than weeks of hard work which is not to be recommended anyway rule four accept responsibility the principle of accepting responsibility is one we learn at childhood and practice the rest of our lives while it is usually considered a burden there are certain subtle and ingenious ways in which this can actually become a magic carpet to success let us say for instance that your boss is highly enthusiastic about a report prepared by you and a coworker and happens to drop by your desk to tell you so at a time when your partner is out to lunch a seemingly casual but careful acceptance of responsibility at this point can be invaluable you might answer the boss compliments with something like oh that well as long as you like it sir it was worth my staying up all night to write the final draft or better still it was really pretty easy once i got anderson around to my way of thinking the fact that anderson wrote the entire report without your being able to understand what the hell any of it was about has nothing to do with it the responsibility is there for you accept it rule five make sacrifices this is one of the toughest things for young men on their way up to realize that they must be willing to make sacrifices the bookkeeper in one eastern firm understood this fact of life well however and when a shortage was discovered in his books one day he sacrificed his assistant his secretary and by the time he got through pointing his fingerhalf of the office force his willingness to make sacrifices of this sort eventually earned him a vice presidency rule six invite criticism if you are going to truly succeed you must learn to accept indeed even encourage critical analysis of workaday actions you must realize that there is absolutely nothing wrong with healthy constructive criticismespecially if it is not directed at you you may learn to adopt the proper attitude toward this important business tool by using it on your fellow workers whenever the opportunityin the form of the bosspresents itself so there you have them a halfdozen rules guaranteed to get you well ahead in the rat race a position you can easily maintain by keeping a wary eye out for anybody sneaky enough to use your system the time is now by dr broadus n butler we are deeply impressed by two facts about the present employment and career horizon for xt a young negro men and women one of them is bold and encouraging the other should be a matter of grave concern to us all the bold fact is that the dedicated labors of the many organizations and people who have striven for equal employment opportunity have begun to come to harvest and opportunity is real now the fact about which there should be grave concern is that neither the young people nor their parents nor their counselors with few exceptions have achieved a full appreciation and realization of what this means it can be said with complete justification and validity that until the past year equal opportunity or even opportunity itself in any genuine sense was a kind of nebulous thing that made good platitudes but did not really exist for young negro men and women in the important sectors of our national and economic life it is no wonder that they could not be easily motivated to engage the strenuous effort of high preparation for careers which they were at the same time being impressed that they would be denied however it can now be said with equal validity that so radical a change has taken place over the past year that the mantle is upon our shoulders now to produce young men and women to assume the responsible roles that now cry for them and now find them neither sufficiently motivated nor yet fully prepared in the sense of discipline not in the sense of capacity to gird themselves to assume we are so rapidly approaching the dream and the hope expressed by langston hughes when he said o let my land be a land where liberty is crowned with no patriotic wreath but opportunity is real and life is free equality is in the air we breathe the most degrading and depressing consequences of employment discrimination have been that it has made the potential man look down and has sunk that potential mans aspirations and achievements so far below the level of his inherent capacities that it not only demeaned and degraded the man but it deprived society of the full measure of what would have been that fully developed man any person tends to see things at his own eye level so if our youth do not raise their sights or have their sights elevated they will not even now see the real opportunities and concomitant responsibilities there are for competent confident responsible and adequate young men and women in this day industry is calling for young executives where are they skilled trades are calling for young negro men to return to them where are they technology is calling for men of science and research where are they government is calling for civil service executives for classifications g and above where are they cities states and the nation are looking for capable and responsible office holders where are they agencies of stock exchanges and banking and finance are looking for brokers and analysts where are they educational institutions and boards of education need able and visionary policy makers who will avoid the inadequacies of the past and have the courage to build an educational foundation adequate to the needs of the future where are they houses and communities which are not yet homes and neighborhoods are calling for young men and young women who can make houses homes in the real sense of family life and make communities neighborhoods in the positive reciprocity of neighborliness where are they they are in our schools and collegessome of them they have dropped out of school and are not working at allsome of them a relatively recent report showed that almost half of the best students in high school still do not enter college they are working odd parttime jobssome of them they are working jobs out of proper classificationsome of them they have resigned themselves to jobs that are well below their performance capacitiessome of them they are confused and discouragedsome of them wherever they are they must be found and counseled and encouraged they must have the confidence in themselves to explore and to keep exploring above all they must quickly acquire that added measure of competence qualification and confidence which transforms a youth into a man to this end we need more or ganized efforts to bring promising young people together under an entirely different definition of purpose frankly we have had the day of massive mobilization of resources for annual dances we need less social club emphasis and more preprofessional and prebusiness club emphasis we need fewer social fraternities and more career orientated fraternities and sororities among such clubs and fraternities we must get well beyond future teachers clubs to add future engineers clubs future architects clubs future diplomats clubs future executives clubs future politicians clubs future writers clubs future poets clubs future businessmen clubs and so on fathers mothers and counselors ours is now the responsibility to gain more knowledge of the realities of this new day and to guide and inspire our youth to a sense of the fullness of the opportunity that now prevails for them to explore and to realize the full range and extent of their capacities without regard to previous restrictions their sights and personal horizons need breadth their personal sense of confidence competence and adequacy needs depth their sense of projection purpose and potentialities needs length their aspiration levels need height their sense of their own dignity and value as persons needs unfolding their knowledge of the heretofore inaccessible tools and instrumentalities of knowledge and training for the full development of whatever capacities they possess needs fulfillment even in northern colleges and universities only onethird of negro students are men twothirds are women the majority of these men are looking to fields of teaching medicine and law the majority of the women have been conditioned to seek careers in teaching nursing and social work fields while the needs in these fields should not be overlooked we must set the sights of our young men and women far beyond these to the more diversified roles and responsibilities which our economy our society and our nation are already begging for them to assume today this is the new meaning of the discipline that is incumbent upon parents and counselors as well as youth in this day because more than anything else our young men need to regain the lost or suppressed meaning of what it is to be a male man with a male image of adequacy responsibility and selfrealization commensurate with the responsibility of a free man questing to develop and utilize his creatorendowed talents this is their task and ours instead of systematically suppressing and demeaning and disvaluing our youth and leading them through successive stages of submission and forced retreat into the bramble bushes and hazy thicket of feelings of inferiority and inadequacy so please wake up young men young women gird yourselves for the longer and more demanding preparation for an earlier assumption of more mature more real responsibilities than your fathers and mothers were privileged to do little more than dream of in their lifetimes dont stop dont dropout persevere it is only six years now between george shirley student at wayne state university virtually unknown beyond his family and his instructors to george shirley

negligible by dr f we could probe the innermost secrets of some weary negro sharecropper in the south or a persecuted black muslim in a northern city mosque we might find him ever so briefly enjoying the wish that russia and white america would blow each other up and leave negroes to live on in peace but the unfortunate and strangely neglected fact is that the negros probability of being decimated is much higher than that of whites although he would hold a number of useful advantages in a nuclear war why then has such an important subject been gagged in the barrage of research and verbiage on the negro and on the nuclear threat why would scholars who have studied and bisected the negro in all of his ramifications from the negro as seen by the mulatto and the negro as seen by himself to the ecological distribution of negroes and georgia pines pass up the glaring question of the negros relative exposure and immunity to nuclear annihilation much of the neglect may be a product of the fallacy that since wars are waged between territorial and political blocs called nations all persons therein confined are equally subject to a common enemys destruction on the contrary sociologists have found a consistent relationship for example between income level and the tendency to die in wartime the lower an individuals family income the greater his chance of dying in battle the reason is probably that the lower classes produce more combat soldiers while the higher classes serve rather frequently as officers and as strategists then there are the critical occupationsnot to mention political offices to be filledwhich keep more of the higher classes safe in civilian life however the question of our concern is not simply a matter of social class it exists as we shall see in the racial condition of the negro per se there is in the first place the ecological fact that the negro race is ghettoed in black belts now more properly called i thinkblack corsets near the centers or bullseyes of our big cities bullseyes and sitting ducks professor karl taeuber of the university of chicago and one of the foremost authorities on the concentration and location of the races in this country recently discovered that negroes are less dispersed residentially than even puerto ricans even though they puerto ricans havent been in the city as long and have an inferior economic status in a speech before the board of directors of the chicago urban league he reported a study financed by the ford foundation which found that five out of every six u s cities having more than white households in had indexes of residential segregation above complete segregation would show an index of and absolute nonsegregation an index of this is especially so in large cities chicagos segregation index for example rose during the past decade from to this means that negroes in our big cities now live in bullseyes enclosed by white satellite suburban rings the u s census for shows suburbs known to be devoid of a single negro inhabitant and likewise in washington d c the capital of the nation for example whites have dwindled to a numerical minority moreover the concentration of negroes in these black corsets is on the increase my computations from u s census data show negroes for the first time in more urban than whites per cent to and the change in the negros urban proportion during the decade was more than twice as large as that of whites in addition more than nine out of ten of all negroes living outside the south west north central north east sections more likely to attract enemy warheads and missiles live in cities indeed the central cities of the largest u s metropolitan areas new york los angeles chicago philadelphia detroit san franciscooakland boston pittsburgh st louis washington cleveland baltimorenow hold three out of five of the negroes living outside the south and one out of every three in the entire country assuming that such large central cities as the foregoing would be priority targets let us calculate the relevance of the negros distribution to a nuclear attack as a preface to our treatment of the social psychology of the negros survivability say russia does drop a megaton bomb on washington d c or chicago for example up to five miles from ground zero the point of the explosion nine out of ten of all inhabitants would be killed instantly and the rest seriously injured or victimized by radiation all structures would be demolished from to miles out half of the inhabitants would be killed a third of them injured all others dazed shocked and sickened by radiation and all buildings damaged beyond repair in other words this would just about take care of the negro community on the other hand from to miles out only per cent of the individuals would be killed per cent injured seriously the others slightly or not at all while buiidings would require considerable repairs only two per cent of persons more than miles out largely white areas and beyond would be killed while four out of five would go mainly unhurt and damage to property would be minor although we have assumed that the attack would occur by night the picture would be much the same if the attack should come during the school hours of the day as children for examplethe future of a raceare sent to school in relation to their residence more than half of philadelphias elementary schools are either per cent white on the one hand or per cent negro on the other and per cent of chicagos negro pupils attend virtually allnegro schools persons at work during a daytime attack would offset the pattern considerably but studies show a tendency for people to try to live as near as possible all things considered to their place of work although this is less true of whites employed in the central district and at the higher income levels thus at any given moment during the hour cycle the majority of negroes are in or near the heart of the cities while the whites predominate in the outer rings of the metropolitan community this is especially so at night you cant hide here in spite of all of the foregoing if there are shelters in the black belt no one knows where they are says a chicago defender editorial october with an average income about smaller than the average white familys and with more mouths per family to care for the typical negro couldnt afford a shelter if he wanted to not that this makes that much difference slum dwellings and shelters near the center of the city would amount to incinerators anyway from the blast itself in part but also because the trash and debris of the fireprone buildings would be more subject to fire storms true a few negroes caught away from the center and shelterless may be admitted to one as a guest but most prospective shelterhosts would be white and the negro intruder probably would not be permitted even to place his feet on the welcome mat however with the chaos and the breakdown of social control the government itself plans to go underground it may be a bit too idealistic to expect individuals to obey current laws regarding property rights people might just fall into any fallout shelter in sight and it is not hard to imagine a negro maid or handyman suddenly taking authority and demanding space beside the white boss in his shelter but even on the shareyourshelter plan there would not be anywhere near enough whites themselves are said to have more swimming pools than they have shelters realizing this the government now is stressing community or mass shelters but there is no reason to expect that in these tombs of human moles the negro would receive any more of his share than he does in the serenity of the present day particularly in prejudiced localities there would be no time to stage a hidein or a shelterin no naacp to take it to the supreme court and no national guardsmen or u s marshals to call out even if the attorney general could be found thus the negro would find himself with no place to hide even in the matter of evacuation there probably would be no way out living in the central city fenced in by whites he would have a longer distance to go but a shorter time to travel five miles from a megaton explosion the heavier fallout would reach the ground in half an hour but twenty miles away there would be nearly an hour to get ready or evacuate also open country and highways would not be far away from the suburbs while all through the congested black corsets the narrow crisscross sometimes winding streets would be hopelessly jammed with wrecked autos and frantically honking cars containing by then negro wrecks even a warning signal would have done them little good survivability or postattack hustling some experts have raised the question wouldnt the survivors envy the dead anyway they refer to the enduring hazards of fallout and enemy attack on the one hand but particularly the emotional shock of emerging lost and separated from the persons and things once held important to face the turmoil and destruction of the postattack environment much of the problemthey feelwould revolve around the breakdown of law order and morality and the frustrations of extreme social and psychological insecurity thus notwithstanding the negros special exposure to the blast and his narrow chances of escaping or absorbing direct attack those remaining might prove better equipped to survive in some respects than whites especially in the psychological sense the negros superiority in psychological survivability is a product of the contrasting experiences and conditioning of the two races in this country for example even in the physical sense of enduring the intense heat likely to prevail in a fallout shelter many negroes possess cottonchopping cottonpicking backgrounds in the southern sun and long years of tending ovens and furnaces in white kitchens and factories which in this case would be to their advantage in the social or psychological sense negroes are far more conditioned to hard times and suffering they know what it is to have to hustle from check to check and in many cases from one meal to the next much of the shock that whites would experience in the postattack environment of deprivation and social inconsistence would seem commonplace to negroes for they have known a world of agony from the middle passage and plantation slavery down to the present regimes of the south and the southernyfied north in contrast to white persons they would not be so prone to suicide judging by past and present rates and their ability to stand up under stress and torture also may have been evident in the korean war in korean prisonerofwar camps it was recorded that negro pows were much less likely to defect to the side of the communistsquiet as it is kept on the other hand the negros condition would of course present a tremendous handicap to him many for one thing would find themselves unprepared to follow the fourth key to household safety issued by the office of civil defense it reads brusquely close all windows and doors and draw the blinds but many such fixtures in low income negro homes would be in need of repair with broken and jammed windows and blinds ready to come tumbling down if tugged too hastily also even negroes who have heard of geiger counters and such instruments for detecting radioactivity generally cannot afford them this may be one reason why so many have taken a returntosender attitude with regard to such pamphlets sent out by the office of civil defense but that is not the only reason a peaceable race in the peace race although negroes are wellnoted for their patience and piety and now boast of their facility in this regard as exhibited in the passive resistance campaign they have been conspicuously shy of peace movements as such while professing to be a peaceable race they have disdained the peace race for fear of seeming unamerican thus they have been lured by white superpatriots into the most unamerican tendency in the ideal sense historically speaking that this country has ever known in the fashion of the typical white citizen of our day the negro has become what c wright mills the late sociologist of columbia university called cheerful robots mills wrote this in his book the causes of world war iii which was an expansion of his sidney hillman lectures delivered at howard university in march of he noted that cheerful robots white and black sit back and accept with glee and indifference without question anything white leaders present to them as reality regarding international relations indeed some professors lecturing in negro college classrooms on war and related phenomena have had to pause midway and ask the students please to arouse some snoozing classmate even the grandiose negro leadership conference on africa recently held at impressive columbia university uniquely bringing together more than negro representatives of some different organizations had as its theme the integration of negroes into the existing scheme of things untouched while these leaders justly issued a plea for more negro diplomats and demanded that white policymakers let negroes know all about the full details of all us dealings with africa the only direct effort they made to improve or contribute to us foreign policy was to try to sic white america on south africa they wanted the us to cast the first stone and chastize white south africa for mistreating local africans in domestic relations thus in spite of all the picturetaking and speechmaking at the conference it was no refutation of the sad truth that there is a paucity of concern among those most in jeopardynegroes as we have seenin the event of a nuclear war while it is possible only to speculate on the relative survivability of whites and negroes in a nuclear war figures are convincing and it is hoped that neither will ever face the test however there is one thing apparent negroes had better go ahead and take over the battle for peace now bleakly muddled by the whites of the world before it is too late even to call on st peter for help who is to blame n the past this magav zine has been criti cized for not admonishing negro americans of their faults our editorials tend too frequently to concentrate on the failures of whites their lack of charity for the negro minority their neglect of the requirements of justice where we may have failed the july harpers magazine and its hardhitting editor john fischer have registered devastating blows in a severe editorial later reprinted in readers digest editor fischer lashes out at the negro and his failure to shoulder a bigger responsibility for the fix hes in there is no use denying his stern allegations they are undoubtedly true but as is so often the case their full import is a matter of perspective and of emphasis the faults of the negro are present for all to see the responsibility for these faults is not so easy to discern the correction of them we submit is not simply a matter of negro responsibility once more as so often in the past we return to an insistent reminder of ours the failure of the negro to take his place as a first class citizen does not rest on his shoulders alone and even if a greater proportion of blame is to be attributed to the negro again we insist that any effort to distribute responsibility in a country as large as ours and with the history that lies behind race relations becomes a futile pastime of pot and kettle exchanging invectives we come back to our old position social tensions and outright crime in the united states today are not a matter of one segment of the population alone for that reason we do not like mr fischers constant use of the phrase negro community you cannot separate criminal activity into neat compartments of one group alone while such neat divisions of responsibility may satisfy the demands of a certain type of tidy thinking they frequently fail to register the correct balance crime and its correction are the product of joint correlative action for every dope addict in harlem we can point to white pushers and white smugglers who control the trade in narcotics for every knifing and mugging we can point to an entire chain of law enforcement agencies that are an insult to community trust for every pariah on our welfare lists there stands a battery of silent partners labor racketeers rentgougers and slumlords whose power and influence keep them outside the pale of law for years on end no it is not the socalled negro community alone that must be brought to book in this indictment we americans are a people a community of white and colored with a sacred trust a public philosophy to sustain and cherish every criticism of negro failure must be examined side by side with white failure responsibility must be matched with responsibility it is too easy for one group to denounce the other to hold up standards that must be met before we agree that the negro has earned his citizenship that prize was conferred on the negro long before the editors of harpers and readers digest were born let them make sure that the nation as a whole deserves the quality of citizenship it demands of its most vexed and underprivileged minority sleight of foot magician by a s doc young n the context of maurice morning wills religious background his father is a minister his own private consideration of a postbaseball y career placing himself in a pulpit and his tremendous influence on americas youth he lectures to them frequently it was properly fitting that a little child should lead the grownups in recognizing his titanic major league talent during the summer of when the name maury wills was merely an eyebrowlifter in most baseball circles a yearold los angeles dodger fan watched with bugeyed awe as maury practiced his profession then returned home to pen this prophecy in rhyme the league will soon learn hes no one to spurn as he dazzles the crowds with his speed when he steals a base its not even a race cause he runs like a thoroughbred steed that lad whomever he was wouldve been eligible for full pardon last fall if he had thrown out his teenage chest to big daddy proportions and boasted to his friends i told you so for indubitably maury wills had confirmed his youthful poets appraisal in the short span of a single major league season maury wills turned baseballs clock all the way back to preruthian days brought the lovers of scientific baseball out of their bombshelters where theyd sought protection from a year barrage of homers with broad smiles on their faces taught dodger fans that as president walter omalley said you dont have to bump the ball over the wall to win games andif i may borrow eloquent words once spoken in tribute to joe louis by i believe the late new york mayor james j walkerplaced a beautiful rose on the grave of the georgia peach ty cobb the statistics have been recited so often that moonshiners in the tennessee hills now know them by heart displaying the most amazing sleightoffoot trick baseball has ever seen in wills stole bases in

theory that early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise aesop would have loved maury wills he would have written a book of bromides about him put it this way it is the fact of baseball as it is a fact of life that many of the sureshots never come in while some of the longshots do many of the preps voted mostlikelytosucceed arent ever heard of after the diplomas are passed out while some mousy little kid in the back row grows up to become president of a billiondollar firm many of the flashy highbonus boys of baseball fizzle in the hot glare of professional competition while an unpretentious little fellow who keeps on plugging along ignoring slights suddenly develops into the comethrough clutchman when the chips are down thats the maury wills story in a nutshell every last word of it hes the longshot who came in and paid off at milliontoone odds the los angeles dodgers lost the national league pennant he didnt in the last two pennant playoffgames with the san francisco giants while the dodgers were cutting their own throats maury stole four bases he brought home the winning run in the second game when he singled stole second went to third on a sacrifice and scored on a short fly in the final game he stole second stole third and raced home when the giant catcher threw wildly into the outfield trying to nab him in the background of these heroics there is to be found an incredible saga of dedication sticktoitiveness and big heart thats been matched seldom if ever since baseball was known as one o cat when a man appraises the hardships and disappointments that maury wills endured while striving for the major leagues of baseball if he is the sort of guy who beefs because the boss didnt say hello this morning he must be now reminded of the pointed saying i complained because i had no shoes until i met a man who had no feet maury wills is a little david whos made it big in a sport dominated by giant goliaths simply because he didnt quit as he says didnt get my diaper down when the powersthatwere continued to say youre too small youre good field no hit yesyoure pretty goodbut in when maury graduated from cardozo high school in washington d c nine colleges and universitiesincluding ohio state rutgers and syracuse dangled attractive athletic scholarship offers before him a potential a student whod make cs because like so many athletes i didnt concentrate enough on books maury passed over the offers because he was already married to his high school sweetheart gertrude elliott he was a father and at his family responsibilities dictated that he earn as much money as he could as quickly as he could hed been a fine high school quarterback quite some shucks as a prep pitcher and hed hit better than inspired by jackie robinson maury decided to seek his fortune in baseball but alas and alack after hed displayed his wares in a new york giants tryout camp at havre de grace marylandstriking out men in seven innings which is as perfect as baseball law allowsgiant scouts said he wouldnt do he was they said too small their goodbye was cordial but its effect was basically the same as an unfriendly order get out the giants like most everyone else in baseball were thinking along ruthian power lines thats understandable the ruthian influence being as dominant as it was even today maury stands only fivefootten but looks shorter weighs pounds he says but he must mean after hes taken a shower in his fulldress uniform maury was disappointed nobody can blame him for that but he didnt latch onto a persecution complex hurray he had a family to feedand blues arent edible when the dodgers then located in brooklyn held a tryout camp there he was showing em what he could do just as hed shown the giants the dodgers signed him gave him an infinitesimal bonus and ye gads they do say that dave nicholson who hit for the orioles last year was paid grand then promptly dumped him into their farm system where they forgot him for eight and a half years during that time maury bounced around like a basketball in the hands of marques haynes from hornell n y to spokane by way of pueblo colorado and some place in texas every year the dodgers looked at numerous phenoms but had no use for maury wills nobody else wanted him either incidentally maury stole bases at hornell in his first year of professional play returned to hornell in and to prove his previous seasons mark was no fluke stole another a hundred times or more during these eight and a half years as maury watched dozens of phenoms most of whom are now lodged somewhere in oblivion pass him by in a continuous parade to the parent dodger club he wondered did i do the right thing when i went into baseball he has explained it wasnt so much for myself that i was worried it would have been different if id been a single man i worried for my family i didnt want my family enduring all the hardships i had to endure finally i compromised myself stopped eating my heart out about making the major leagues and decided to make the best living i could in the minors now we dissolve to the major league season the los angeles dodgers are making a bold dash for the national league pennant they stumbled of course butwhat the heckthey were dashing boldly at one time and e j buzzie bavasi club vicepresident scoops writers at midseason by declaring that maury wills is the most valuable player on our club leo durocher a dodger coach who was himself a fine shortstop once and later the manager of two fine shortstops alvin dark and peewee reese says wills is the most versatile shortstop ive ever i seen walter omalley whod i feared hed built his million i stadium in los angeles chavez i ravine too big for his power boys i relaxes as he listens to the rafter i rattling cheers for maurys sleight i offoot tricks legions of writers i and fans compare maury wills to i the immortal ty cobb maury i wills to jackie robinson maury i wills to a forgotten national i league star bob beschler of cin i cinnati who stole bases in i to set a modern national league i record in when cobb set the alltime singleseason record of stolen bases he averaged a theft every games wills in averaged a heist every games fresco thompson covice president of the dodgers was asked to compare maury and ty its difficult to compare them said thompson because theyve played in eras where the type of game was entirely different in cobbs era one run was more important than it is in todays type of baseball where teams seem to go for the big inning believe a player who steals bases today would compare favorably with a player who stole in cobbs era this sounds like thompson is saying wills would have or could have stolen close to bases in cobbs timethat is when you remember that hes comparing thefts to thefts and in reality maury pilfered sacks in but lets be honest thompson was queried at midseason and neither he nor anyone else actually believed at that time that wills would erase ty cobbs mark a mark which for sheer effort and talent was more demanding or tougher this writer believes than babe ruths feat of home runs in the national league allstars and the american league allstars clashed in their first annual game of at washington dc wills though voted the no shortstop behind pittsburghs dick groat ran wild as of his relatives watched proudly and the national leaguers won this was the day when thanks to television and the importance of the occasion maury wills bolted into national if not international famehis performance in the world series when he outplayed chicagos thenheralded shortstop luis aparicio notwithstanding when the same two sets of allstars appeared in chicago for their second annual game of superlatives at wrigley field i corralled such creditable experts as stan musial the incomparable st louis cardinal del crandall milwaukees fine catcher and fred hutchinson manager of the cincinnati reds and asked each one for an appraisal of maury wills the thief of bases they chorused hes the best i tried to pin musial down to a shortstop comparison of wills to marty marion his old teammate stan hedged but there was no hedging about wills the baserunner crandall said the only way he knew of getting wills out was to throw to third when maury headed for second but at this time roughly midseason not every one who mentioned maury wills name conceded that he was an ecclesiastical performer subject not to critical analysis only to lavish praise which proves these fellows didnt know historyinthemaking when they saw it but who did vin scully the irrefutably great dodger broadcaster proved to be an uncompromising jackie robinson loyalist tough inadvertently he was forced to pay maury a lefthanded compliment wills is a nice little guy who steals bases robinson was a runner he had a defiance he was the only player i ever saw who could steal better when he was mad wills has everyone pulling for him to steal and cheering him when he does ive seen robinson steal when the crowd was booing and defying him to try it and furious when he succeeded bavasi enlarged on that robinson and wills are two oppositetype players robbie was more daring but not as quick nor as fast as maury one was more powerful the other is more agile and they are definitely different type hitters in my mind they were and are the most valuable players on our club so it went as the season progressed one was defiant the other nice one was more powerful the other more agile one was more daring the other quicker meanwhile jackie robinson entered the hall of fame wills became the greatest individual baseball star of the year and it all boiled down throwing the two togetherthat a stolen base was a stolen base was a stolen base incidents like those that follow enabled maury to dominate the sports year in houston on june he walked to lead off the th inning promptly stole second base sliding safely in on his belly because it was a game situation and i can save a halfstep sliding head first three pitches later he stole third with a hook slide and after willie davis flied to center he fled home scoring the winning run for the dodgers without the benefit of a hit said manager walt alston wills is the greatest basestealer ive seen in the majors in the aforementioned first major league allstar game at washington on july wills was sent in as a pinchrunner for musial whod singled in the top half of the sixth inning wills promptly stole second so cleanly that earl battey the american league catcher and a fine thrower didnt even bother with an attempt to get him out wills has explained i steal per cent of my bases on pitchers although catchers get most of the blame moments later dick groat singled and wills scampered home with the games first run when wills whod relieved groat at shortstop by this time stepped up to home plate as the leadoff batter in the eighth inning the national leaguers held a slender to lead he singled to left field as jim davenport also singled to left wills rounded second base and stopped mesmerizing rocky colavito who fielded davenports hit held the ball a costly moment then threw behind the runner to second base as soon as colavito committed himself wills took third shortly thereafter felipe alou hit a foul fly which leon wagner caught in short right field wagner may not be the worlds greatest thrower but neither is he the worlds worst and any scoring attempt by anybody or anything save greased lightning seemed strictly suicidal but the mercurial wills a positive thinker bolted home and slid deftly under john romanos frantic futile tag the national leaguers won the game to wills had scored two himself in a dodger home game against the new york mets on august wills again provided the margin of victory with his dashing feet in the sixth inning he beat out an infield single stole second advanced to third on a wild throw by met catcher chris cannizzaro and scored on willie davis infield hit wills stolen base in this game was his th of the year at this point the experts the better gamblers among them conceded that maury might erase beschlers national league singleseason record of stolen bases virtually no one not even wills himself envisioned that hed bag more how did maury wills bridge the gap between a compromise on comparative minor league oblivion and major league superstardom during the course of a fourhour taped interview for which maury is yet entitled to collect a steak dinner from the writer which sooner or later he will collect the star provided the complete answer to that question when i stole all those bases at hornell he said i ran mostly on sheer speed but as i moved up the ladder into classa aa triplea and so on i discovered that the pitchers were getting smarter they forced me to adjust they made me smarter i said fred hutchinson tells me that one reason why youre so good at stealing bases is that you get a better jump on pitchers than most runners del crandall says you study pitchers and basestealing in general more than most runners wills said yes i do study the pitchers constantly i try to detect little telltale signs little tips as to when i should take off from the movements of their heads and their shoulders their feet and that reminds me of something since that first allstar game last summer numerous reporters have asked me about basestealing and ive talked too much four pitchers made adjustments in their mannerisms on the moundthat means ive had to readjust to them but back to study i want to speak a good word for the dodgers they run a terrific training camp at vero beach every spring a campanis gives six or eight lectures on baserunning each training season i dont think ive forgotten a word ive heard him speak on the subject maury didnt mention it but when the dodger brass gave an exhaustive test dealing with various inside aspects of baseball play last spring he was the only player on the club to score i asked how important is raw sheer speed to a base bandit wills replied you have to have speed of course but the fastest runner isnt necessarily the best stealer of bases willie davis is faster than i am but im quicker the most important components of success in basestealing are knowing the pitcher knowing how to get a good lead and having the reflexes that let you get away instantly without having to think about taking off quickness and the slide i use three slides straight in with my feet extended out in front the fadeaway or hook slide and the head first slide thats when you dive into the bag on your belly to be a successful basestealer youve got to know which slide to use in a given situation he continued now ive omitted three important items desire dedication and confidence i rate desire over ability a player with mediocre ability but the great desire to excel can become a star in the major leagues but a player with great ability and no desire wont make it this is what i mean by dedication im always trying to do my job and a little extra i think all ballplayers ought to be dedicated to the game i dont believe in doing just what i have to do and letting it go at that confidence especially when youre trying to steal bases youve got to run with confidence you cannot be afraid to fail the fear of failure will keep you from being a good thief you have to be daring you cant be a safetyfirst runner and steal many bases i said youve always been a pretty good athlete starring as you did in football and basketball and baseball in high school and i would have presumed that this success would have provided you with an ample supply of confidence yet ive heard you say that there were times in the minor leagues when you lost some of your confidence when you thought of quitting wills said baseball is so full of ups and downs and heartaches and i suppose i must have wanted to quit a hundred times figuratively speaking during my years in the minors but as you know i never did my wife and iwe have five children and they have to eat when i felt down i thought about my family and my friends they were pulling for me and they wouldve been terribly disappointed if id turned out to be a quitter when things went roughly i called on my religious faithi think a ballplayer has to have a strong faith in something i was reared in church so i get my strength from religion i tried to understand that when things were going roughly for me god was testing me to see how strong my faith was i felt hurt and disappointed in the spring of when the detroit tigers purchased my contract from the dodgers on a conditional basis and then although i hit well and fielded flawlessly with them during training camp games they turned me back but i didnt get my diaper down i said to myself well im going back home to spokane to play again how could i complain when i was going back home but to tell the whole truth after the tigers turned me down i realized id lost some of my confidence bobby bragan then manager of the spokane team is the man who rebuilt my confidence hes the man most responsible for my being in the major leagues today i asked what did bobby bragan do for you specifically wills said bobby bragan did something for me that no one else had ever done he was like a father to me it wasnt so much that he showed me how to play although he was the man who made me a switchhitterand i dont carry a bigenough stick to make it in the majors without switchhittingbut what was most important to me was the way in which he talked the way he let me know he had confidence in me he told me i had the ability to go all the way to the major leagues i had thought so all along but its hard to fight a battle all alone he rebuilt my confidence as ive indicated after seven years in the minor leagues you sort of lose your confidence and you start concentrating on making a good living in the minors instead of eating your heart out about going to the majors the major key to maury wills resurgence was bragans idea of making him a switchhitterthat was done in that year maury hit only for spokane and stole only bases in games but after the tigers turned him down in he stole bases and hit in the first games of the regular pacific coast league season on the basis of this sensational performance the dodgers considered him for their own club for the first time in the eight and a half seasons he played in their system when wills arrived to join the dodgers he was so unknown that a leading writer asked maury wills whos he for a while wills had a rough time he was tense in the field he couldnt beg borrow or steal a hit eventually though he found himself the dodgers won the national league pennant and during the ensuing world series with the chicago white sox wills outplayed the great luis aparicio i said when you first came to the dodgers in you had a pretty rough time of it you found yourself and sparked the dodgers to a pennant but you werent exactly a star yet walt alston was pinchhitting for you again in how did you hurdle the final obstacle to stardom wills said youre right in what you say you know when i went to spring training camp in i thought i had it made i thought i was the dodger shortstop i thought id finally get to live with the big team at vero beach which was my ambition but i found myself starting all over again i had to win the position all over again well after the regular season began i found myself still coming out of the game in the sixth or seventh inning for a pinchhitter one day alston took me out for a pinchhitter in the third inning its embarrassing to be removed from the game for a pinchhitter in the third inning if you cant stay in the lineup any longer than that you dont have any business being in there in the first place i went to pete reiser a dodger coach and asked for help i said previously that bobby bragan was responsible for my being in the majors well pete reiser kept me there he opened my stance shortened my swing and told me to hit to the opposite field per cent of the time we worked on this days i was playing but i was still coming out in the fifth sixth or seventh inning for a pinchhitter but on the thirteenth or fourteenth day i broke loose theres a short sequel to the story i corralled reiser in los angeles and bragan in chicago i told them that maury wills had paid great tribute to them for his success in the major leagues i asked them to give me their versions of the story to tell me just what they had done for him both men neither knowing what the other had said spoke identical words about maury wills each said he did it he did it all hes the hardestworking ballplayer ive ever known i need your love so bad by fletcher dalton ie walker was returning to alabama she was seated mid way in a miserable little coach the only passenger car on the train the was the towns only train taking and bringing an average of twelve or thirteen passengers weekly except for holidays and funerals she tried to look out the window but it was so streaked and grimy that she turned to reading for the last time ever the fourpage article the national magazine had printed when her retirement from the entertainment world had been announced a few months ago leonie walker the great american negro blues singer shocked the western world last week when she announced in no uncertain terms im quitting best known for her rendition of i need your love so bad it began like all the other articles on all the other negroes who had established themselves it described her life as much of it as she had thought fit to tell them before and during her meteoric rise in the blues world it had rambled on and on filling space until it came to the line which now as it had months ago cut her to the quick the amazing thing is said one colleague that despite all her good fortune leonie has managed to retain her spirit of humility there it was thats what the whole article was about thats what it seemed to her all the articles about famous negroes boiled down to sooner or later that spirit of humility was the east coast euphemism for the despised southern that nigger knows how to stay in his place that unnamed but omnipresent white colleague had mouthed and would mouth that obscenity as long as the population ratio remained what it was that was not what bothered her it was the fact that the thing she was going to do now would make that article sound like gospel truth north south east and west it would seem like little eva coming back across the river but she couldnt stop it coming into oak grove the began its usual ritual of jerks starts and reverses before coming to a dead halt in front of the one room double partitioned in the cause of racial purity station she got up tossed the magazine onto the seat opposite pulled her traveling kit down from the rack and made her way down the aisle into the vestibule and out into the dust gravel and heat of alabama sam mrs glenvilles driver had come up the cars right here he said they shook hands glad to have you back leonie that was all it was enough she knew he meant it yes she was returning and gladly after twelve years of pleading for love on the stages of new york paris london after years of entertaining white men and women by singing those songs born of the tortures which they inflicted upon negroes and in turn paid such fabulous prices to hear oh shed packed auditoriums every program was sold out weeks in advance she autographed photographs every other day just to get ahead but she was always alone in her hotel room a funny kind of prostitution thats what it was only this was worse because the commodity was her soul they paid heavily through that pimp her manager then they entered the darkened room waiting she appeared stripped down to her bare soul flung wide her arms and alternately screamed and whispered i need your love so bad when it was over they were gone she never knew their names did not even recognize the faces of those who came more than once to see her only one thing was sure they were always confident assured of a good performance her voicethat bronze and velvet instrument as one critic called itwas her health card she noticed that sam was taking the short cut as the limousine bumped along the dusty road adding yet another layer of film to the sheets and undergarments hanging on clotheslines she reminded herself without feeling of any sort that she had no point of contact with this the black section of town she had never known a father or mother her first memory being that of playing in a wide back yard with white childrenthe yard of the house to which she was headed now shed never had a black mama to nurse to have comb and grease her hair no black papa to cuddle up to and learn the fear of god and the white man from no black brothers and sisters to run barefoot with in the hot sand no leonies heritage was her song the first time she remembered singing it was in the back yard with michael anne and susan now mr michael miss anne and miss susan and them kneeling at her feet to listen in high school she had sung it on a talent program and had swept away the prize it had launched and kept aloft her career a canarys got to sing she was fond of saying he dont know where the song came from he dont care he just keeps singin three things he dont understand his song his color and his cage he cant understand em he cant fight em and he cant lose em without dyin as they passed washington high school she thought not so much of the years she had spent there as of the years that had passed since her graduation shed returned to the glenville household as cook shed never left it of course it was just that the recognition of the difference between the blackhandinwhitehand relationship of the childhood years and the backofwhitehandacrossblackface relationship of the adult years had to be instilled as subtlety as possible this could be accomplished best so the glenvilles had felt in a negro school only somehow their strategy and her learning had failed them shed learned what they had intended she saw fear hope longing distress daily shed heard all the cruel stories as well as the cruel jokes in self defense she found out what could happen what had happened and what was happening and she armed herself like all the rest of the soldiers in her campfor defeat not victory but it didnt turn out like the experts had predicted perhaps the difference was in her marching song i need your love so bad had won out nobody else had sung a blues that day on the talent program yet leonie had won the prize nobody understood it just as nobody had understood in paris london new york shed had to repeat it everywhere they didnt understand it but they wanted to hear it over and over again perhaps they tried in the rehearing to grasp it but it escaped them nobody knew what it meant either to themselves or to her nobody that is but the glenvilles theyd understood it since that moment they knelt around her feet in their back yard to hear her sing it they knew it was more than a blues they knew it was a fundamental wail from somewhere in the blackness that shielded leonies soul they also knew that it was not directed at them or at anybody in particular and in it they recognized their own needs doubts hopes she was singing for them all it was this that made their bond indivisible they were all caught in that well of loneliness and only leonies song could give their feelings adequate expression it drew them together it made the long journey toward the light a little easier what makes these biscuits so good leonie mrs glenville would ask when they were at supper it was probably the only house in oak grove where the cook ate with the family sweat tears and a song was the answer it was always good for a laugh yet they knew the truth of it they had seen her making bread the water from her brow mixing with the water streaking her cheeks and together falling into the dough and they knew the song it was the one they heard on good days and bad it was the one she hummed when they brought to her their troubles it was the one she involuntarily sang aloud when the troubles were mutual it was the same song whether its function were lullaby lowdown blues or a hymn it was hers to give and theirs to share feeling the car change gears au tomatically she glanced out to find that they were in the oval driveway to the house that twelveroom structure which mr michael and his sisters had left long since leaving mrs glenville widowed childless and alone shell be her old self tonight thought leonie with me and the children all back yes and the grandchildren ive never seen she looked over at the newly mowed kentuckybluegrass lawn and realized that there the decision had been made to present her to the fast moving entertainment world twelve years and a half ago at a glenville family reunion on this lawn leonie had sung to the accompaniment of two guitars sams and the yard mans miss susans brotherinlaw from new york an impresario had known a good thing when he heard it and asked them to entrust their cook to his care she was willing just knocked off my feet as she had put it and her career began weil that was all over now the limousine stopped opposite the front door when she got out sam said ive got to go back downtown to pick up a few things nobodys home but the grandkids and theyre out back its all yours leonie she entered the house looking neither to the right or left not so much out of confidence as out of hope that nothing had been significantly altered since she left until she was in the dining room the note was there on the table which had been set for eight mrs glenville had written just family tonight leonie mike and his wife sue and anne and their husbands you and me leonie sighed and in that exultation swept away the memory of the last twelve years dinner was always served at five thirty she had little over an hour she made for the kitchen alone there she surveyed her old domain it was just as it had been twelve long years ago except for a new tiled floor and different curtains everything else seemed untouched the faucet still had a silent intermittent drip with an effort she could see a portion of the playground where the grandchildren were the window above the sink had not been enlarged after all she turned to the closet beside the pantry took down a starched white uniform and laid it across a chair slowly she took off her turquoise dress and hung it up after the uniform was buttoned she took from her purse a faded bandana and slowly wound it round until it covered every trace of hair from neck to forehead the flour milk salt yeast stood beside the big bowl she began to hum rolled up her sleeves and poured in the ingredients her left forearm cradled the bowl against her stomach her right hand grasped the spoon handle and began the revolutions wide at first against the edges of the bowl and then in closer and closer circles the sweat and the tears were already starting the lost pioneers by beryl decker are so few ne t groes living in rural nebraska that it is interesting to find that some did take land in the homestead days in various parts of the state like many of the white homesteaders they were handicapped by lack of capital to carry them through drouth hard times and hard winters those who were lured to cherry county by the acre kinkaids found the land of little use for farming and the homestead acreage far too small for successful ranching an effort was made by the writers project of the wpa to make a record of the negro farmer in nebraska and there are two short accounts of the settlement in cherry county in reeces history of cherry county and in reverend o j burkhardts history of the negro settlement in cherry county near brownlee the wpa writers found that as early as several families came out from omaha to file claims on sec twp range in franklin county these were the homesteads given under the first homestead act signed by president lincoln in the settlers in franklin county planned to make permanent homes on their claims for they laid out a village to be called grant and they named a nearby stream lovely creek their money gave out and they left the county within the year two groups came from tennessee to take land one group settled in hamilton county in the other group went to harlan county in hard times and hard winters discouraged both groups and they returned to tennessee a lasting settlement was made in in dawson county near overton these people were descendants of slaves who had escaped to canada via the underground railway and had evidently done very well there they had the finances to stay on their homesteads until they could get a crop and to make the necessary improvements on their land to get the patents after the residence stipulation had been met in eight of these families disposed of their dawson county holdings and led the way to cherry county they crossed the platte river and trailed through the sandhills in covered wagons to ten miles north west of brownlee to file claims to acre homesteads roy brown of valentine nebraska thinks that his father george brown took the first homestead in the area on sec twp range in he was soon followed by dawson county neighbors william walker albert riley george riley c h mehan joshua emanuels j a hatters and william crawford they staked out their claims built their soddies and settled down to living in a wilderness with few roads few fences few trees and hills with much less grass on them than is there now seth hanna long time rancher in cherry county thinks that the first claim was made by a negro railroader clem deaver deaver may have heard of this large tract of unclaimed land when he was in seneca a booming railroad town at that time seth thinks that deaver may have alerted other negroes to the opportunity in land for they soon came from other nebraska towns lincoln schuyler alliance north platte and broken bow they came from other states ohio indiana kansas and missouri roy brown says that at one time there were over a hundred families in the colony it is stated in the reece history of cherry county that by homesteads had been taken by negroes this was more than acres of land beginning miles northwest of brownlee it lay for miles on either side of the north loup river some of it was the best land in the county on the other hand joshua emanuels land was such a blowout that they dubbed it emanuels desert they named their sod post office dewitty after the first postmaster mail was brought in daily from seneca they added a store building to their post office ed white who has run a store at brownlee for many years says that they used to purchase merchandise from his store to sell from the dewitty store school districts and were organized in an area where there were no white settlers later another district was organized for both white and negro children goldie and fern walker became school teachers goldie who became mrs w r hayes taught in the rural schools of cherry county and south dakota all of her life her last teaching was in she was an excellent teacher her schoolrooms were very very clean and had carpets on the floors and white curtains and the best of all equipment that she could persuade school boards to purchase she put on many fine musical programs with her pupils after she moved to valentine in she was a member of the m e church choir for many years before her death in the rev mr o j burkhardt a missionary evangelist of the african methodist episcopal church visited the colony and helped them organize a church they built it across the river about a mile from their post office it was made up of many denominations who forgot their differences and worked together for the common good their first pastor the rev mr w h mance from topeka took a homestead where the parsonage was built he remained long enough to get a patent for his claim the next pastor the rev mr william kerby from kansas city also took a claim and proved up on it before he left the settlers from dawson county were used to farming and continued to farm in cherry county they knew little of crop rotation and other means of crop improvement roy brown says they corned it to death with a little more capital and knowhow of stock raising some of them could have developed successful ranches the rileys stuck it out until when albert sold out and moved to valentine to work for the niobrara wild life reserve he remained at this work for twenty years when he retired and moved to danver his son albert of valentine says that the hard times of the s forced his father to give up his land cows were bringing and corn cents a bushel they couldnt make a living at those prices some very able mechanics such as carpenters and masons were among the negro colony both men and women worked wherever they could get it from other ranchers to add to the income they could get from their land eddie ford walked seven miles night and morning to and from a ranch job robert hannahs rode his horse to brownlee every friday to open his barber shop by sunday evening he had taken care of his customers at brownlee and the surrounding countryside and rode back to his home several men are still living in the area who were barbered by hannahs and some remember going as children to his home for their haircuts old settlers who lived in the county at the time of the negro settlement speak of them as good citizens good workers good musicians and good baseball players they brought color and gaiety to the usual drabness of pioneer life there was music for all occasionsdances fairs fourth of july celebrations and the threeday rodeo at brownlee when the negroes were there the price brothers made up one orchestra and there were other groups of players their instrumentation was violin guitar mandolin and piano boss woodson was a fine singer as well as a mandolin player it sounded like an organ when mr and mrs c spees sang together in the congregational church at thedford old settlers say it was an entertainment treat for them to go to the negro dances to watch their beautiful dancing when they got together for a dance in the town hall roy brown says that most of them played by ear they would get a phonograph record and listen to it over and over until they could play it a few could play it after one hearing teams from thedford and brownlee played their baseball team the negroes not only played ball but entertained the spectators all the while with clowning along with their playing four young men from the colony served the country in world war i w r hayes joseph boyd mckinley boyd and glen hannahs all returned to their homes but boyd had spent so much time in wet trenches that he never fully recovered his health a few of these settlers lived on their land for a quarter of a century others relinquished their rights for what they could get as soon as they were able they didnt like rural life or couldnt make a living there others held on to get the patents to the land and then sold out others mortgaged the land and lost through not being able to meet interest payments the cattlemen who bought the land had come to the sandhills in the days of the free range and had learned what could be done with those hills while riding for other outfits they had learned that it wasnt farm land and that it takes thousands of acres to make a ranch they usually had a little capital and a few cattle when they took their kinkaids they picked up other land as they were able until they had a ranch sothe corned to death land has gone back to prairie sod the soddies have been destroyed by wind cattle and moisture such frame buildings as there were have been hauled away by the new owners most of the negroes have gone to the cities omaha denver kansas city st louis or to the west coast all that remains is the cemeteryprobably a dozen unmarked graves in one of seth hannahs pastures some are buried at brownlee and memories remain for the old settlers of a good people gay and lighthearted in trying circumstancesand memories for the negroes of the great good times they had down there that roy brown speaks of the untold story of open housing in suburbia by bill boone park forest a middleclass suburb of chicago the james robinson family moved quietly and almost uneventfully into their newlybought home integrating what was formerly an allwhite community the only incident which the robinsons and park forest residents now recall with humor was an almost bazaar enactment of a scene from a silent movie a day before the robinsons moved in unknown but suspected youthful pranksters painted their wooden fence black the following day police and other residents appeared with buckets and brushes in hand apologized to the robinsons and repainted the fence white in hastings ranch an upperclass suburb of los angeles mr and mrs albert morris a retired professional couple have lived peacefully in their pleasant surroundings since august we have made delightful friends and we like the area says mrs morris there was some opposition shortly after the morrises moved in almost persons met to block the first negro familys move into the allwhite suburb the course of action chosen by the majority was to accept the single occurrence but to socially reject the morrises and work to keep other negro families out dissenting from the majority were two individuals members of a fair housing group who thought differently and went to work to change attitudes shortly afterwards a second meeting was called under the new auspices and persons attended to welcome the morrises to hastings ranch in boston air force captain and mrs g b tracy and family were desirous of moving to the suburbs for the usual reasons better schools fresh air back yard barbecues etc after locating a house through the clearing house office maintained by the fair housing federation of greater boston they drove out to talk with the owner who felt obligated to consult his neighbors before selling after sampling the opinions of neighbors which were about equal in regard to accepting a negro family as neighborsthe owner decided to sell assured by the owner and the suburbs fair housing committee that although there may be some stresses and strain there would be no violent reactions the tracys moved in there were no serious problems their two children went to local schools and have encountered no discrimination some neighbors have ignored the tracys but most were friendly and welcoming and as predicted by members of the fair housing committee several of the neighbors who were opposed to the tracys buying have now become good friends in levittown new jersey more than families have integrated that suburban area without incident peaceful integration of hundreds of negro families in suburban boston philadelphia and washington have occurred with scant notice from the press the examples go on and on in suburbs villages and townships hundreds of negro families have yielded to suburbia fever and have fled the overcrowded ghetto areas for the same reasons as their white counterparts over the past five years the incidence of peaceful and harmonious integration of previously allwhite areas has been occurring with increasing frequency in practically all areas in the united states above the mason dixon line how has this receptive atmosphere come about through what avenues or agencies may a negro buyer find housing in the suburbs why have there been little or no publicity about the peaceful moveins are enough negroes taking advantage of this open door policy the answer to the last question is not nearly enough according to the reports of many whites and nonwhites working for open occupancy in suburbia in fact many feel the negro is still too reluctant still too fearful of making the move even though studies and polls point out that the negro wants and needs better housing and the advantages suburban living offers many persons most of whom are whites working for residential integration go so far as to say it is the negros duty to move into the areas now made or being made available to him that he should take advantage of this opportunity after he and so many others have fought for open occupancy and other white members of such housing groups who have tired of seeking and trying to persuade negro families to move to the suburbs throw up their hands in frustration and despair and withdraw their efforts with the attitude if they dont want to come well what is all this talk about discrimination and racism but to answer the above questions in order the receptive atmosphere in hundreds of suburban areas is being created by the increasing number of fair housing groups springing up all over the united states they may be called fair housing committees human relations councils friends suburban housing home home opportunities made equal or by various other names they may be a part of or cooperate with existing human relations groupspublic and privatewhich are working in the housing field but the general purpose of all of them is to make possible for every man the equal opportunity to obtain housing without regard to race religion or national origin but as pointed out in trends in housing a publication of the national committee against discrimination in housing an organization of associated groups who have successfully fought on the national level for equal housing the various fair housing groups concern goes beyond the effort to guarantee the right of minorities to move freely into any neighborhood they desire and can afford they actively promote residential integrationwhether a fair housing practices law applies to their community or not they are committed to the proposition that integrated communities are socially healthy politically desirable and economically sound if they live in an allwhite community they want it to become integrated if they live in an integrated community they want to keep it that way these grassroots organizations are interested in general improvement of housing conditions but they are not trying to meet housing needs per se and since their purpose is to maintain residential in tegration they may search for the white as well as the nonwhite homeseeker as a result they fight to combat unethical real estate agents since such tactics almost always create other segregated areas many of these organizations limited their activities almost exclusively to opening up housing for negroes in the suburbs since it is believed that the suburb is where the solution to the housing problem lies too violence most often occurs in fringe areas just two to three blocks from a negro ghetto where blockbusters used in the derogatory sense have incited suspicion and fear within the white areas near the ghetto credit for the present breakthrough in the suburbs as well as in certain allwhite areas in cities must also go to the presence of fair housing laws on various states statutes and to such organizations as the above mentioned ncdh which since has played a central role in the movement toward equal opportunity in housing according to margaret fisher editor of trends in housing its constituents include the principal religious civic labor and civil_rights groups which are dedicated to the proposition that equal opportunity to bargain in an open competitive market for shelter is a basic constitutional and moral right of every american another organization religiously oriented and which has pioneered in equal housing opportunity and in helping to create a receptive atmosphere for nonwhites in allwhite areas is the american friends service committees housing opportunity program a committee of the friends community relations program the housing arm has worked for several years toward the basic goal of expanding areas for nonsegregated living by working with members of the housing industry and with concerned citizens and organizations but the most recent acts that have given a moral as well as a legal impetus to open occupancy was president kennedys long awaited stroke of the pen and federal housing administrator robert c weavers directive that prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of fha and va financed housing although activities of the local fair housing groups may vary somewhat their pattern of operation is usually the same the decision is somehow made by several people or groups in the allwhite community to work toward integrated housing on at least one occasion trend reports the motivation came from a welladministered shock by a fouryearold a suburban housewife and her young son met an elegant and distinguished negro woman at the home of a friend mommie queried the fouryearold whose maid is that that night a group of friends met at the womans home to talk about what white suburbia was doing to our children and what we could do about it a fair housing committee was organized on the spot after such a group is formed a query in the form of an open occupancy petition or fair housing pledge is circulated in the community from the petitions can be determined the feeling of the community and therefore how much work must be done to create a receptive mood or atmosphere it must be noted that the petition is not circulated as a poll since the individual members know that the right of an individual to buy a house cannot depend on a vote of the neighbors too experience of the groups prove that whites refuse to sign the petition or pledge or indicates he is opposed to nonwhites as neighbors is likely to change his position after meeting the newcomers since no subterfuge is used in selling to nonwhites homes are shown to prospective customers in broad daylight no quota system is set although friends suburban housing one of the only such groups that actually is a licensed real estate firm limits the number of houses to minority group families in one neighborhood for fear of further segregation within the suburb in addition to maintaining listings for available housing the fair housing groups sponsor rumor clinics workshops on the housing problem or intergroup relations organize forums or speakers bureaus to combat the popular misconceptions about the negro and property values usually backed by or working in conjunction with the church or other civic organizations the various councils also prevail upon village officials and law enforcement agencies to cooperate with them and to assist them whenever necessary and although law enforcement officers in the example of park forest might have gone beyond the call of duty other communities have reported full cooperation by police in protecting the rights of all citizens and some law enforcement offices in several communities like park forest and skokie illinois announced these intentions publicly in addition to actively seeking out negro families interested in moving to a suburban community the councils also supply white checkers for nonwhite applicants who are running into difficulty securing accommodations and in many cases locate cooperative real estate agencies for the prospective buyers outside of the aforementioned friends suburban housing which was also organized for the purpose of promoting residential integration fsh has sold homes mostly in allwhite areas to negroes in the philadelphia suburban communities the councils are predominantly nonprofit and manned by volunteers the listing services are free and are maintained for the purpose of facilitating direct communication between the home seeker and the owner or landlord this also serves to bypass the restrictions imposed by discriminatory real estate practices what must be added is the fact that the fair housing councils do not attempt to force a seller to sell or a negro to buy the aim of these groups is to meet the need and desires of the homeseeker with appropriate available housing and adds arthur smith of levittown n j cochairman of the burlington county human relations council and a negro we are much interested in having this integrated housing come about in the right way as we are in just having this come about this means no blockbusting techniques no scare selling no panic and no violence why has there been little publicity on peaceful moveins as one member of a fair housing council stated just as one often reads news of divorce but rarely of happy marriages so one frequently hears of hostility and violence when a negro family moves into a previously allwhite neighborhood but rarely learns of peaceful and harmonious integration little publicity on the successful moveins can also be attributed to the policy of the various councils which regard the purchase or sale of a home a private and personal decision secondly the process of creating a receptive atmosphere or attitude of acceptance in a community requires thoughtful frank discussion by concerned individuals both of which may be made more difficult if not impossible by publicity or published statements by the more radical elements in a community perhaps partly decause of this unpublicized progressas well as many other reasonsthere is in many communities more available housing than nonwhite families to fill them according to ncdh why is this so especially since negroes have been knocking on the housing barrier and with greater force in the past few years why do they not take advantage of the open door to the suburbs or is open occupancy in housing only an issue for airing grievances against whites and not to be taken advantage of when the openings come the reasonssome might call them argumentsare valid say many negroes who have addressed themselves to the question first of all there is fear a very real and valid fear of moving into the suburbs away from people of the same racial background and experience negroes homes have been bombed or vandalized and the newcomers harassed although this has happened only relatively few times in suburban areas but as stated earlier such acts of violence and hate usually are publicized more and are remembered more readily than the numerous peaceful incidents secondly there are those for whom the suburbs hold no fascination to them the better school yard space and fresh air is no compensation for the cost and trouble of commuting back and forth to work negro families falling into this group perhaps should not be mentioned but they are to be distinguished from those who vocally share these same sentiments but later move into an allnegro suburb sometimes farther away than comparable white suburbs perhaps the thought of leaving relatives friends and people of similar interests and experiences is the most oftenheard reasons why negro families remain unattracted to suburban living this reason of course erroneously implies that there will be no families in the suburbs with similar interests background and experiences the fact is according to the case history of negro families who have moved to the suburbs their background interests and professions were more similar to those in their new community outside of different racial experiences other factors were quite surprisingly similar what about schooling will the negro child be discriminated against or hurt through being the only nonwhite in the classroom or school how will his being a minority affect him psychologically from the experiences of several negro parents with children of school age the record shows the youngsters are readily accepted by both teachers and pupils in at least one case a suburban mother said her children were treated almost like celebrities by other students and teachers and that her only fear was the effects of the abundance of attention her children were receiving the psychological effects of being a minority in a school are perhaps longreaching subtle and difficult to assess and may depend on the parents attitude and teachings in the home in regard to racial matters and human values but the opportunity for varied racial experiences it must be recalled have been among the motivations behind many of the fair housing councils efforts to integrate their community is it unlikely to assume that such interracial experience will also benefit the negro child responding perhaps defensively perhaps with resentment to such urgings to move to suburbia other negroes say we lived together in the city and you fled from me why do you want me to live with you now the same question has been put another way why do whites consider a school that is per cent negro as intolerable so they move away and one that is per cent white as integrated perhaps no better person could answer that question than harry teshima of park forest a japaneseamerican whose wife and children are longtime residents of the area says teshima who was instrumental in getting the first negro family into park forest i refuse to take the blame for those people you may be speaking about for not all people in the suburbs fled from negroes many moved out of their former neighborhoods to the suburbs for the same reason i believe negroes want to move out of the enforced ghettoes many negroes ive talked to say they dont necessarily want integration but equality of opportunity in america how can you have equality of opportunity and not have integration still another factor in the negros fear of the suburbs is the misconception about suburban living according to the experiences of some fair housing council members many negroes believe housing is cheaper and taxes are lower this is not always true in addition commuting if one works in the city is an inevitable fact that usually frightens a citydweller considering moving to suburbia then there are rumors usually false rumors that discourage potential home buyers what advice would you give to families who are thinking about moving to the suburbs a newlyarrived negro suburban housewife was asked dont listen to relatives and friends she said the rumors mostly unfounded and distorted were related to her after she had talked to friends about her familys planned move to a particular suburb her fears on moving into the new home were multiplied she said and every car every strange sound chilled her later she found the rumors to be either false or completely distorted the responsibilities and tasks voluntarily assumed by members of these local fair housing councils are difficult and at times disappointing its members have discovered but as indicated by the growing number of fair housing councils and the hundreds of successful moveins in many areas the efforts being made are not futile the successful examples prove that the door to the suburb is open to negro houseseekers and that there are hundreds of fairminded conscientious americans who are helping to hold it ajar introducing the concept by william barrow birth of a new theater is an event usually as sad hopeful sad in most cases to a brief lifetime as it is because it is predoomed outside of new york city professional or semiprofessional little theater has seldom survived more than a few seasons in this country there have been some exceptions and a notable one is clevelands karamu house and that is where the hopefulness comes in with each new start of a local theater there is hope that it will find anchor grow and become what those who delivered it into life envision for it in detroit a city with a long history of little theater starts another enfant little theater is alive and kicking it is called the concept or concepteast and there is reason to harbor hopes for its future the concepts founder and director is woodie king jr a multitalented young man who believes thatthrough artit is possible to begin the allimportant task of changing america of helping the nation to realize its limitless potential he is an actor having appeared in a raisin in the sun the death of bessie smith and several other productions and he is a writer his short story beautiful light and black our dreams will appear in the june issue of negro digest the concept is a nonracial theater meaningin this case that it will be consciously concerned with ignoring the usual restrictions of race and color to this end the theaters first production was study in color a series of three oneact plays by the rev mr malcolm boyd the episcopal chaplain at wayne state university and an energetic detractor of racists in study in color the actorsone negro and one whitechange their colors by way of masks and turn the racial tables the play was selected for publication in best plays of dodd mead co detroit is experiencing something of a cultural nascence see negro digest november and the concept promises to serve as showcase for the work of local dramatists the theaters announcement of plays for the season includes work by king ann coleman hershel steinhart and ronald milner it also promises a dance program by jimi hunt exdunham dancer and an experimental project by lee ivory called spoofs in spades the most ambitious undertaking schedule for the concept is a production of frenchman jean genets the blacks an extraordinarily sophisticated and difficult play which has been enjoying an offbroadway success for two years directoractor king has the support of some of the citys most experienced theater people including david rambeau gil maddox phil purcell dick smith beldon raspberry sylvia king dick marsh ronald milner cliff frazier and elaine jackson he also has the assistance of an advisory board that includes influential citizens among them are the rev mr boyd dr broadus n butler see the article the time is now on page congressman and mrs charles diggs jr dr charles wright mrs celia turner dr lionel swan charles ellington and mrs mozell goins the concept itself is located in a small renovated section of a building on the edge of the downtown loop and has a seating capacity of its walls are hung with paintings by local artists most of them for sale the close cooperation among artists writers and actors in the city is reflected in the concept director king is interested in seeing new plays and budding playwrights can contact him in detroit at the concept east adams those plays which are performed or which become a part of the theaters repertory will receive a perperformance royalty for their authors he indicated as is generally true with new theaters and new theater groups the concept is the offspring of several other groups collaborations and ideas kings first association with father boyd was in an experimental theater called the unstabled the priest wrote a sketch called boy an experience in the search for identity in which he played the part of a negro and king portrayed a white man the production was the forerunner of study in color in recent years detroit has delivered unto the national scene a number of first rate artists including painter hughie leesmith directoractor lloyd richards and metropolitan opera tenor george shirley and there is hope in the city that the cultural nascence will produce other extraordinary artists hopes are riding on the concept to achieve this success in the realm of the theater home to africa by saunders redding he story is told that aii when that flinty old ii scholar writer and world traveler dr w kjr landed in ghana in at the invitation of president kwame nkrumah he lowered himself to his knees and kissed the mother earth of africa the story is probably apocryphal it is hard to imagine dubois doing anything so contrary to the character he has given himselfand the world has acceptedfor threequarters of a century but when i raised the objection the british highechelon civil servant who was returning to his post in africa after home leave and who claimed to have witnessed this act of obeisance replied ah but africa does some strange things to you people although i instinctively resented what struck me as condescendence in the phrase you people i did not dispute the assertion i had heard other incredible stories of the transforming power of africa including some about going native and taking to the bush but as our plane banked into the approach pattern over dakar senegal all i really know was that my curiosity about africa was excited almost beyond tolerable measure it had been excited before by other places and many people and i hope it will be excited again but this time it was different africa had been a vague troubling presence in my imagination for nearly as long as i can remember like most americans of my generation i had had the wrong learning about africa and like most negro americans had never felt any pride in what i had been uncritically taught to believe indeed the oppositewhich i think was probably intended i was ashamed that africans were rated the lowest of the human species that once captured and sold into bondage often by other africans they took happily to slavery as if it was their natural condition that they lived in mud huts went naked and ate human flesh and that africa was the white mans graveyard so wasnt i glad that my ancestors had been brought from that benighted landthat dark continentand i could enjoy the blessings of civilization i could not then say forty years ago but i could now counter that question with another what blessings dakar was a refueling stop and as we walked toward the dimlit in transit lounge i turned to my wife arent you going to kiss the ground i said at three oclock in the morning a cool breeze was blowing off the ocean we were moving with a sluggish stream of people mostly white and the language we heard was french besides my wife said looking around what makes you think were in africa well its a state of mind i said we were joking of course but both of us were right nothing made me think of africa until at twothirty in the afternoon we reached lagos nigeria at our stop in accra which is the capital of the most african of black african countries the sense of africa i might have had was diluted by the presence of more britishers than blacks at the airport they were what is frequently pictured as the ubiquitous colonialtype britisherstarched khaki shorts pyramids of service ribbons pinned to the breasts of shortsleeved belted tunics ruddy cheeks mustaches slateblue eyes blond wives and blond children tugging and yapping at darkskinned nannies the scene at the airport brought back sharp memories of poona nagpur and jubbulpore the sun dazzling on the low louvered cement buildings the heat the red dust powdering the foliage and rising in great funnelclouds in the wind of prop washall of it might have been in the central plain of india in the dry season in the best days of the british raj but blackskinned hostesses met the plane at lagos with a minimum of fuss black officials ushered us through customs and policemen almost the color of their dark blue woolen shirts waved our car into the swollen tide of traffic moving cityward because our skins were pale to theirs we were not negroes nor for all the proof of passports american europeans they called us with the accent on the second syllable and at dinner that night at the mainland hotel it did not occur to the waiter to offer us the african menu we ate europeanpotage du jour brussels sprouts irish potatoes english mutton danish pastry nevertheless we were in africa all right and specifically in the capital of the largest independent country south of the sahara the african summit meeting was about to take place there and almost the first african i met on his home groundsa civil engineer with the hybrid name of james wellington ogu educated at rugby and cambridgenoting that africans had taken over the european hotels at least for the duration of the meeting remarked that the whites had all but fled from this new manifestation of the black mans concert and his will to power i think perhaps mr ogu overstated it the hottest most humid weather had come it was a good time for short leaves and the inviting mountain heights of jos were only a few hours away so what one saw everywhere were proud black faces gleaming atop billowing rich robes over the collar insignia of smart uniforms and above the tidy knots of ties tailored in bond street what one heard were yoruba ibo hausa swahili and oneself addressedfrench and english the native markets swarmed spotting europeans a block away slicksters sidled up to offer ivory beads swiss watches german cameras the main streets were gay with bunting and often shrill with the piping of uniformed school children marching four abreast to the rhythms of their own pure voices along the marina the flagdraped portraits of the heads of state of the monrovia powers looked sternly down on guards of honor shining official cars and soldiers frozen at the gates of government compounds and at stations every fifty feet along the palmlined thoroughfare the summit meeting which was convoked with restrained enthusiasm and great dignity by sir abubakar tafawa balewa prime minister of nigeria did not resolve any of those problems that african leaders themselves call pressing it did not level tariff barriers or standardize african railroads or decide on an intraafrica monetary system to certain biased unofficial observers including afrikaners portuguese and a clutch of sir roy welenskys bluster boys it proved only that africa is nationsand increasingly more of them to such observers africa is nations inevitably and naturally divided by ethnic groupings by language and culture by territorial boundaries and by sociopolitical alignments with various parts of the nonafrican world it is true of course that africa is caucasoid and negroid hamitic and semitic it is coptic priest and pagan priestess moslem christian hindu and animist it is portuguese exclave the french community the british commonwealth and the still undissolved central african federation in short africa would appear to be an irresoluble clash and confusion of native and foreign values and the inherited prejudices of nearly all the nations of europe and one who looked to the summit meeting for proof of this might have thought he found it in the declination of the casablanca group ghana guinea mali egypt and algeria to attend and mr nkrumahs denunciation of the monrovia powers but he would have been deceived i think for the one thing the summit meeting seemed to make clear is that in spite of diversity and all the appearances of fragmentation africa is nations committed and bound in spiritual congregation to the idea of panafrica it is not quite the old idea for with the emergence of the independent arab states north of the sahara it has taken on new political dimensions as a political idea it had not been conceived twentyfive years ago and what it means to bourguiba king hassan and ben bella is something quite different from what it meant then as a political idea panafrica faces problems that europe has failed to solve in all the years of onagain offagain effort since napoleon it envisions nothing less than what has been variously called a united states of africa a concert of africa and a parliament of africa in deference to this the new constitution for morocco overwhelmingly approved just recently plays down arab unity and declares that morocco will have among its prime objectives the realization of african unity surely too ethiopias and tunisias membership in the monrovia group of states which are all but solid black and moroccos and algerias membership in the casablanca groupalso all but solid blackhave the same objective and meaningthat is the political union of the african continent but the evidence available to an american negro visitor to subsahara africa suggests that this may be the least of the meanings in that region where the concept of panafrica is deeply involved with the idea of racethe black race it is an emotional involvement that confuses recent history and confounds political thought one cannot avoid the feeling of unhappy ambivalence that is provoked when in the same speech dr nnamdi azikiwe governorgeneral of nigeria says take the individual prophets of panafricanism and it will be found that in all cases they are ethnocentric in their ideas and concepts of panafricanism when edward wilmot blyden preached the projection of the african personality he had at the back of his mind the black inhabitants of africa the same may be said of burghardt dubois of america mojola agbebi of nigeria jomo kenyatta of kenya javabu of south africa kwame nkrumah of ghana and leopold senghor of senegal that and then this my considered views are that panafricanism has come to stay and it will yet be a shining example to the rest of the world how people of different races divergent cultures and diversity of languages can live together in political unity in one continent not being a seer i can only prophesy that panafricanism is destined to be feasible destined to be feasible whether a bright hope or a desperate who can say and who can saym whether the apparent race bias of president nkrumahs struggle for black africas regenerationpolitically socially economically within the milieu suited to the communal pattern of african society which is the foundation of panafricanism is corrected by the casablanca group which nkrumah himself called into being there is little to wonder at but much to understand that out of an overwhelming emotional need unsatisfied for half a millenium offices of africanization are set up and staffed ethnic symbols and myths are ever more viable western cultural authority courageously challenged and the prestige of whiteness diminished everywhere in black africa as an old idea the association that clung to panafrica were ethnic and as dr azikiwes speech made clear its prophets were ethnocentric if it meantas it certainly didafrica for black africans it also meant hope in black africas future and a resurrectionno a new birthof pride in its past as an old idea panafrica had been made respectable to me by my experience as a negro in america long before african intellectuals of the stature of leopold senghor and alioune diop elaborated it and the west indian poet aime cesaire refined out of it the mystique negritude and nkrumah gave it fresh utterance at the allafrican peoples conference in and long long before elijah poole the american negro who now calls himself elijah muhammad screamed it as a battle cry for mindless violenttongued revolutionaries to echo and gather to panafrica was an assertion of the common cultural heritage of all black menwhich as i saw it certainly included me since a cultural history is proclaimed everywhere to be the unassailable testimonial to the dignity and worth of a people and since by definition i was excluded from the cultural heritage that should have been mine by right of birth panafrica was the door through which fulfillment gleamed yet so frustrating and divisive was the learning of my youth and so charismatic the projection of the american dream when that door was opened at the allafrican writers conference in uganda last spring i could not enter through it of the black african writers most likely to be known to the west only leopold senghor peter abrahams and the ailing and aging amos tutuola were missing chinua achebe ezekiel mphahlele gabriel okara wole soyinka amadou samb bloke modisane thirtytwo in all representing the finest writing talent in africa were there there were four americans and of the several british at least four were publishers or publishers representatives including the poet langston hughes who is negro and the novelist robie macauley who is the editor of the kenyon review we americans were guests and our participation in the conference was appropriately lowkeyed the british had a somewhat different status difficult to explain but supported by the fact that they were there on business they were scouting the conference for publishable manuscripts and they were prepared to announce that a group of publishersbritish and americanwould sponsor a competition for the best novel by a black african on an african theme knowledge of this however was a wellkept secret it was to be the piece de resistance of the cultural feast to come as a surprise in next to the last plenary session having been let in on it in strict confidence i had three or four days in tingling expectation of a joyous reaction almost as if the competition was a project devised of my own thoughtful generosity many of the sessions had been taken up with questionsmore complex and more passionately discussed than i make them seem nowof the african writers audience which is limited and the cold indifference of the nonafrican world to africas literary aspirations the announcement i thought happily would be satisfaction of a real complaint i rather expected a spontaneous cheer but i was mistaken in supposing that the silence that followed was the speechlessness of ecstasy the dark sensitive intelligent faces over which i had watched animation play for nearly a week were immobile and impassive the silence was a challenge to a code i had learned so thoroughly that i had ceased to think of it i did not know the depth and substance of my african friends pride i had been taught that at the very least one should look thankful for even gestures of small favors from an all too casual and perfunctory white world i looked toward langston hughes but he was far down the table and opposite me robie macauleys head was lowered and i could not see his face plainly though the publishers were puzzled and i guessed hurt by this indifference to their charitable intentions it was not quite indifference someone asked a question when did the competition open close there were other questionsneutral routine products of politeness gradually however i could sense a subterranean flow of thought and feeling i could not guess then who will judge this competition the answer was that since they the publishers were primarily interested in a nonafrican audience the judges would be nonafrican suddenly all the writers were talking at once i will not try to relate all that was said for indeed i cannot but the gist was this it is all very well for european publishers to establish a rich prize for us africans to compete for and we thank thembut what are these publishers expectations essentially nonafrican perhaps they do not understand the insidiousness of this our standards reflecting our own values and ideals are different from theirs and until they accept our standards we can have no pride in our accomplishments as africans and no hope that the dignity of black men is recognized although colonial despotism has forced us to use their language our standards of expressiveness are different from theirs our imaginations work differently from theirs and are not inspired by the same realities they make certain assumptions about experience that we do not make nor ever will make they would have us disregard the new political sanctions that have come with independence and that encourage black artists and writers to be creative according to the standards and tastes of our own people will competing for this prize assure our cultural rebirth indeed will it not have the opposite effect and if this is not a hazard who are the europeans to judge us by our own standards and expectations if it is their mind to favor us then let it be on our own terms let them know that african nationalism the african personality and negritude are adequate to inspire black writers and artists with themes and to creative works justified by the authority of a black audience let us define our own genius stated with a blunt eloquence of passion that i have completely failed to convey this was the argument this was panafrica both in spirit and in word there was no discourtesy in itno fleer of sarcasm no intentional sharp anger of reproof it was simply triumphant and it moved its darkskinned audience to triumphant cries of hear hear and to surges of spontaneous applause that were not meant to be a reproach to an american negro guests pallid conception of his negroness i felt small gutted wretched i was locked out of the brotherhood of blacks by the terms used to define the black brotherhood confronted by this palpable african presence i was neither american nor black i was no one america had not made me real in the sense that africa had made real the men my elbows touched on either side they were substance i was shadow the african personality and negritude were no longer a myth compounded by a mystique again my eyes stole toward langston hughes but i still could not see his face across from me robie macauley looked withdrawn and remote from the american scholar jazz at the by leonard feather n philadelphia a i d few months ago jazz singer dakota staton filed suit in a federal sewh district court against the leader of the black muslim cult she claimed that a new york disc jockey had denounced her a new jersey nightclub proprietor had refused to book her because he feared he would be boycotted and various other misadventures had befallen her because many associated her with the cults advocacy of negro nationalism this was happening miss staton declared because the public was confusing the black muslims with the orthodox moslem faith of which she and her husband are devout advocates in clarksdale mississippi according to a recent issue of jet the most popular recording on the juke box at aaron henrys fourth street drugstore was a white mans heaven is a black mans hell the tune written by two black muslims was getting more plays than records by ray charles in los angeles new york and wherever he has appeared for the past few years dizzy gillespie has regaled audiences with anecdotes before each tune stories about mississippi the john birch society his own overseas tours we wrote this next one on our recent trip to africa where we were busy making apologies for the state department and a mock admonition to his white listeners you better be ready cause were fixin to take over the world these reflections of contemporary american society focus attention on two central facts that the american public black and white alike is more raceconscious than at any time since the civil war and that the american negro fed up with a hundred years of being told lets not be hasty is finding common cause with the nonwhite people who make up a majority of the worlds population the new militancy of the negro has naturally found its way to jazz and by an ironic turn is making itself felt in a reversal of the prevailing roles of white and negro in our country in socalled crow jim an antiwhite racial barrier on the occasion of the gifted white saxophonist brew moores departure for europe because he could not find work in or around the san francisco area jazz columnist ralph gleason wrote racial lines are now drawn much more strongly than ever before in jazz clubs are reluctant to hire any white groups except the top few eastern record companies specializing in jazz record almost no white musicians at all these days and have in several instances turned down nationally known jazz figures for recording dates because they were the wrong color hand in hand with this goes the claim by some musicians that jazz is the progeny of the negro race and is totally alien to the white man in stockholm a famed and respected american negro jazz musician told reporter bjorn fremer the negro has a long inherited tradition in jazz its his music white people have no right to play it its a colored folk music white society has its own tradition like the polka this is the kind of music that it should concentrate on the negros ascendancy in jazz if put in less extreme terms would seem indisputable yet there are pervasive and persistent contradictions how when and where white musicians became involved in jazz and the degree to which they made an original contribution to the form cannot be determined at this historical distance years elapsed before students became sufficiently concerned with the birth of jazz to do substantial research and by this time most of the witnesses of the early innovators were dead senile or totally unreliable contradicting each other according to personal prejudices curiously enough none other than louis armstrong points to a white origin for jazz in an autobiography called swing that music he wrote four years before i learned to play the trumpet the first great jazz orchestra was formed in new orleans by a cornet player named dominic la rocca his orchestra had only five pieces but they were the hottest five pieces that had ever been known before la rocca named this band the old dixieland jazz band actually the original dixieland jazz band the band has gone down in musical history la roccas fame as one of the great pioneers of syncopated music will last a long long time as long i think as american music lives in contrast a white jazz historian marshall stearns devotes three chapters of his book the story of jazz to its musical roots in africa and the west indies he asserts that around the turn of the century more than a decade before the events mentioned by armstrong playing jazz was integrated with the everyday life of the negro community that the contribution of the negro gave minstrelsy its vitality and that minstrelsy and ragtime collided in the s the former serving as a training ground for early jazzmen nick la rocca himself provides a good example of the oldtimer with a personal bias before he died a few years ago he worked closely with the author of a book called the story of the original dixieland jazz band la rocca virulently resented negro successes in jazz and as a consequence there is scarcely any mention of negro musicians in this book if one relied solely on the evidence of the book it would appear that jazz was a fairhaired baby indeed yet stearns suggests that white players only imitated the negro musicians of the time reporting that around in new orleans at the ranch cabaret according to a negro musician who worked there the white kids who later became famous as the original dixieland jazz band used to hang around and listen openmouthed to the music nat hentoff in a survey of race prejudice in jazz for harpers recalled that the new orleans negro trumpeter freddie keppard turned down an offer to record for rca victor in fearing that records would make his music easier to steal it was therefore only because of keppards reluctance that the white original dixieland jazz band happened to be the first to make records a year later on the other hand stearns says of ragtime originally a form of guitar and piano music that later merged into dixieland that it began in the midwest rather than new orleans and goes on to say that there were firstclass white as well as negro composers and performers history having thus passed into limbo undocumented and largely unobserved we can be certain now only that such prejazz forms as ragtime folkblues and minstrelsy sprang up in a firmly segregated society in my own book investigating jazz origins the book of jazz i observed that it was the segregated american negro not the negro who contributed most of its essential characteristics jazz was the product of a specific social environment in which a group of people the american negroes largely shut off from the white world developed cultural patterns of their own but if the bent note the plaintive flatted thirds and sevenths of the blues scale were drawn from the spiritual and the countryblues cries of the negro such perpetual components of jazz as the diatonic scale melodic structures and compositional patterns stemmed from white european sources the current theoreticians of the souljazz movementsoul here being an ingroup synonym for negro as in soulbrothertrace the jazz patrimony to the negro southern baptist churches yet many great jazzmen negro and white born in connecticut or new mexico michigan or ontario owe little or nothing musically to such a background nor can syncopated rhythms almost the trademark for jazz be ascribed to a single source the evidence points to an amalgam of influences from west africa cuba the west indies and various sections of the united states though it may not be clear where interracial crossfertilization began the separation of the races as a factor in forming jazz history can hardly be overestimated segregation shaped in negro musicians certain characteristics widely imitated by whites who could not undergo firsthand the experiences that provided the emotional basis for much of the negros music not only were negro and white musicians unable to work together publicly but until the late s with rare exceptions they did not even mingle in the recording studios the original dixieland jazz band was heard on records from on there was no regular recording of negro jazz until about five years later even riversides valuable history of classic jazz sdp offers no real evidence of pre negro jazz except for a couple of ragtime solos transcribed to piano rolls once in gadsden alabama the musicians union refused to let three white members of fletcher hendersons band play a date until they had applied burnt cork to their faces even today the american federation of musicians has segregated locals in chicago and many other cities louis armstrong an illustrious son of new orleans may never again play there because local law will not let him bring his mixed band because of such anomalies of american society the exchange of musical ideas between races was long confined to private meetings occasional sittingsin of white musicians with negro bands and vice versa and the radiothe last mainly a source of white jazz since whites had a nearmonopoly of the jobs with the best air time recordings were less influential than might be assumed the s by louis armstrong fletcher henderson bessie smith and others were branded as race records sold largely in negro neighborhoods and purchased by whites only when they visited these ghettos the broadcasting of records was a minor factor since there were no disc jockeys in the s and early s despite these obstacles an interchange did occur during the twenties and thirties armstrong earl hines coleman hawkins and fats waller reached and influenced thousands of young white musicians bix beiderbecke was a source of inspiration to negro trumpeters rex stewart used to play bixs famous singin the blues chorus note for note and frank trumbauers saxo ph one style impressed such youngsters as lester young and benny carter in benny goodman shattered the barrier by taking teddy wilson out on the road as a member of his trio but the taboos still prevented his incorporation into the bandhe was considered a separate added attraction slowly the public image of allwhite and allnegro groups changed but it was not until the late s that mixed combos and bands were common if the american jazzman was aware of the negros role in the music they shared the white public even many jazz fans had little knowledge of it a glance at the annual metronome poll in shows that guitarist charlie christian was the only negro winner in the eleven categories at a time when benny carter coleman hawkins jimmy blanton j c higginbotham roy eldridge and ella fitzgerald were at their peaks the winners in their respective categories were toots mondello tex beneke bob haggart tommy dorsey ziggy elman and helen oconnell negro musicians ideas tunes and arrangements were duplicated for fun and profit in dehydrated versions by whites as witness glenn millers bonanza with tuxedo junction borrowed from erskine hawkinss band in the midst of such surroundings some of todays angriest jazzmen the max roaches and charlie minguses who speak most loudly of racial injustice were growing to maturity and observing that the negro was getting less than his full creditand financial reward it is not hard to understand why crow jim the antiwhite feeling of the past few years and the second wrong that does not make a right arose as the product of decades of jim crow during the past twenty years there has been a sharp change in the attitude of the american public little by little negroes have gained majority status as jazz musicians while the tendency to equate jazz authenticity with dark skina trend that began some years ago in francehas become more widely established though ellington basie and gillespie have been using white musicians off and on for years the young white musician now finds it increasingly harder to gain acceptance among his negro contemporaries and among many negro and some white jazz fans there is a growing and highly vocal minority of negro musicians to whom the presence of a white man in a negroled band is galling several negro leaders and negro sidemen working for white bands have been asked why do you hire a white man when a negro is available or similarly why do you work for this ofay band and make it sound good stay with your own fortunately most jazzmen reject the notion that jazz is solely the province of the negro and agree that it is as wrong to exclude whites from jazz as to forbid negroes to play bach or stravinsky interracial cooperation has produced some of the most vital recorded jazz of our day miles davis and gil evans john lewis and gunther schuller dizzy gillespie and lalo schifrin sonny rollins and jim hall and so forth the primary influence upon ella fitzgerald was the radio voice of connee boswell and negro guitarist wes montgomery greatly admired django reinhardt a few years ago roy eldridge bet me he could distinguish white from negro musicians on records and the muchcited results of the blindfold test published in down beat demonstrated that there was no such thing as a negro style in jazz eldridge did not even get as many right answers as the law of averages entitled him to it is true of course that certain jazz styles are commonly associated with negro musicians for example the style of horace silver and other combos that record for blue note records is played almost exclusively by negroes similarly a certain saxophone style is nearly always identified with white musicians such as stan getz and zoot sims but there are exceptions in both cases the important point is that both have been created by social and aesthetic influences and have nothing to do with skin color one has only to observe the negroes of nonamerican origin as i did in my teens in england to pierce the illusion british negro jazzmen were and still are no more adept than their white colleagues at developing the feeling for the jazz beat that seems second nature to so many americans today in fact there is a wide range of musical approaches among negro jazzmen some such as john lewis deeply involved with orchestral developments are closer to european traditions than to the core of jazz while others like max roach more concerned with improvisations and rhythm are seeking kinship with their african ancestors and cousins still others dizzy gillespie for example draw the best from both camps and manage to combine pragmatic realism with a sense of humor despite the rapidly changing social climate and its effect on the world of music jazz will almost certainly continue to be an interracial art form a spirit of good will still prevails between most negro and white musicians despite the pressure from the disenchanted and the dissident these last are sure only of what they are against while the majority is sure of what it is for the right to work play and live together on equal terms jazzmen of the past especially those who fought stubbornly to mix their bands at a time when this was hazardous and financially risky have played a laudable part in helping to eliminate racial barriers those of the present and future no matter what some current skirmishes may seem to indicate will in my view carry forward the initiative of their precursors
what the black muslims believe by elijah muhammad this is the question asked most frequently by both the whites and the blacks the answers to this question shall state as simply as possible we want freedom we want a full and complete freedom we want justice equal justice under the law we want justice applied equally to all regardless of creed or class or color we want equality of opportunity we want equal membership in society with the best in civilized society we want our people in america whose parents or grandparents were descendants from slaves to be allowed to establish a separate state or territory of their owneither on this continent or elsewhere we believe that our former slave masters are obligated to provide such land and that the area must be fertile and minerally rich we believe that our former slave masters are obligated to maintain and supply our needs in this separate territory for the next to yearsuntil we are able to produce and supply our own needs since we cannot get along with them in peace and equality after giving them years of our sweat and blood and receiving in return some of the worst treatment human beings have ever experienced we believe our contributions to this land and the suffering forced upon us by white america justifies our demand for complete separation in a state or territory of our own we want freedom for all believers of islam now held in federal prisons we want freedom for all black men and women now under death sentence in innumerable prisons in the north as well as the south we want every black man and woman to have the freedom to accept or reject being separated from the slave masters children and establish a land of their own we know that the above plan for the solution of the black and white conflict is the best and only answer to the problem between two people we want an immediate end to the police brutality and mob attacks against the socalled negro throughout the united states we believe that the federal government should intercede to see that black men and women tried in white courts receive justice in accordance with the laws of the landor allow us to build a new nation for ourselves dedicated to justice freedom and liberty as long as we are not allowed to establish a state or territory of our own we demand not only equal justice under the laws of the united states but equal employment opportunitiesnow we do not believe that after years of free or nearly free labor sweat and blood which has helped america become rich and powerful that so many thousands of black people should have to subsist on relief charity or live in poor houses we want the government of the united states to exempt our people from all taxation as long as we are deprived of equal justice under the laws of the land we want equal educationbut separate schools up to for boys and for girls on the condition that the girls be sent to womens colleges and universities we want all black children educated taught and trained by their own teachers under such schooling system we believe we will make a better nation of people the united states government should provide free all necessary text books and equipment schools and college buildings the muslim teachers shall be left free to teach and train their people in the way of righteousness decency and self respect we believe that intermarriage or race mixing should be prohibited we want the religion of islam taught without hindrance or suppression these are some of the things that we the muslims want for our people in north america this material appeared originally in the black muslim journal muhammad speaks how to stamp out the dope racket by atty s carter mcmorris his writer is a member nps f of the legal profession i p and as such has had considerable experience in criminal trials and appeals i am also a member of society and i hope a publicspirited member there are those who would say that there is a conflict between the two positions that a criminal lawyer is necessarily at odds with the best welfare of society in that he uses every device at his command to preserve the freedom of alleged law violators w including dope pushers however one of the basic tenets of my philosophy is that society has only the criminals it deserves and that the function of the criminal lawyer is to protect from social persecution those unfortunate victims of our collective confusions whom we seek to make the scapegoats for the wrongs of alltoocriminal community much of the income of todays criminal lawyer is derived from defense of people accused of narcotics law violations yet i wish that this source of income were completely eliminated at this point my position as a member of society dominates that of defender of the accused the use of narcotics has such dire individual and social consequences that i fear for our general welfare unless something is done to curb it however in my opinion the proposals and approach of those people albeit wellmeaning who consider jail a panacea for all our social problems will only increase the dope peril this is true because the get tough approach will be no more effective in the case of narcotics than it was in the case of alcohol all too soon we seem to have forgotten the lessons of our prohibition blunder which led to repeal in short years during which the criminal world ran rampant in its pushing of illegal booze get tough legislation made possible the a capones and lucky lucianos of that era similar legislation in the narcotics field will necessarily result in the same sort of breakdown in fact has already done so to an extent not fully yet appreciated legislative fiat in connection with the narcotics problem like that perennially proposed by the womens christian temperance union for control of the beverage use of alcohol will prove a miserable failure because however desirable it may be theoretically it fails to take into account the realities of human nature in particular the weaknesses of human nature which lead to most of our problems personal or international in the first place the specific weaknesses which are at the root of the narcotics problem are ignorance and greed ignorance of the user who becomes a victim before he realizes the facts of addiction greed of the pusher who will risk anything because of the tremendous profits involved finally greed of the lawenforcement officer who often looks the other way when sufficient bribe is offered by the wellheeled men who run the illicit narcotics business such as the mafia or cosa nostra the get tough policy also fails to take into consideration the fact that detection on a large enough scale to get at the root of the problem is wellnigh impossible no matter how many skilled federal and state narcotics officers are retained at the expense of the taxpayers this is true because of the constitutional ruling that private premises and persons may not be invaded or searched by such officers unless they have a warrant or probable cause case after case has been dismissed against known and proven dope possessors or sellers because their constitutional rights were violated by the arrresting officers narcotics violations being necessarily of a private nature involving no protesting victim is especially susceptible to protection against police trespass of even greater pertinence and effect is a recent decision of the united states supreme court in a case appealed to it by this writer which holds that narcotics addicts must now be m treated not penalized for their condition this decision leaves open to the states at least three approaches to the addict they may simply leave him alone concentrating their efforts solely upon the dealers the real criminals albeit created and preserved by our asinine approach of the past which has failed to recognize the sociomedical as distinguished from criminal nature of addiction secondly the addict may be subjected to forced hospitalization confinement treatment this approach while consistent with the courts edict will have little or no effect on the overall problem because it will reach only those addicts who are caught since very few will voluntarily submit to compulsive treatment this leaves yet a third method which it is the purpose of this writing to explain and advocate and which is commonly known as the free clinic plan of narcotics legalization by legalization we mean not that dope may be supplied or administered by a street peddler corner grocer bartender or even druggist what is meant is that a person who is shown by appropriate tests to be an addict may be given sufficient quantities of the needed drug to make him comfortable unless he voluntarily submits to a cure perhaps under persuasion encouragement and education to the facts of addiction in which case such cure may be attempted in either event the drug may be supplied only by a duly licensed physician and administered under his guidance clinics should be established or enlarged so that the narcotics may be supplied at nominal cost or no cost at all because the prime consideration is to take the profits out of dope pushing it all adds up to a choice of the lesser of two evils in the first place i do not personally see dope use or government supply in free clinics as so much a moral issue as a question of individual and public health i do not think that the use of dope is basically any different from or more immoral than the use of alcohol or cigarettes nicotine itself being a narcotic the only reason why it does not kill off more people being that most of it goes up in smoke as contrasted with the mainline injection of heroin into the veins i do not think that anyone should use narcotics or tobacco or alcohol perhaps but i do not think the use can be stopped by force it is here that ignorance comes in and its counterpart education the only way to prevent the use of harmful substances privately when such substances supply an imagined need is mass education regarding the effects on health and longevity of such indulgence coupled with taking the profits out of the supply of the product involved there must be practical realistic reasons why people should or should not engage in any specific conduct which can be understood if properly presented and the reason why so many people do what they shouldnt is simply that wrong ideas are literally sold while proper conduct is not advanced because of lack of profits because of the secret private nature of dope use and sales the punishment approach only increases the problem as in the old saying that if you pluck out one gray hair two others will grow in its place when one narcotic addict is incarcerated one or more will take his place in the dope market recruited by the pusher or other addicts to be rejoined by the old one when he gets out of confinement thus increasing the problem by geometric progression treatment and free supply for addicts who can not or will not quit will while not curing those now addicted rare if not impossible in the present state of knowledge medical and otherwise prevent the recruiting or spread of this vicious habit because of the billions of dollars in profits annually use of narcotics does not lead naturally or directly to crime users are forced into crime because they cannot get a free or cheap supply of the substances that they feel they must have or suffer even die they will do anything to get such supply preferring nonviolent crimes if possible so that arrest will be less likely at the same time those who control the supply can charge exorbitant rates because of the tremendous compulsion of dope use an artificial but insistent hunger as compelling as the appetite for food or sex finally lawenforcement officers by choice or chance will concentrate on arresting masses of little pushers usually with only enough activity to keep up their own habit while accepting graft and bribes from the really big narcotics dealers in those rare instances when such are caught as senator daniel points out an arrested smuggler or peddler hardly misses the few thousand dollar bills he puts up for bail bond and his fine how much more willingly will he pay the same amount or even more for police protection in short enforcement will not work because no one will try to make it work and because only a small part of the traffic can be detected the user will not voluntarily surrender to enforced punishment or treatment the pusher will risk anything short of death perhaps even death for the immense return on his investment the policeman will in significant instances fail to enforce the law because of his own greed his desire to share in the profits of dope addiction coupled and justified in his mind by his own recognition of the futility of the present methods thus the get tough policy will not work there is no real alternative therefore to the free clinic plan addicts will cooperate if they are treated humanely and if they can participate voluntarily rather than by compulsion they will prefer safe medical treatment to the risk of death by overdose in the hands of the underworld many of them will be able to hold jobs now impossible for them since as much as a day may be required for an extreme habit so that all their time must be spent in attempting to acquire big money quickly through prostitution burglary shoplifting and dope pushing on their own in the main under the medicalpsychiatric treatment approach a few may find it possible to quit the habit though it seems to me that we are missing the boat if we emphasize curing those now addicted in the present state of medical knowledge of the problem the important thing is to prevent the recruiting of other addicts to nip the traffic in the bud finally with addicts getting the injections they need or want in clinics not to take out to give or sell to others but in injections scientifically prepared to last for say a day or longer there will be no incentive for pushers to seek new victims who will only turn to the clinics if they become addicted no one wants to make another an addict simply to see him use dope profit is involved in every case consciously or unconsciously a man may lead his wife or girl friend to the needle and turn her to prostitution because he cannot make enough otherwise to support his own habit for example not because he wants her to share his misery mass education in school by press radio and television will take the ignorance out of the dope problem the free clinic plan will take the profits out this realistic approach can and will work and it is the only thing that will work in the present imperfect state of human evolution as a criminal lawyer i would like to be one of the first to sacrifice that portion of my income attributable indirectly to the narcotics traffic on the altar of human betterment unless these steps are taken at once i fear such a spread of this vicious social sickness as indicated by the dire prediction of one of my clients we had better prepare for a pushbutton war if war comes again there will not be enough health and vigor left in our youth to fight any other kind negro ministers have not failed have sociologists by rev charles h king jr rapierlike thrust of t j dr hares sociologit cal insights into the bocy o the nes ro ministry have negro ministers failed their roles left most of us bleeding and bewildered midway through his article i was tempted to throw off my passion for presiding and seek the comfortable confines of black muslimdom where he reports per cent of my brethren have already found solitude where did dr hare obtain his axe his admission that he is the son of a baptist minister causes further concern how long has this talented young man ignored the couch of analysis at the expense of maintaining his sublimated hostilities surely the deep seated frustration toward the negro church and its ministry must have stunted both his respect for propriety and his training as a sociologist as a former pugilist his ungloved fists struck the negro church in the solar plexis its ministry i have read with great care and appreciation the other articles by dr hare printed in negro digest these articles revealed a great talent for analytical insights into the problems of a rapidly changing society some showed the unmistakable stroke of genius now for dr hare to take to task the spiritual leaders of the christian church to me is a prostitution of his acknowledged abilities the problem of understanding the role of the minister is not his alone a surprisingly large number of laymen have too long looked into the pulpit for the symbol of the religionist consequently minimizing their own role as stewards of the christian faith elton trueblood in his book alternative to futility correctly identifies this phenonemon we confuse the notion of being professionally pastoral with the notion of being professionally religious this widespread notion of a man of the cloth a variant of the primitive notion of medicine man is wholly pernicious by making religion as a profession rather than a vocation the ordinary member is relieved of a sense of urgent responsibility and becomes a spectator when he ought to be a participator in short if ministers have failed in their role it is as a consequence of the attendant failure within the pews however the rebuttal is not based on this premise first of all the minister does not hide behind the pious shield of infallibility god forbid the negro church is not rome neither does its ministry claim popeship such a shield if presented would justifiably serve as the instrument to unfrock us as all of us are bathed in the waters of human frailty again back to the pews we do not entirely blame backsliders elijah muhammad and the bowling alley for the drastic decline in negro attendance but some of the blame must be shared by those like dr hare who view the church with critical eyes while possessing supurb intellectsand idle hands these are the ones who refuse to share the responsibility of the stewardship of their talents to assist the church with its multitudinous problems he then bemoans the passing of the shepherd pastor what does he suggestthat the church of is the church of his childhood either he is being naive or he fails to employ the interpretive science of his calling it would be the height of folly for me to interpret the changes of the social order just as it was folly for dr hare to correctly gauge the changes of the religious order however since war has been declared i shall risk the front lines with his own weapons charles s johnson in his book the shadow of the plantation stated the church is the one outstanding institution in the community over which the negroes themselves exercise control it offers the only medium for community feeling this is a correct definition and it fits well into the retarded age into which the eminent sociologist would retire but this definition of the negro church was made in a close look at the negro church today defies such a definition the year that he cries out for the return of the shepherd pastor is the same year that the sheep have outgrown their pasture and are now grazing in the total environment of a rapidly integrated society what shepherd can bloom with these sheep indeed it is fortunate that he has time to shake their hand as they leave the church for the complexities of living has become their fold and the shepherd does well to even glimpse their fleeing forms the shepherd pastor has been relegated to the task of an administratorexecutive and the minister who fails to exercise administrative tasks is in severe straits he will soon find himself in a maze of embellishments that would either drive him to the couch of a psychiatrist or to the campus of howard university there he could observe dr hare and write an article for negro digest entitled have negro sociologists failed their roles to say that dr hares article is without some merit would be absurd we share his chagrin at the deplorable spectacle of our embattled conventions the squabbles church splits and struggles for power however these are exceptions and extraordinary exceptions at that the overwhelming majority of churches and ministers are far removed from the chaotic picture that he paints concerning the days that he deplores nothing would please the minister more than to eliminate these days from the church womens day mens day etc have two reasons for perpetuation the first is that those who are able to support the church disgrace it with their pittances secondly the vast majority of negro church membership constitutes those who suffer deprivation and are on the bottom rung of the economic totem pole suffice it to say the church where dr hare probably attends was built in the past by the welcome coins from days dr hare can illafford to criticise the ministers in the freedom struggle if ministers have used their special position in the negro struggle due to their freedom from white economic pressure and their access to a more or less permanent multitude of ready made followers god bless them and more power to them if the jails could speak they would tell the story of its inhabitants they would declare that their cells contained in virtually every southern state the sons the daughters of the church and the black prophets who led them there the publicity received is a mere byproduct of the cause and in many instances a most necessary byproduct for if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound who shall respond to battle remove from the struggle for freedom the names of martin_luther_king wyatt t walker fred shuttlesworth ralph abernathy kelly miller smith gardner taylor father gibson and other ministers known and unknown and what do you have more is involved here than a passion for presiding and the search for publicity rather let us believe it is a passion for freedom and a search for justice whether these men ride south as freedom riders or sitdown in their own backyards in mississippi it is bringing about a change in the conditions of a disenfranchised race recently in a conversation with rev edward j odom church secretary for the naacp he told me that of the churches he visited this year the backbone of the entire negro revolt was the negro church and its minister he said take away the negro preacher and the church and the movement will lose its fervor and religious motivation this blow struck by dr hare must be classified as one that hit below the belt without question this round of criticism must be taken away from him the men of god yell foul let this be well known dr j h jackson president of the national baptist convention and millionaire s b fuller are not the images of todays ministers the vast majority of negro ministers cannot afford to drive big cars take trips to russia or fly to make addresses the balance of their time is devoted to picketing confronting the white power structure in behalf of their people visiting the sick burying the dead and agonizing over impossible budgets and then of course preaching the gospel even this dr hare takes to task he would have the negro minister devote his time to considering the horrors of war and speaking out against the massive murder of modern warfare yes it is true we do have lockjaw on this subject an introspective view of war reveals that it is as a consequence of sin in high places what need of battering at the walls of war to a people who possess neither the power nor the instruments to wage warfare why preach the evils of war even to white christiandom when they fail to hear the basic message of love thy neighbor why spend time on advocating global disarmament while rocks are in the hands of white supremacist why argue for a peace treaty with russia while negroes have no communication with the white communities of birmingham and albany ga dr hares remarks on the war records of ministers were so juvenile that to frame a rebuttal would be futile and who might i ask living or dead black or white has added to the wisdom of moses solomon and job if it is true that the negro minister has failed in his role and that church members are flocking en masse to black muslims then his article has abetted such movement incidentally dr hare has a continuous theme of attributing to the muslims qualities that should be possessed by christiandom what are those qualities dare he suggest that morality includes hate indeed the tenor of his speech suggests he is closely aligned with their doctrine if this is so and i know it is not then let him cease from his caustic comparisons and flee to join their ranks the corporeal sin committed by his article was that he failed to utilize his training as a social scientist it was obvious that most of his arguments were hampered by the loud emotional overtones of personal frustration as such he created a stereotype that a mere glance in his undergraduate notebook would have destroyed it is this there are more differences within a group than there are between groups he weakly tries to cover for this sociological error by stating that there are exceptions thank you doctor he adds but exceptions are no refutations of the general condition for shame if the picture that he painted is generally the one of the church and its ministry then i agree with him god help us all for we are men most miserable and not even sidling up to the lawd for reprieve will satisfy our quest for refuge but one escape remains if the leak in the ark of the church is as destructive as outlined by dr hare let us all disembark for our spiritual lives perhaps the muslims will provide us a lifeboatwithout oars race and big business by jackie robinson any american businessmen feel threatened by the current fastspreading negro revolution they have read the page one news of the demonstrations boycotts selective buying campaigns picketing drives and economic withdrawal programs they know that entire communities like birmingham have been thrown into chaos because there is a new militant negro in the land industry knows that this negro is aware that he is million strong and has billion to spend annually the financial newspapers and magazines the confidential business reports and trade publications reveal that a number of important corporations have recently changed employment patterns the american businessman particularly in metropolitan markets with substantial nonwhite populations wonders nervously where the next offensive will be mounted in my opinion both as a negro passionately concerned about civil_rights and as a business executive deeply interested in the health of our economy this threat to the business community can be transformed from a negative into a positive this damocleslike sword can be refashioned into a plowshare which can help to bring a rich harvest of opportunity to american businessmen who are enlightened and progressive enough to lead i do not believe the american businessman up until this time has demonstrated the kind of leadership regarding this domestic crisis which he owes to his own enterprise and to his nations economy by and large he has emphasized the negative he has fear and apprehension he views with alarm the new aggression of marching negroes i suggest that the time has come to go forward with all the courage persuasion and determination with which in the past he has helped make this country a frontrunner in world commerce if the american businessman takes this initiative it is my belief that he will be able to work out a treatya practical working relationship between negroes and whiteswhich can insure our eco nomy not only peace but justice on the racial front it was the business leadership of birmingham which under the most unfavorable and tense conditions found the way to make peace with those who were spearheading the negro protest it was not the state government the city government the religious or civic leaders who moved to bring a halt to the dangerous and seemingly hopeless stalemate between what negroes wanted and what antiintegrationists and governor wallace wanted them to have it was i repeat business leadership this happened i must emphasize in a city which has been called the worst city in terms of race relations it happened at the height of crisis in an atmosphere a few hot breaths removed from lynching during one of the most crucial meetings between the businessmen and negro leaders of birmingham youngsters were on the march in the streets outside yet a pact was made between reasonable men how much easier and more sensible it would be to resolve our racial problems before demonstrations occur before the picketing before violence erupts before we have been backed into corners and have no other alternative than to try to find reason in an atmosphere of emotion and anger why wait until your community or your business is in the throes of boycott why put aside even for another moment recognition of the undeniable justice of the aspirations of the negro to be accepted into the mainstream of our society economic and otherwise for even if that recognition does not come in your own mind it is inevitably coming in the laws and mores of our society even those who vigorously deny the negros right to equality know that they are projecting a doomed philosophy the most rigid segregationists today are no longer shouting never if they are you can believe that in their hearts they mean not just yetlater they are fighting a holding action seeking to delay full integration i make this appeal through sales management to the nations sales executives because i know that the acumen of this countrys captains of commerce and industry has been one of the major factors in our attainment of superiority in world commerce i know that american leaders have brilliantly anticipated future trends upon which to base present decisions i cannot understand why with all this talent and perception the heads of our great corporations and enterprises have not moved with positiveness to meet the great potentials in the current racial situation they love america as i love america can it be that they have been fooled into believing that the negro revolution is unamerican if this be true then they have forgotten that we would not be here as america had it not been for another revolution which sought vindication of justice and the dignity of the human personality the moderate leaders of the negro revolutionroy wilkins dr martin_luther_king jr whitney young a philip randolph james farmerseek for the negro today only what america promised all of its citizens yesterday and that is the reason they are unwilling to wait until tomorrow howtodaycan the american businessman move positively to meet the challenge of this revolution to strengthen american economy and to enter into an exciting competition for the billion negro market here are some suggestions throw open the doors to the negro on an equal basis do this not only because it is fair that he should have his share in our economy but also because he has a contribution of talent and loyalty to offer to your enterprise do it also because you will demonstrate to the negro consumer that you want his business a friend of ours a new york city industrial relations man has perceptively described the negro market as an invitational market open the doors of job opportunity to colored people and not only will they come in as valuable employees but you will find you have won the consumer loyalty of the negro how will you find qualified competent negroes in virtually every metropolitan city there is a branch of the national urban league for years this organization guided and aided not only by top negro social scientists but also by enlightened white businessmen and philanthropists has been working in the area of expanding employment opportunities for the negro the urban league is not an employment agency but it stands ready and willing to help supply negro personnel particularly in breakthrough situations or special job categories which have not been available to negroes in the past there are other ways by which negro employees can be found advertise in the negro newspapers you dont have to make any special appeal in these ads negro applicants will know they are welcome when they see your advertisement in their press communicate with high schools colleges and universities contact civic organizations which are working in the field of race relations let it be known among the negro clergy that your doors are open for qualified people the negro clergy has been in the forefront of the struggle for jobs along with the naacp and other groups so by contacting the churches you are going right to the source from which the anti demonstrations have been coming you are turning a negative into a positive you are advertising not only your intentions to give jobs but your interest in the market the masses of the negro people are churchbased for years business people have said i would hire negroes but it would destroy the morale of my present employees they would refuse to work with negroes hogwash in many cases heads of businesses have utilized this argument as a device to camouflage their own prejudices in many other cases there has been a genuine fear of resentment by white employees it is my belief that the vast majority of whites will not leave good decent job situations because negroes are brought in to work by their side the key to acceptance of negroes by white employees is the firmness of the boss to be a good businessman one has to be a good leader vacillate and the battle will be lost the chairman of the board of chock full onuts william black the man who hired me as a vice president when i left baseball is one businessman who didnt vacillate years before i joined the company at the very outset of setting it up mr black decided he would hire any qualified person regardless of race or color he made this decision because he felt it was the right thing to do and he has continued the policy over the years not only have we maintained a tremendous amount of support from whites we have also over the years before my coming to the company and after enjoyed a tremendous amount of loyalty and support from negroes this is true not alone because of my relationship with the company but also because the negro public knows that the negro can work at chock its a bit embarrassing to say what i am about to say but it makes my point and i cant help being human enough to be proud of it ive been told in some of the stores in harlem where our coffee is sold that some people ask not for chock full o nuts coffee but for that jackie robinson coffee this isnt so much a personal tribute to me as it is indicative of the hunger which the negro has for identification his desire to be a part of what is really going on in our country his pride when one of his own gets recognition and his loyalty to those who give it as i pointed out above the policy of our company allows not only for hiring without discrimination but for hiring people regardless of race on all levels and upgrading those who are deserving one of the serious problems the negro faces today is that some companies which will hire him without qualms will not allow him to advance to whatever position his ability might actually entitle him to the enterprising young negro today wants not only a paycheck but a potential if he has within himself the ability to advance in his company he does not want to believe he will be allowed to go just so far and no further it must be discouraging to him to make a study of topechelon corporations in america and find how few important jobs are held by negroes to my knowledge there are only three negro vice presidents in their executive ranks the two other negroes besides myself who hold vice presidencies in large companies are george olden the brilliant senior art director at mccannerickson and harvey russell who has done a splendid job with pepsicola when chock named me a vice president a friend of mine who is in public relations told me that my appointment marked the first time to his knowledge that the name and picture of a negro had appeared in the financial pages of the new york times when these youngsters realize that their race spends billions of dollars in america and that thousands of talented young negroes are graduating from colleges and universities yearly it must seem that progress in the placement of executive and managerial personnel is snaillike as to white employees and executives respecting authority given to a negro i have had no trouble in this regard one of the reasons is that when i was named to my job it was made very clear to everyone by our board chairman william black who was president and samuel ostrove who is now president that i had full unquestioned authority over personnel when i first joined chock i did not want to believe i was being taken on simply because my career in baseball had made me a well known person i would not be able to stomach being used as a puppet with someone else pulling the strings i want to work for my money and to be respected and respect others mr black straightened out my apprehensions immediately making me realize that my appointment was not just one of those spectacular moves to capitalize on publicity the longer you are with this company the better off well all be he told me personnel is your job and i want you to do it i said above that i know of only three vice presidents with top companies i do not know of some smaller companies that have tried to win the negro market by taking on some popular negro and giving him a highsounding title with no authority and often no compensation equivalent to the supposed stature of the job this is tokenism these days negroes are becoming more and more alert to the tokenist approach in politics as well as in business if you hire negroesand you shouldmake them aware of the fact that they can advance as high as their ability and the companys table of organization can take them when you promote them to a position of authority pay them what the job commands and let everyone realize that they have real responsibility it is then up to them to produce and if they dont they deserve no special consideration because they are negroes get rid of them just as fast as you would anyone elsebut not faster demonstrating to the negro not only that your door is open but also that he can climb the stairway of career advancement will bring you people of high caliber who might otherwise seek opportunity elsewhere i have heard complaints from heads of business who say look i want to hire negroes but i cant get any to apply i had a negro applicant the other day who came in for a job when i asked him what he wanted to do he was looking for a janitors job and you know what he had a college education tragically this does happen one of the reasons is that for so long regardless of qualifications and background the negro has been led to believe that only the menial positions are open to him so often he doesnt even bother to try nor is he willing to settle for the lowest type of work there are thousands and thousands of young negroes who would go into companies which to their knowledge had a training program and a fair promotion system they would be willing to start in minor jobs and work at trainee salaries if they had the confidence that there was somewhere to go undoubtedly there are many companies where such conditions exist but negroes dont know it there ought to be some kind of link between these wellintentioned firms and the negro public one solution to this is the hiring of a top negro personnel executive or public relations man or retraining a negro who has intelligence integrity and a balanced understanding of the problems both of the negro and of the white employer who wants to integrate beware however of the adviser there are people like this in every racewho wants to give you only the kind of advice he thinks will please you you are much better off doing business with someone who tells you what he thinks you ought to know rather than what he feels you might want to hear there are two other developments in the nature of the new militant negro he wants to look forward to becoming a race of producers as well as consumers and he wants identification with products on which he is spending his money i have been made very much aware of the interest of the negro in his own economic stabilization within our society recently when the new york times carried a story that i was associated with a group which was seeking a charter to establish a bank in harlem i received many inquiries from negroes who wanted to invest to buy stock or who just wanted to say that this is the kind of thing our people should be doing developing and creating more enterprises of our own although i feel that in the establishment of major business enterprises the negro ought to take initiative and corral group support white businessmen bankers and financiers can help negro entrepre neurs by lending a hand both in counseling and financially as to the negros desire for identification the question has been asked of me whether i thought negroes want negro salesmen calling upon them representing companies and products while i do not feel that negro salesmen ought to be confined only to negro neighborhoods i do believe that representation of companies by negroes appeals to the negro consumer we observed in harlem not long ago a conflict between negro liquor salesmen and the liquor companies and distributors harlem is one of the most lucrative markets for retail liquor sales the community rallied behind negro salesmen who were denied assignments within their own community apparently because earnings within that community were much larger than in certain other areas here we had an example of the negro being denied opportunities created by the money spent by his own people right in his own backyard the sales field is one which offers so much potential to ambitious energetic people the negro wants in on it and negro consumers have begun to question why there cannot be more negro representation in this area this is one form of identification another is in advertising recently the new york telephone co ran a series of ads in which a modestly dressed averageappearing negro was standing in a street phone booth making a call it was an unsensationally executed brilliant coup for this ad received tremendous attention and i am sure did a splendid public relations job in the minds of many negro people who after all do use telephones too another development which caused much conversation was a recent issue of the new york times which carried several pictures of fashion models one of them was an attractive negro girl this was the first time many of us had seen a negro fashion model in a metropolitan daily i am sure no sensible whites were insulted i am certain many negroes felt a glow and i am willing to wager that this innovation did the manufacturer of the clothes the girl was wearing no harm it makes us feel good to realize america is beginning to realize that we are here that we contribute to the economy a friend of mine told me the other day that he had opened an account at a new york bank he had picked that bank because it has had several television commercials featuring diahann carroll the lovely negro actress the success won by companies which give the negro a sense of identification by using negro models can be measured when one leafs through one of americas finest publications ebony magazine john h johnson ebonys publisher was a pioneer in proving to manufacturers that the negro wanted a feeling of affiliation with their products and that one way to accomplish this was to utilize negro models ebonys million annual advertising volume substantiates the argument to date most companies and advertising agencies are fearful of running the same kind of advertisment that appears in ebony in magazines like life i am hopeful that we are going to wake up some morning soon and pick up our socalled white publications and see a crowd picture with negroes in it or a sandlot ball team which is not lily white i believe some forwardlooking businessmen are going to stop trying to keep it a secret that we are here and that we also spend yankee dollars and i dont believe there will be another civil war or white boycott if a cigarette company runs a back page ad featuring duke ellington smoking a cigarette i know there are attitudes which have existed for years i know there are problems which will not be solved simply i also know there is a tremendous challenge and a tremendous task ahead for americas business community answering the challenge will take imagination and boldness the reward can be more business for you from the billion market and a sense of having done a good thing for america by p a bullins whats hap ittl pening have you ljl made the scene yet t what f scene like man aint

from the governor and the mayor and showed them to me her happiness seemed so pathetic so wanting of something which is essential to happinessbelief that i felt sorry for her imagine she said hugging me effusively the governor and the mayor wrote me me thats a fine action on the part of the governor and the mayor i told her handing back the standard informal letters which bore the signatures of the two officials stamped by anonymous clerks well you can stay here for the rest of your life now i told her she turned on me as though i had cursed her who me not me and these people i can never be an american but you have citizenship now that doesnt mean anything citizenship doesnt mean much to her she says in an effort to cover up what really means so much to her a woman past here in the usa for five years she doesnt want to be considered an american negro as a matter of fact shes ashamed of being an american negro and this is the standard neurosis of the average west indian immigrant he or she does not want to be considered an american negro subconsciously they believe that the white man prefers them as nonamerican negroes in short he wishes to be the white mans favorite nigger and he may well be happy because he seems to be succeeding in dehumanizing himself this is the color complex of the west indian negro one who doesnt understand the fight for freedom in america one who doesnt wish to understand it and one who even understanding it doesnt have any sympathy for it its a further chapter in the history of the international black mans effort to escape from his skin and his being i have yet to meet a west indian negro who doesnt feel he is better than the american negro and therefore equal to the american white with whom he wishes to associate not everybody born in the west indies can be a sydney poitier or a cleveland robinson two of the many west indians who have entered the mainstream of american life the majority whether they come from jamaica trinidad barbados or grenada or any other part of the caribbean seek to degrade the american negro somebody once said that the immigrant was a mad dog in search of any bone and every time he found a bone he would cross a bridge look down in the water see a larger bone drop his own and run down the bank of the river to be deceived by his unquenchability well the immigrant negro in america seems to be the mad dog with a bone in his mouthconstantly dropping it and finding othersthroughout this long search for an identity sometime ago i met a jamaican in a greenwich village bar i asked him whether he had become an american citizen no and never soon he was lashing out at the defects of the american negro and pretending to be holierthanthey in the castle of his unpopular skin they are animals he said they are this and they are that i challenged his statements oh you wouldnt know he parried you have to work with them he works with themwith some civil_rights organization in new york this young man is about years old he came here three years ago to study engineering now he works parttime with this civil_rights organization but what can he do in the interest of civil_rights buried down as he is with such prejudices back in jamaica his father is an executive member of some branch of the government his uncle is an internationally respected writer and in his island home hes a prince in a shoe and nobody dares call him nigger or any name to the effect but here in new york or any other part of the united states he struggles hes a black man a negro so in order to retain an identity which can set him apart from what he considers the irresponsible mob he stays in his caribbean closet im from jamaica he says when you meet him but he doesnt even have to say it the exact preservation of his accent will warn you however that still wont be enough to show you how much hes not a part of the american dilemma he will criticize american negroes even going so far as to openly call them niggers and as soon as his studies are finished he intends to return to his island home and become a small bureaucrat he is not unlike my aunt and the thousands of other aunts there are my aunt rents a room from a trinidadiana woman who is an american citizen a woman who has children born in america but a woman who would never stand to be called an american because once you make her an american you make her an american negro this woman spends her time thinking so many things of the american negro that in attempting to be such a generous thinker she generally manages to outsay those whites who think the worst of any negro they have no morals she says because they drink beer out of cans they dont know how to rear their children they are lazy and without ambition we came here she said meaning the thousands of west indians in the states and in so little time we have educated our children and bought so many apartment houses here in new york but they the american negroes talk of the south why dont they leave the south and come here you tell me i told her that hundreds of negroes leave the south every week in search of a better life but to no avail my words falling on deaf ears she will not rent her rooms to an american negro without the recommendation of someone she respects years ago she sent her daughter to a predominantly white school and the child was accepted as an american negro which she in fact was when she discovered that she branded the child to the childs protests by putting gold bracelets on her wristsbracelets being then a mark of west indianism i was talking to another woman she has two children one at vassar and the other at dartmouth we were discussing the negro childs search for an identity in america oh she said proudly my children never had those problems you know their father and i were born in the west indies immediately she seeks to unmake their americanhood she tells me not to think of them in the context of the average boy or girl because their parents are from the caribbean its the same with almost every west indian parent in the states the majority of them believe that the british system of education is much better than the american and some of them translate their belief by sending their children to study in the islands or in england one of their standard complaints is that the american child who doesnt have the good luck to grow up in the home of west indian parents ends up being badly behaved and ambitionless children in america they say are badly behaved not like kids in the west indies kids who never say no kids who are completely dependent on their parents even while in their twenties they like this type of spineless child but not the fastmoving american child in this tense and unfaithful society they believe that the american negro is ambitionless and uneducated and they maintain this belief even in the face of strong proof of the contrary because its part of the chain of beliefs which helps them to pass their days in another country a crutch to lessen their insecurity they want to see the unfavorable so they see it i have never been segregated says one who has spent years in the white mans kitchen cleaning his floors and suffering humiliations and i dont see why there should be so many demonstrations and so much unrest i know white people and theyre not so bad she is serious yes i tell her i know that you know the white man but you know him too well so well that you have forgotten yourself but im a fool she doesnt listen and i realize she will die believing the same thing so may god bless her in the west indies everyone jostles for the chance to come to america everyone its the extensive gold mine waiting for intrepid diggers and those who come here are generally teachers civil servants nurses skilled persons and students they come because they want a better life they come to study or they come to work usually they do both but there are also those who do nothing they come out of a society where to be black is a disadvantage once here they start working some of them get good jobs others work as porters waiters etc but regardless of what they are doing they send exaggerated reports of comfort to their island homes while they suffer what they accept as temporary indignities the porter seldom identifies himself with the successes or failures of the american negro since he cant get a better job he offsets the temporary indignity by joining societies and lodges and becoming a leading member one thing he always says he is much better off in the west indies he may return to live there after some years away but usually he stays here on his very tenuous montage thinking that the fact that he came to america as an immigrant and not as a slave makes him so different from the negroes whose forefathers were brought here in chains years ago there is no valid reason for tms hysteria and false pride the fact that the american negro may have laughed at the african or west indian several years ago is no justification for sniping for the sake of enhancing ones position in nomansland we play into the hands of those who hate us most whenever we naively seek to dish out the same medicine which we have been swallowing for so many centuries yet the tragic part of all this is the fact that we are all guilty in some way or the other of this very subtle crime my aunt is a victim of this society which seeks to put man in different cells of his imagination and milk his essencewhat little he has left of it to divide him and then rule him and when she tells me she is better than an american negro i tell her that what you are is always your constant companion and you can only run so far that when we amputate one leg to improve our gait we stumble and fall in the dust of our souls prices are high prejudice is low so far by julia gaines mighty a colored american living in anchorage alaska you would be living high on the totem pole racerelationswise alaska has some of a if the best antidiscrimination laws in existence and the proper machinery to carry them out despite the necessity of having to oil the machinery occasionally the colored citizens agree that the basic parts are sound as a colored cheechako arriving here cheechako means newcomer the amiable race relations are only one of the many surprises that await you if you expect to flounder in snow over your head gape at slanteyed eskimos on dogsleds yelling mush and live in claustrophobic igloosyoull be let down or up as the case may be with a bang at first glance anchorage looks like many of the towns in the south which is what alaskans call the rest of the united states with the snow leveled down by the huge snowplows almost before it stops falling you would have to jump into a snowbank to get it past your knees youd probably gape at slanteyed short stockylooking people passing by but you would be confused they wear plain shirts pants sweaters skirts etc and they may be japanese chinese indian filipino or just possibly eskimo anchorage has all these groups you would be surrounded by apartment houses splitlevels ranchtypes bungalows etc if you didnt look sharp you might be run down by a sports car a cadillac or a chevy but on second glance you would see visual evidence of many of the things youve read and heard about alaska sprinkled immodestly among the modern buildings are log cabins and shacks left over from the riproaring frontier days among the passing throng are many fiercelooking men with long hair and beards wearing roughlooking apparel and looking like characters from a jack london novel there are modern stores advertising supplies to pan for gold and food lockers to store the moose and caribou shot in the outlying areas around the town later you might try to classify anchorage the closest and most confusing description ive heard it called is a cosmopolitan big country town it has all the evils of the big city though in smaller quantities and all the warmth and simplicity of the little town the town largest in alaska and founded in as a construction camp for the alaska railroad sits on a bluff bordered on the east by the chugach mountain and on the west and north by cook inlet and the susitna valley the howling blizzards and subsubzero temperatures normally associated with alaska pay very irregular visits to anchorage many cheechakos spend considerable sums buying the beautiful fur parkas that you see the eskimos wearing on the picture postcards but in reality the same type of winter clothing worn in the northern great lakes region can be worn here with comfort average temperature for january is degrees below zero and for july degrees fahrenheit but to the uninitiated the most startling thing about the climate is the lack of daylight in winter and the lack of night in summer in the middle of winter there is as little as five and a half hours of daylight and most cheechakos find their first winter here very depressing however summer really takes the cake for eccentricity at oclock at night the sun is still shining bright enough to make little cheechako children believe theyre being tricked when theyre told its way past their bedtime but really frightening are the occasional earthquakes mild since ive been here that keep you posted as to just how insignificant man really is the estimated population is census with negroes within this general figure however this figure does not include negroes and others who may live outside the city proper the pioneer settlers of this town naturally were the rough and rugged individualists the goldseekers the furtrappers the law dodgers the prostitutes and adventurers but in later years a more stable group began arriving the farmers the constructionists homesteaders employees of the federal government and the professionals the present population consists of all these groups if you listened closely to the accents of the white and colored people on the streets in the schools in fact all around you you would notice that the far western and the slow southern drawls predominate if youre the type of colored cheechako steeped in the notion that all the white boogiemen and all the backward slowmoving negroes are from the deep south and the far west you would be doubly confused here although both groups predominantly speak that way there is something about their general bearing that implies friendliness and respect toward each other and strangers as well almost everyone is relatively new and they seem to have been too busy getting their feet on solid ground to resent the man beside them there is a general atmosphere of informality of trying to get ahead and of exciting things about to happen however generally speaking there is a lack of qualified leadership a recent editorial in the anchorage times said in speaking of alaska in general the two greatest problems wanting solution today are leadership and investment capital speaking of anchorage and the negro in particular there are no negro leaders as such although there are several outstanding negroes in the community when i asked several supposedly wellinformed negroes about this alleged lack of leadership one man commented there are a lot of would be leaders here yes we have great quantity but little quality this was the comment made most often on the other hand one woman said that since the colored folks are able to take a small or large part in almost everything here there hasnt been any necessity for a strong negro leader although there hasnt been enough racial dissension in anchorage to foster a martin_luther_kingtype leader the existence of a local naacp has certainly come in handy to say the least it was organized in and in spite of persistent internal bickering and external tongueclackings it has proven its worth to the community three of the bills sponsored by it and subsequently passed by the legislature benefit not only the negro but other minority groups as well they are fepcbill antidiscrimination bill in housing and human rights bill in august of the naacp sponsored a picketing of carrs a local supermarket because of its hiring practices within two months negroes were hired the anchorage naacp also participates in activities including negroes outside of alaska in june of this year a memorial service was held in memory of medgar evers the naacp leader killed in jackson miss a total of was raised at the services to send to mrs evers and her children senator ernst gruening dalaska sent a wire to the services indicating his complete accord with the actions of the naacp through consultations and meetings with housing authorities the naacp helped to open balky doors to several apartment houses for prospective negro tenants however housing discrimination is still the biggest whirlpool in a relative sea of calm because it is accomplished by subtle practices that defy pinpoint identification consciously or unconsciously the leading anchorage newspaper helps by printing ads from time to time of apartments or houses for rent for white only and for colored only if you were a cheechako colored or white looking for a job here and had no particular skill or training you might curse the day you arrived the population has grownand is still growingso rapidly that even the people already here face difficulties in gaining yearround employment especially those who do construction work or other jobs dependent more or less on construction work with the advent of so many people a permanent labor supply is already here at present it varies from during the peak summer months down to in winter so many people have come to anchorage expecting to find their fortunes and have been disillusioned until the anchorage chamber of commerce says in its informational tract on anchorage we strongly recommend that those in search of employment do not venture north without employment assured or have sufficient funds to draw upon until employment is secured at least per person plus return fare if job hunt is unsuccessful and we strongly recommend that those interested in business opportunities plan to take a trip and look the situation over firsthand for all groups living costs are high from december of throughout a friend of mine rented a threebedroom apartment bedrooms like closets for a month plus an average monthly utility bill plus an average a month for the coinoperated washer and dryer setup in the apartment basement no washing machines allowed in her apartment as you can see this comes to and food clothing medical expenses and recreation havent been mentioned if you wanted to buy a home in anchorage you would pay between three to five thousand more than you would pay for a home of similar build in new york for instance quite a few prefabricated houses are shipped here and sold and many people live in trailers because much of the food and other merchandise are imported these prices are high also however i must add that wages are quite high and buying from the large supermarkets chain department stores cutrate drugstores and discount houses helps to balance the increased living expenses even so if youre out of a job you can see that things might be a mite difficult there are no set figures but it is estimated that at least per cent of anchorage negroes work in construction and service jobs in addition to this many negroes work for the city state and federal government in fact the economy of anchorage is primarily dependent upon the government and the military you can hear quite often from disgruntled citizens if they take elmendorf air force base and fort rich away this town would go to the dogs there is more than a grain of truth in this statement but anchorage does have other economic activities going on anchorage is headquarters for the alaska railroad chief center for air transportation in alaska chief center of oil exploration products activities and principal market for the agricultural products of the matanuska and susitna river valleys also with the opening of the new presbyterian hospital and the staterun psychiatric institute plus the alaska native hospital and the providence hospital more jobs have been opened up there is a very small negro professional group in anchorage with teaching being the major occupation oddly enough there are no negro men teachers but at least women teachers mrs delbert henry an anchorage resident since and originally from oklahoma has been teaching in the schools since she agreed along with many others that qualified people can certainly get jobs here if jobs are available she is a member of delta kappa gamma only negro member in alaska an international teachers sorority and is president of the elite social and charity club in april of this year this club presented anchorage negroes their first debutante ball schools in anchorage maintain a very high academic standing and are rated among the best in the country there are two high schools three junior high schools over nine elementary schools a community college alaska methodist university several african students have attended this university and several private schools incidentally school kids are very happy here because even though school opens in early september it closes in midmay aside from teaching the professional group breaks down to one privatelypracticing dentist dr joshua j wright and one privatelypracticing lawyer mahala ashley dickerson both of these people are highly thought of in their field and have a mixed clientele there are several businesses purportedly owned by negroes mcsmith enterprises a store that sells rents and repairs tvs a grocery store a janitorial service a newspaper a cocktail lounge several night spots and a few small eating places there are one or two barbershops and beauty parlors if you need the help of a policeman in a hurry dont look for a colored onethere arent any however there is one attractive negro metermaid at the same time there are no friendly colored undertakers just friendly white ones negro churches as such are in the minority not more than six however negroes attend the church of their choice wherever it is located there are over churches with all denominations represented however the majority of the negro ministers i heard speak appeared to be more or less selfordained the masons are the prominent lodge in anchorage and sponsor many dances and dinners throughout the year these activities are usually wellattended negro participation in the political scene is quite limited but one name that pops up frequently in the news is that of mrs dolores watson an outstanding negro woman in the community mrs watson and her husband william have been anchorage residents for the last years coming originally from yakima washington mr watson came to anchorage to work for the federal government and liked the looks of the country so well that he and his wife decided to make it their permanent home mrs watson is a onetime president and present treasurer of the local naacp and is one of the few negroes who takes an active part in many phases of community life she made an unsuccessful bid for the city council in but still works indefatigably for street sewer and housing improvement she is one of the two negro members of the anchorage womens club a member of delta sigma theta sorority member of league of alaskan writers and member of the local chapter of the northern lights civic and social club she definitely likes anchorage and was quick to say yes when asked if she would recommend other negroes coming here to live mrs blanche mcsmith was the first and so far only negro to become a member of the state legislature she is on the board of directors of the naacp and is the other negro member of the anchorage womens club if youre the kind of cheechako who likes to booze it up you would be reel happy in anchorage there are cocktail lounges listed in the phone book with of them on fourth avenue the main street in town this doesnt include eating places that serve liquor and little backstreet dives if you stand at one end of fourth avenue at night the end near the inlet you will be dazzled by all the gaudy red lights beckoning to you but considering the number of lights and bars on fourth avenue its uncommonly quiet at night three night spots highly frequented by negro and a large percentage of white patrons are the club oasis the mermaid room and the back street club the club oasis and the mermaid room have lively floor shows with entertainers imported from the states and at times the club oasis presents as many as three shake dancers in each show there are four newspapers in anchorage the anchorage daily times and the daily news are the two leading newspapers neither have a sunday edition and serve the entire community this includes pictures of all local people church and society news then there are two newspapers slanted toward the negro community the alaska spotlight a weekly has been in business for about eleven years and is edited and published by mr george anderson it is a tiny newspaper almost a pamphlet but it reports items in proportion to its size from all over alaska and the south mr anderson is a republican who made two unsuccessful bids for a seat in the alaska house of representatives the midnight sun reporter is relatively new on the scene being less than two years old but so far it has presented much food for thought aside from its regular news it is also a weekly and is edited by mr jim owens but neither of the two latter newspapers are as strong as they might be if they were in a lessintegrated community if you are a tv fan you would see your programs but they would be shown two to three weeks later than they appear in the continental states there are two tv stations and four radio stations in anchorage one quite interesting event occurs on the channel morning show each morning except saturday and sunday an employee from the alaska state employment office appears on the program and reads a list of some of the jobs available at the employment service this works extra fine for jobseekers too bushed to get up early and head for the employment agency if youre a budding poet you may get your poetry read by the announcer on the same show that is if you send it in the entire show is rather informal but definitely pleasing the teenagers have their usual platterspinning tv show and are up on all the latest dancesthe sputnik waddle collegian swim pony push and kick etc although anchorage has a large juvenile delinquency problem juvenile criminals here lean heavily toward burglary theft and drunkenness it still seems to be a wonderful place to rear children it offers plenty of fresh air and much space to move around in the teenagers and some adults do a lot of skiing iceskating bowling and housetohouse partying in winter during the summer months which are positively lovely much outdoor camping hunting fishing golfing and sailing are done as a matter of fact alaska in general is rapidly becoming a tourist mecca i must add however that the anchorage negro does not take as large a part in these activities as the negro from the two military bases if youre culturally inclined you can listen to the beautiful music played by the anchorage symphony also since its inception over eight years ago the alaska festival of music has proven to be a huge drawing card for alaskans and tourists alike many prominent concert artists appear in anchorage all year round but especially during the music festival in june ive been told william warfield appeared here and recently carol stanford one negro woman mrs betty mcdonald although not a perma nent resident of anchorage plays a prominent part in anchorage cultural affairs mrs mcdonalds husband edward is stationed at elmendorf as a member of the united states air force besides a regular job of teaching at one of the junior high schools mrs mcdonald has also taught on a parttime basis at alaska methodist university but she is primarily known in anchorage for her lovely voice she is a member of the anchorage community chorus and has also appeared as guest soloist in several concerts the league of alaskan writers which held a successful writers conference last october has one negro member mrs delores watson the name brady jackson is wellknown in the anchorage community he is the retired holder of the alaska heavyweight title and onetime coach of the elmendorf football team but aside from his physical activities he is an actor and member of the elmendorf theater guild he not only acts and designs sets for the group but in may of this year he did such a fine job of directing the play a streetcar named desire that he won a billiken award for being the best director of the season he won an additional award for recognition of the individual who contributed most to the guild during the season his attractive wife is also a member of the guild one event that draws people from all over alaska and the south is the anchorage fur rendezvous held in february of each year professional buyers from all over come to bid on fur pelts but one sport that is the center of all eyes during the rendezvous is the sleddog racing the big alaskan huskys come dashing down the middle of fourth avenue pulling the sleds with their drivers egging them on to the finish line for the last two years snow has been so scarce that the sleddog racing has been in danger of being eliminated from the festivities it is during this time that you will see many eskimos in their native dress either just coming to the festival from their villages to sightsee or to participate in the entertainment there is plenty of eskimo dancing and blankettossing etc also at this time a fur rendezvous queen is chosen in an attractive negro girl miss grace hill was one of the candidates if i didnt mention homesteading in this article a very important subject would have been eliminated this is the word that has brought many people to alaska trying to find a better way of life it has brought joy to some but disillusionment and heartache to many naturally i wondered if there were many or any negro homesteaders in or around anchorage i learned promptly that there are several including the gracious and highly articulate negro woman lawyer mahala dickerson attorney dickerson seems to be making a success of her homestead but many many others colored and white have not been so fortunate or persevering first of all there are two types of homestead lands the free land being given away in alaska is the description of the land handled by the federal government the filing fee for acres of this land is only the requirements are that the homesteader live on his land at least seven months a year for years cultivate oneeighth of it and build a habitable house many people use trailers with the wheels taken off since clearing the land digging a well cultivating and planting a crop are tremendous jobs and costly ones in alaska abandoned homesteads are a common sight on the other hand state homesteads are offered for sale at public auction and up to acres can be purchased the entire amount can be paid at once or the land can be bought under contract at per cent down ard years to pay at per cent interest incidentally single men or single women or couples are eligible for both types of land there are no special requirements connected with the state lands as there are for the federal lands however credits are given by the state for developments on or in connection with the land for instance land cultivated gets per acre credit credit per feet of fencing etc aside from the high costs and backbreaking labor of getting a homestead established many other factors have to be taken into consideration most homesteads are so remote that gas electricity plumbing and the most common household conveniences are so rare that its almost as if they never existed but if youre the adventurous type if youre charmed and intrigued by the thought of pioneertype living then homesteading is the life for you in the heart of town on fourth avenue there are huge letters strung across the width of the avenue that say anchorage allamerica city most colored americans in anchorage who like high on the totempole racerelationswise say this is potentially true but one old colored man summed up the situation beautifully when he said why yes child this city is prettymuch allright for us colored folks right now but if we dont hurry up and git some more real smart ones who know how to git more and more into everything going on it aint goin to be that way long them others is movin in pretty fast you know an urgent warning to the bereaved by ruth hayward he postman knowing the family well hesitated to ring the door bell when he did he said gently mrs bonner itsits fordonnie c o d i can take it back you dont have to accept it you know with trembling hands the bereaved mother reached for the package addressed to her dead son donald bonner at the top left was stamped the name of the sender bible distributors of america almost in a whisper she said donnie must have ordered itbefore his accident such a good boy my donnie how much five dollars plus the c o d charges it all comes to the postman said but you really arent obliged to take it mrs bonner unheeding she hurried to get the money from her depleted purse counting small change until she had the right amount thank youoh thank you she said breathlessly receiving the package and holding it to her as if it contained the renewed life of the son she had buried less than two weeks before oh thank you and so another grieving family unwittingly added to the increasing wealth of that crudest group of swindlers the grave robbers and hearse chasers these heartless swindlers read the obituary columns all over the country in preparing their salesucker list first the name of the deceased then the nearest of kin preferably a wife mother or husband then so supplied by cohorts in various towns they specialize in mail order deals the articles of merchandise traded most often in this particular scheme are usually bibles religious trinkets jewelry goodluck charms photographic frames wallets pens etc the list is limited only by the tricky imagination of these merchantswho see the sorrowing as ready customers of anything addressed to the deceased about people die yearly so it is easy to figure the tremendous resource at the command of these sorrowswindlers these bunco artists specializing in commercializing sorrow are of many breeds and schemes some work nationally by mail but others are just as hard at work locally with moving persuasions for expensive trashyart tombstones or gravemarkers for the deceased cashing in on the grief and sometimeslateremorse of the grieving they find the bereaved anxious to make amends by spending far beyond their means for a memorial marker at this time it does not concern the grieving that the marker is highpriced who thinks of price at such a moment one only wants to do the right thing they are easily persuaded by these suave swindlers that this is the last thing they will ever be able to do for the loved ones now silent forever but grief can never be assuaged by spending money your late loved ones would not want you to be so victimized so remember this when and if you are approached by any of these or other nefarious schemes you cannot make up anything you cannot spend yourself into peace of mind or relief from any kind of remorse you can only fall into a trap that mocks deep grief a spokesman for the national association of the better business bureaus alert to the various schemes of these swindlers in sorrow offers this advice accept nothing c o d if you did not order it if it is sent to you on approval to be billed later you do not have to pay for it even if you do not return it if you are approached with merchandise purportedly ordered by the deceased take time to investigate know your company let those involved know you are making inquiries mention the better business bureau and postal inspector likely youll never hear from this particular company again letterheads are easy to print so dont be fooled by highsounding ones neither should you deal with post office box numbers unless an address is also given take time to be sure grief is an urgent persuader but it cannot be really helped by becoming a victim of trickery these heartless swindlers are extremely busy and clever be constantly on guard against old and new angles give dignity to the memory of your loved ones use the money you might give these tricksters in other ways that will make a lasting memorial this you know best how to do for you knew your loved one best in his or her name give to a favorite charity church school or individual help or scholarship it need not be a large bequest even a rose bush will bring lasting beauty and remembrance of a loved one death and grief come to all but it need not be commercialized by goulish opportunists when we can make it a lovely quiet memorial of remembrance eric was eric by margaret burroughs ne thing about him v eric was himself and r j all of us accepted him as a bit strange perhaps he was excep v jh f tional or eccentric well being an artist should explain away some of it eric was different but he was charming and so he was okay with us the nucleus of chicagos south side cultural intelligentsia tall gangling his clothes hung casually and sloppily on his long brown frame his chocolatehued roundish face was lighted by goggily big eyes which seemed in a permanent state of excitement erics type can be found in any racial or national group he was an artist from hair to fingertips a most creative person his contacts friendships and associations cut across all barriers of race creed and class eric was a member of the human race i first met him at the close of world war ii when he popped up at one of the meetings of our artists council at the community art center he was so talented and charming that has application for admittance was accepted without a dissenting vote we swallowed eric whole hog it was just as if he had always been around we learned later that he had come from out east some place and had relatives there but he never talked about this and we never asked him eric sought out the south side to make his stake he was talented interesting and charming and that was enough his lips laughed often to expose teeth which had grown in crooked on one side in conversation his words tumbled out one before the other was finished not only did he use his voice to communicate but his eyes nose shoulders arms hands and fingers and his entire unarticulated body especially was this so when he talked about art for hours he would rave and rant on realism in art abstractionism nonobjectivism or socialist realism after reading hayakawa it was semantics when he met a group of psychiatrists it was psychology and psychiatry when he became tight with a number of humanities majors from the university it was parrington and kafka it was difficult to keep up with erics various trends and directions shortly after we met him he invited several of us over to the basement on th and giles to see his work we were introduced to his wife pamela a slender olive skinned woman from the cool manner in which she greeted us i assumed that she had long since regretted the impetuosity that induced her to marry an artist eric flailed his arms before his easel like a windmill you see he explained pointing to the canvas i feel as if im going into another abstract period ya ya take for example these storefront churches that ive been painting he placed another canvas before us a stylized conception of what state street used to look like with its storefront churches and primitive designs that were intended to give the impression of stained glass the composition was broken up into small planes of color im experimenting with disintegration of form you see no cant really tell how far ill take it that remains to be seen ya ya who knows where ill go from here we were deeply awed by erics paintings the boldly covered canvases gave a dramatic picture of the black belt which few had the vision to see even the denizens who were penned in there through his eyes the tormented tenements the twisted streets and the storefront cathedrals became a colorful panorama which made our ghetto seem less squalid and hopeless he could really lay on color he was an artists artist and we all agreed to that months later eric announced that he was an expectant father which made it necessary for him to get a regular job this would be good for eric we thought perhaps it would settle him down with his tremendous talent if he could only become stabilized we felt that he could become a significant name in art not only in the midwest but in the country the baby came a girl and he carried photographs of the child as he referred to her in his wallet and pulled them out at the drop of a hat see he grinned see how much she looks like me she looks just like me isnt that amazing shortly thereafter we never knew whether he moved away from pamela or if he was invited to leave but eric announced that he had rented a studio garage in little bohemia near the art center at th and michigan avenue home life is not conducive to my best work he declared i couldnt cut it i have to get away i had to do something this domestic bit wife and kid to support and at the same time this art thing tearing at your guts and too that twobit job and a twobit boss all of it was beginning to bug me man its got me looking for the couch i had to get out he had a ball fixing the place up painting and nailing and hauling in furniture from the salvage bureau on th street one afternoon i stopped in and noticed that he had set up a red and white striped barbers pole right in the center of the room probably a prop for one of his paintings ya kate his eyes danced how do you like it the barber pole i mean yeah yeah i just had to have it needed something to brighten up the place gonna paint it over in bright colors got it from that little shop on th at two am the other morning had a hell of a time sawing it too erics head swung around on his neck like a calder mobile during this period eric painted furiously sometimes working on five or six canvases at a time and working all night having divested himself of his job he eeked out money for rent and food with saturday night parties he set up a makeshift bar in the kitchen put some candles in mogen david bottles improvised a cocktail table from an old door got a case of beer and a bottle of whiskey and he was in business those were quite some parties he had up there and they attracted a strange assortment of people those studio rent parties of erics were something else we all used to go to them we felt better helping eric out rather than the guy around the corner who was totally disinterested in art because things were dull over on the east side the university set found out about erics and began to come a sign near the entrance read check your inhibitions at the door the lights were so low in the room that it took some time after you entered to find out who else was in the room there was dancing and music but the most interesting part of these parties were the discussions though host bartender and cashier still eric had time to preside over the discussions as moderator the topics everything art music the dance the theatre psychiatry semantics world conditions civil_rights the jewish question the negro question sex capitalism and communism just to mention a few yes those were some goodtime saturday nights but all good things come to an end and erics parties abruptly ended when some of the parents of the university students lodged complaints against the place as being a disorderly house and too the police were shook about the black and white makeup of erics guests they just didnt seem to dig negro and whites socializing together after a while we noticed that erics paintings seemed to be going through a change he now con ceived his canvases in small planes juxtaposed to each other with heightened color when you looked at them you felt as if the paintings were exploding what im trying to show eric told us is disintegration of reality nothing is constant everything is in a state of change flux either integration or disintegration take the world today it is in a very confused state that is what i am trying to express the state of the world today he waved his arms wildly all of my background is gray dirty dull that reflects the demise of western civilization now take my brilliant reds and yellows ah they reflect the emergence on the world scene of the oriental philosophies zen buddhism and mohammedanism i confided to shep his best friendsay old man erics acting a bit strange these days have you noticed how crazy hes talking seems the same to me what makes you think this notice how he talks way out like and this new kick in painting seems like hes cracking to me so who isnt in this messed up society i dont know i dont know you know eric eric is eric eric will make it then eric informed us that his wife was suing him for a divorce he grinned poor kid she couldnt take it must have started bugging her too really cant blame her when the decree became final eric celebrated with a big party he dropped by my place to extend the invitation ha ha how ya kate ya just dropped in to invite you to a breaking out party breaking out of the bonds of matrimony ya how do you like that didnt have time to get out the engraved invitations from fields you know just think i gotta pay alimony and all this really makes me feel like a substantial citizen after having made a couple of shows at the institute eric decided to try and make it painting full time he sold at the outdoor art fairs and began to develop a following i managed to buy one of his paintings myself on time of course it is one of his city scapes with no people in it a period he went through after he came out of his nude with black net stockings phase it is hanging on my wall now and i could have sold it many times for triple the price i paid for it especially after eric left chicago and the dealers and collectors realized the genius of his work a few months later he announced that the atmosphere in chicago was stifling his creativity that he was thinking of retiring to mexico for a year to paint though he mentioned that he would be leaving in a week or two we paid it no mind after all on a previous occasion he had announced that he was going to spain and before that it was italy then one monday morning shep and i stopped by his studio to see how he had fared over the weekend knocking on the door we re ceived no answer a push on the door opened it eric would be back we thought probably had gone for a weekend in the country but why would he leave the door open with all of his paintings tools and personal possessions inside several days passed but eric did not return word came to us via the grapevine that he had taken off suddenly for mexico it seemed that a couple of kids from the university one jewish and the other gentile wished to marry since their parents were against it they decided to elope to mexico and eric joined the party as an extra driver the only fly in the ointment was that the couple were minors and eric was chronologically an adult thus making him liable for transporting these kids across state lines without their parents consent both sets of parents appealed to the police to intercept the fleeing lovers and their errant chauffeur we had a few anxious days as we prayed that they would make it to the border and across detectives visited all of us at our studios seeking to find out which route the fugitives had taken but in all honesty none of us knew a thing eric was a talker but he sure had sense enough to keep this bit of intelligence to himself we all breathed much easier when an artist returning from mexico reported that eric and the kids had made it he told us that the two young people had married and become reconciled with their families that eric had rented a place in ajijic set one bottle of tequila on the shelf and had gone into business we didnt hear any more from eric for almost a year nor did his wife and child there was a mad scramble for his paintings another artist moved into his studio and held saturday night parties too but it wasnt the same yes erics sudden departure left a vacuum in our cultural set when we wondered would we ever see the likes of him again that crazy nutty unpredicable wonderful unscrupulous fellow one could not easily forget him at least i could not it was a year or so later on a trip to mexico that my husband and i decided to look up our old friend eric we heard that he had because of town pressure moved from ajijic to taxco we had no known address for him but off we went to taxco with the hope that just coincidentally we might find him coincidentally we did arriving in the town square we asked a small boy if he could direct us to senor eric el negro at first the child knew nothing but after we pressed a peso into his palm his memory perked up so senores you look for el senor negro meester eric i tell you you must sit in the club there and wait i will tell him you are looking for him he will come we made ourselves comfortable with a couple of tequilas con sangre and waited an hour passed and no eric my husband and i looked at each other making and accepting a mutual bet that he would or would not appear my husband was the doubter after another half hour had passed he glanced at his watch triumphantly so you got us into this off on a wild goose chase looking for eric he said eric is probably in veracruz or acapulco some place maybe even in jail he wasnt going to show i resigned myself to having to pay the bill then suddenly we heard that high nervous laugh floating in the door hi there folks welcome to sunny mexico ya ya as usual his words tumbled one over the other for his mind raced faster than the words could come out when did youse get to town how long you gonna stay hows everybody back in good ole chi the art center still open the old gang still around sitting down with us he joined in the elbow bending eric had not changed much but wee lines around his eyes and a puffiness beneath them indicated that things were not going as cheerfully as he indicated ya ya me im doing just fine just fine doing a lot of painting started in wood sculpture experimenting with collages also positive and negative space all the time he was talking he was popping up and down running to the door and looking out up the hill we questioned him with our eyes ha ha you can tell them back home that i havent changed a bit still up to my old tricks ya ya theres a little schoolteacher from texas up there red head sent word she wants me to paint her portrait ya ive got quite a clientele returning to the table he said say kate you and bill have another tequila and look dont pay ill take care of the bill im going up the hill and ill be back in fifteen minutes ya he nodded to the waiter mis amigos give them anything they want ill pay when i come back then ill take you guys to dinner si senor eric si the waiter smiled warmly at him erics charm had worked its wonders on the people of taxco too eric felt for his pocket he turned back to us just my luck to have left my wallet in my other suit and ive got to pick up a package at the post office look bill let me hold ten until i get back sure thing eric my husband handed him a bill why it seemed just like old times again i thought we relaxed and sipped on a third pair of tequilas con sangre it was certainly good to see eric again he was a long way from th and michigan avenue but he was still eric when he came back down the hill we would tell him that we had seen his little daughter and that she was growing up quite nicely and still looked a great deal like him and that his exwife pamela had married again or perhaps he knew all that ah but it was good to see him again my husband and i reflected on the delicious mexican dinner we would have with eric later we would sit and recall old times over some of the good mexican beer it would be very nice then we would take the midnight bus back to mexico city an hour and a half passed and eric did not return i looked at my husband oh eric will be coming any minute now he said lets have another tequila the waiter brought the drinks and placed the bill before us he was apologetic i dont know he said perhaps el senor eric will not come back today my son tells me that senor eric is this minute riding on the bus to cuernavaca he saw him with his own eyes and with him was a pretty senorita with red hair so i hope you do not mind paying the bill of course we did not mind paying the bill all fifty pesos of it back in mexico city we thought oh well one couldnt really be angry with eric he had such a darn charming way of doing you in ordinarily one would think that we had had enough of eric he certainly had a part of us but curiosity persisted and we always perked up when the grapevine brought some word of erics activities back to chicago we heard that he had married again a redhead that he had been lodged for safekeeping against an irate husband in a local jail that his zany unpredictable action had caused such a strain on the peaceful and friendly relations existing between the united states and mexico that the authorities decided the best method of keeping the peace would be to deliver eric back to the land of his birth which they did pronto eric didnt care to go to texas and california couldnt help itself so the next thing we heard was that he had set up a studio in market street in the bay city with his wife and small boy child the story should perhaps end here with me telling you that eric settled down to family life and responsibility carving a niche of respectability for himself in the san francisco art colony but no the following summer i visited san francisco and having heard that eric was there i decided to look him up remembering that after all he had been a very charming fellow back home and talented it would be interesting to see what he was doing and what had happened to his painting had he progressed or regressed in that disintegration of reality direction he was experiencing when he left chicago it would be interesting to know despite his leaving us high and dry in taxco i remembered him kindly eric was eric sure ruthless he was and irresponsible and unscrupulous but one thing he was charming i inquired and was given an address for him on market street shortly after arriving in town i sauntered out to look up eric finding no one at home i left a note on his door with my name and phone number but received no response i thought our old friend eric must have gone to spain because back in chicago he was always talking about going to spain to live and paint then one afternoon shortly before i was to return home i received a call from a friend of erics youre trying to find eric yes im an old friend of his from chicago is eric all right hes fine just been out of circulation for a few weeks out of circulation yes incarcerated well in custody really you want to see him yes oh yes be down to the county court house tomorrow at theres a sanity trial eric versus the city of san francisco i wasnt too much surprised even back in chicago we had regarded eric as being a little bit nuts eric must have come into conflict with the existing society poor boy but he was a good old friend and he had been charming and that far from home i felt he needed a friend so i presented myself at the courthouse the next morning i wished to be helpful and offered my services to his attorney so youre an old friend of erics from chicago thats good perhaps you can be helpful and tell us what he was like when you knew him oh ill be glad to do anything i can to help eric well be seated and i may call you to answer a few questions whats it all about i asked eric was doing all right here for the past year painting and selling enough of his work to take care of his wife and child then about six months ago his wife died leaving him with the boy age two it seemed that his wifes death shook him unbalanced him we think and he started withdrawing into himself acting irrational he was taken into custody on charges of neglecting the child allowing the boy to run wild in the street did nothing but sit looking out of the window on market street heard voices through the wall received messages over the radio that sort of thing the attorney told me further that in defiance of psychiatric recommendations that he sign himself into a mental hospital for treatment eric insisted on going through a jury trial as a test of his sanity the city acting in behalf of erics minor child charged that he was deranged mentally and morally unfit to be responsible for the boy erics attorney claimed that his client was not deranged or erratic but merely creative and artistic and that given a job or a patron he would be quite capable of discharging his responsibilities the trial began when eric saw me he twisted around and waved all the time winking his goggily eyes he smiled showing those crooked teeth and seemed totally unaware of the fact that this was serious business that his sanity was being tested he was the star of this show and was enjoying it immensely the trial proceeded with witnesses being called pro and con the judge was a gentleman of eighty years who clung tightly to a hearing aid the jury staid and respectable people included one japaneseamerican if things followed as they usually did i thought eric with his nutbrown skin wouldnt have a chance my name was called and nervously i took the stand i wasnt too certain however of my testimony in favor of his sanity as i sat down in the witness chair i reconciled my doubts with the thought that any eccentricities in his behavior could be equated with his creativeness artists were different otherwise how could they be artists the attorney for the defense leveled a number of questions at me the answers establishing that eric was an artist of recognized talent when he was back in chicago i told of the shows he had made at the institute and the prizes he had won at the atlanta annual i named a number of prominent midwest collections in which he was included i was proud that i had given eric a good sendoff in this respect erics attorney took a seat and now the attorney for the prosecution stood before me he brought out the fact that was the only person in the courtroom who knew the accused before he came to california is it true that you were an associate of the defendant when he lived in chicago five years ago yes sir tell me when you knew the defendant in chicago did you ever hear him speak of hearing voices through the walls of his studio no sir when you knew the defendant back in chicago did you have any evidence that he received messages through listening to the radio no sir back in chicago other than the eccentricities that go with being an artist did the defendant act in any manner that would lead you to conclude that he was deranged no sir thank you no further questions as i took my seat behind the bar i avoided looking at eric perhaps my testimony had not helped him at all the trial went on the case was rested the jury recessed having to catch an evening train i was not able to return to the afternoon session to find out the outcome i waved eric goodbye ya kate he called to me while being shushed by a bailiff everything gonna be all right tell everybody back in chi that im okay okay i hurriedly gave my address to one of his friends who promised to write me the outcome three days later back home i received a wire re eric jury hung new trial next month certainly i rejoiced ah that eric a couple of months later a letter from a friend of erics stating that he had been acquitted and had gone voluntarily into a veterans hospital for a rest the child had been placed in a foster home until such time as eric established himself i dont know whether he ever did erics painting of the disintegrating city scape still hangs on my wall the dealers have combed chicago for his paintings especially since a prominent art critic recalling erics brilliant faceted canvases mentioned that eric was a forerunner of the abstract expressionist movement in the midwest now everyone here who owns a painting by him is husbanding it closely including me i cant take you further we have come to the end of this story except for one last note some weeks ago on a return trip to the west coast i asked an exchicagoan how about our friend eric these days what is he doing the kid did he ever get him back nope never did doesnt paint anymore either just sits day and night in one coffee house or other doesnt work you know how charming eric was still is hes built up a coterie of disciples who keep him sheltered clothed and fed hes one of the revered leaders of the beats out this way i was sentimental for a moment he was a zany guy but nice maybe i should try and find him dont cautioned my friend i took his advice and so i cant tell you more about eric but really havent i told you enough already her middle name is spunk by frances hill herever she goes in w idlewild upper

dreamers of the kind dr_king represents north of the mason dixon line that is the dreamer who uses his air castle as a blueprint the dreamer whose morning coffee does not act as a chaser to his subconscious visions of manhood freedom and equality was the march on washington primarily a southern affair were the vast majority of northerners party crashers as so many recent newspaper articles attest most attempts to effectively channel the northern dream end in failure or moderate success which is of course the same thing the naacp in boston recently engaged in a power struggle with the boston school committee as to whether the predominance of negro pupils in schools in a predominantly negro community was due to de facto segregation as the naacp would have it or racial imbalance as the bsc termed it in a preliminary municipal election the school committee won a vote of confidence from the city just who bearsor should bear the responsibility for the northern dream or lack thereof the entire community of course but particularly the recent college graduate it seems to me the negro college graduate who comes or returnsnorth would be expected to begin almost at once to transform his collegiate dreams into reality his bold reforms as set forth in his final sociology papers his courage in leading southern sitins his hardhitting editorials in the college newspaper and espe dally his prophetic valedictoryall these point to the birth of a great leader an articulate spokesman for his people in the northern city of his choice what happens he moves directly into the ghetto without so much as stopping to explore the availability of decent housing areas begins teaching what else in one of the citys blighted areas soon buys a magnificent automobile relapses into the monosyllabic colloquial speech which identifies him as in and disappears into the group his bookcase becomes a record rack his desk a whisky cabinet or he comes to the northern metropolis gets another degree or two begins teaching what else makes a good marriage moves into the most expensive section of the ghetto and disappears entirely much of this comes about as a result of our leaders willingness to take discrimination and segregation for granted how can he do otherwise short of avoiding contact with his people upon his arrival he is met by the sad disillusioned host of the unprepared not only the unskilled and therefore jobless but those who unfortunately have prepared themselves for the wrong professions social worker teacher to name two of the most prevalent who have a pitiful tale to tell

traveled and studied in the u s and now in mobile simon and schuster has arranged his knowledge observations and opinions of us in an intricate pattern designed in itself to express something of the restlessness of the country for fifty hours beginning on a summer midnight his mobile wheels like a hawk over the fifty states in alphabetical order noting significant and not always beautiful bits of

names echo and reecho the european americans nostalgia for europe from which poverty had driven them or the names commemorate dead indians indians indian places buffalo historical areas yield natural landscapes seascapes birds plants of this continent they also yield paragraphs of the familiar documents both sacred and profane of our history and of our contemporary life sometimes in his own words or through dream sequences during the wheeling night hours but chiefly by means of elements of these our own familiar documents arranged in strange juxtapositions butor reveals his strong often savage insights for example he juxtaposes excerpts from william penns sacred peace treaty with the delawares a report of the pennsylvania militia eliminating a delaware village which had accepted christianity a history of the trappist monastery with ads for their preserves testimony from a salem witch trial and testimony of a seneca indian preaching a new kind of christian salvation through the peyotl cult the implication is inevitable that christianity was betrayed here by christians during the second midnight over washington d c a not unintentional concurrence the hawkeyed observer suggests that the murder of lincoln in the capital city has assumed the qualities of myth because it is a stunning representation of that obscure and laboriously forgotten primordial murder of red man

between the fantasies of our entertainmentconsumeradvertising dream life and the hot reality of the racial predicament which confronts us today in one sequence a kind of subconscious tirade is addressed to northern liberals by a southerner defending segregation only the south knows the depth of the negros resentment his potential strength and that the whole american way of life must crumble when the negro inevitably rises you have beaten us northerners we who were your ramparts as we were already beaten by the negro but when the negroes rise up then we too will have that moment of vengeance they have taught us to expect and closing our eyes we will grin the last hour of butors mobile is midnight in eden wyoming and the last place name is buffalo butors picture of the u s coincides too closely with those of such native americans as historian lerone bennett jr and observers james howard griffin and james baldwin to be lightly dismissed as a foreigners warped view a new york reviewer quoted on the dust jacket calls mobile as familiar as our roadsides and far funnier there is the brutal humor of a rough brotherly affection through some passages and theres bitter satire beyond that the book is about as familiar and funny as murder and that reviewer like another who condemns it as a confused inventory of smells tastes and statistics simply demonstrates the white americans dangerous blindness to our national situation that butor is writing about the last quarter of the book drags a little and butors observations are not all beyond challenge since he was here the negro people have indeed begun to rise and not all white americans have panicked away into freedomland but for anyone honestly concerned with building here and now finally and in fact a home of the brave and a land of the free this strong book will be interesting and salutary the charter of african unity e the heads of african states and governments assembled sw in the city of addis ababa

and a period of one year has elapsed such an amendment shall not be effective unless approved by at least twothirds of all the member states in faith whereof we the heads of african states and governments have signed this charter the o f united africa by kwame nkrumah meaning of the charter the charter of african unity must be regarded as the last but one step on the road to a continental union the exploiters of africa have grasped its implications they realize that we are out to make ourselves masters in our own house and to drive out relentlessly from the length and breadth of our continent those forces which batten upon us and keep us in political and economic subjection salaam in tanganyika this committee will be responsible for regulating the assistance from african states and for managing the special fund which is being created by contributions from all the independent african governments this means that we must accept as our primary task the extension of independence to all territories of africa apart from the sense of oneness and unity which impels us to go to the aid of our suffering compatriots in angola mozambique southern rhodesia south africa and other parts of africa still under colonial rule we know that none of the independent african states is safe so long as a single colonial ruler remains on african soil freedom fighters will take renewed hope and determination from the knowledge that their struggle is identified with the continued independence of the existing african states and is to be directed within a total strategy no longer will these freedom fighters who have been in the vanguard of the african revolution and the colonial liberation movement feel isolated from the mainstream of african independence and unity i am indeed happy that the goal which we set ourselves at our independence has been brought nearer we shall strive for it now not alone but with our brothers from all the independent african states the problem of rhodesia let us make our position perfectly clear on this vital issue in the past britain by force of arms imposed upon the people of southern rhodesia or to give it its natural indigenous name zambia an alien government designed to deprive the people of zambia of their lands and their mineral wealth britain was a party to the establishment of a government composed exclusively of minority settlers who had contrary to all conceptions of justice possessed themselves of the lands and resources of the inhabitants this settler government of southern rhodesia is now demanding that it should be granted independence in other words it is inviting the british government to set up a second south africa in the heart of our continent without taking into account the wishes of the majority of the people in that territory no african state could in any way accept such a travesty of morality justice and international law nor would we accept the undemocratic racialist counter proposals which the british government is reported to have made to the settler southern rhodesian government any government that is formed in southern rhodesia without the consent of the majority of its people will be unacceptable not only would we refuse to acknowledge any such government we shall oppose its entry into the commonwealth and into the united nations our recognition will only go to a government which in our view is fully representative of the people of zambia that is a government based upon universal adult suffrage employing the principle of one man one vote i cannot believe that any british government could commit the supreme folly and blunder of setting up at this stage of our african struggle for independence and unity a second south africa whose examples of the appalling evils of apartheid and minority rule are so glaringly manifested against the african population every single day i have left the british government in no doubt about the stand we are prepared to take against the setting up of an unpopular minority independent government of southern rhodesia this is a crucial and decisive moment in the history of southern africa the attainment of political freedom by the people of southern rhodesia would not only mean the setting up of a free and indigenous zambian state it would bring a message of hope and encouragement to african peoples elsewhere in southern africa who are denied any right to control their own affairs but zambia will in any event become free in truth of course the situation in southern rhodesia could have been solved as has been the kenya situation but for one factorthe proximity of southern rhodesia to south africa indeed the southern rhodesian settlers are nothing more than pawns in the game of chess now being played by the great powers over south africa the independence of the people of southern rhodesia is not in reality being considered on its merits it is considered only in relation to the south african situation south africa is probably the biggest impediment to the liberation and unity of the african continent and it is a question which we must face squarely and realistically the need for strength i am not unmindful of the grave difficulties which face some of us lack of capital economic weakness and political instability are conditions that have been responsible for the acceptance of economic and military dependence upon former colonial powers in some instances such as is obtained not only for development but even for meeting normal recurrent budgetary expenses it is an act of high courage on the part of sister states thus boldly to have set their hand to a policy of nonalignment which can hardly be in keeping with the policy of those on whom unhappily they find themselves dependent yet it is these states particularly that should find the greatest advantage in developing our african unity into a firmly welded concert of nations as a real political force with political direction under a central authority within which they can shed their economic and military dependence and regain their dignity proposals of aid need to be examined with care most of all we must beware of any kind of military help for it can so easily place us in the hands of foreign powers and make them in effect the arbiters of our fate apart from drawing us into their orbit they become intimately familiar with details of our defense structure and its strength they can even become the designers of our defense structure and place us completely at their mercy aid of this kind even where ostensibly free can be most dangerous costly in its consequences for it creates pockets of coldwar presence on the african continent and lets in the neocolonialists with danger not only to the harbouring country but to its neighbors to whom it poses an open threat above all it creates frictions and disputes that will disturb the unity upon which we have embarked and to which i am convinced all of us are sincerely dedicated that is why it is so urgent for us to get together within a centralized framework that will give shape and purpose to the agreements which we made at addis ababa coordination of our political and diplomatic policies harmonization of our economic educational and cultural activities collaboration in health sanitation and nutritional matters coordination in scientific and technical fields cooperation for defense and security will go their dilatory pace unless the organization of african unity is pivoted upon a centralized authority capable of giving effective political direction to these aims political and diplomatic cooperation cannot function in a void it needs some sort of a political constitution to direct it economic development in separate states is ineffective but with our combined resources governed by an overall plan we can make africa great prosperous and progressive above all the full development of all our countries needs the most economic exploitation and husbanding of our natural and human resources this is possible only on a continental scale if we are to extract the greatest advantage from the latest industrial and administrative techniques as applied to our extensive land mass and population the evil of racism everywhere equally in striving for african freedom and unity we cannot be indifferent to events in other parts of the globe which can vitally affect the progress which we make towards our goal it is in this spirit that we have concerned ourselves about such grave international issues as the sinoindian border dispute and the cuban situation in doing so we were not only serving the cause of world peace which is of vital importance to us we were serving the cause of african liberation and unity as well i believe that the forces now pressing for freedom and unity in africa will be strong enough to overcome any external obstacle yet we must not blind ourselves to the fact that one of the great causes of african disunity and of the maintenance of racialist and colonialist regimes on african soil is the disagreement and hostility which at present exists between the great powers imperialism and the socalled white supremacy are the basic factors of instability in africa and one of the contributory causes of world tention secondly unless the situation in south africa improves radically so as to afford opportunities for the majority of the citizens of that state to express their will in a government of their own country this could be a theatre for a world conflict racial oppression and injustice in any form cannot be condoned or ignored racialism is a blot on the conscience of mankind and the sooner it is removed the greater the prospects of world peace will be it is in the same context that one has to consider the problem of racial discrimination in the united states although the efforts now being made by the government of the united states to bring about a a solution to this longstanding problem in america are appreciated it must be stated that nothing except a bold and revolutionary assault on this moral obloquy and this grave crisis of racial confidence in the united states can bring about a speedy solution the afroamerican has been taught to appreciate the dignity of the individual living as he does in one of the most technically advanced countries of our time and yet at the same time he is being denied what is his essential and inalienable right the afroamerican did not choose to go to the new world he was dragged into america to help establish the economy of that country this he has done with great credit distinguishing himself in all fields of human endeavor in music law diplomacy art science and education he has achieved great distinction for america the united states has therefore a moral duty to accept the essential humanity of the afroamerican time is of the essence this at once raises the matter of speed and urgency this is everything in our march we must in africa crowd into a generation that experience and achievements attained through centuries of trial and error by the older nations of the world we do not wish to see africa set on a course in which her nations grow indifferent separate and competing directions until they develop into a confused and disorderly economic tangle of sixes and sevens because europe has become the victim of such economic circumstances that is surely no reason why africa should follow a similar course those who set the example of europe as an illustration for the need to develop step by step in africa do not seem to appreciate that africa need not begin by imitating the mistakes of europe after all what use is the experience of human progress if we who study its course fail to learn from its errors and muddles as i said at addis ababa this world is no longer moving on camels and donkeys speed has become a new potent factor in the progress of the world the progress of the modern man like the agile kangaroo leaps and jumps more than that we have to remove the gap between those nations and ourselves if we are to emerge from the grip of the economic imperialism that will retard us the longer it remains a master or even a part of our economy we have to keep in mind however that the gap is not a static one but that it grows as modern technology improves and its productive capacities and output potentials increase thus the gap can widen seriously and new dangers threaten us unless we hasten forward at a much accelerated speed consciousness of the time element among the leaders of independent africa was clearly revealed in the course of our deliberations at addis ababa this awareness enabled us to examine our problems with a striking sense of urgency it was responsible for the speed with which we were able to adopt a charter of unity for africa why then cannot we observe the same consciousness of time and the same sense of urgency in pushing forward our unity into a form that will give it direction and authority so that we can speedup our common development and advancement in the horizon of africas future i see clearly the bright dawn of a union government the birth of a great nation which is no longer the dream of a new utopia africa the sleeping giant is now awake and is coming into her very own
black muslims by calvin c hernton hen it comes to that w y zone of our lives where black meets white the oa north has aiways imagined himself as some kind of eternal liberal primarily this has two causes first the fact that the union army won the civil war provides white northerners with a readymade feeling of historical benevolence on the racial front second there is always the south at which northerners can point a castigating finger and swell their chests with pride that race relations in the north are much better than in the south care packages are sent southward to negroes who are being starved and maimed there are freedom rides sympathetic demonstrations fund raising campaigns and nonviolent antisegregation walks these things have inspired white liberals in the north with the illusion that negroes especially those above the masondixon ought to love themor at least appreciate them this is so true that white people all over the north are alarmed and disturbed about the increasing numbers of negroes who are turning their backs on white liberals and casting their lots with such groups as the black muslims the black nationalists and others of similar orientation there is fear in the air no negro can make a speech anywhere now without some white person asking are you a black muslimor what do you think about black muslims for the last several months this is all i have heard from every white person who conceived ot himself as a liberal and like most negroes i have lied or half lied i have given the kind of replies i know white liberals prererred to hear but now i have made up my mind to speak the truth as i see it or to use an ethnic expression i am going to tell it like it isnot only for whites but for negroes as well first of all racial conditions in the north are far from what white liberals have deluded themselves into thinking they are tnere is no need to dwell on the vast amount of public and private jim crow dis crimination and bigotry still being practiced against the northern negro nor can we speak appreciatively of the rate at which race relations are progressingafter all we have had three hundred years now again with the possible i say possible exception of manhattan and one or two other northern communities the negro must consult a map to make certain he is up north in the overwhelming majority of caseshousing education employment civil_rightsbeing a negro in the north has been little better than being a nigger in the south what is more in the north much of the inhumanity toward the negro or unfair treatment is less tangible than in the south it is legally invisible and almost impossible to prove for instance i was recently interviewed for a job by the director of a multimillion dollar social agency in new york city the director found nothing wrong with my qualifications yet as i sat there something seemed to be troubling him finally and quite calmly he informed me that if i were hired i would be the first negro to occupy a semiadministrative position in his agency i would be as he put it the jackie robinson of his agency he wondered if i could command the respect of those white who would be under me he especially emphasized the fact that would have to represent his agency to other institutions and business firms he was a nice man i sat there quietly smiling at him as i had seen sidney poitier do in a movie i did not get the position someone better qualified got it he happened to be white the purpose of the agency incidentally is to rehabilitate negro and puerto rican teenagers in an area where eightyfive per cent of the population consists of these two groups i have found that not only are there no negroes or puerto ricans in administrative positions in that agency but that the entire board of directors and trustees are all white too often the white northern liberal views the inhumanity toward the american negro as a socialwork problem a problem for individual dogooders and not one which requires the reorganization of the total american social structure when i say reorganization i mean redistribution of economic political and military power in such a fashion that the negro himself will be in a position to make sure that no one public or private can get away with treating him less than a man the fact is the northern white man liberal though he prides himself is not very different from his southern kinsmen the difference lies in the degree of selfdeceit unlike his southern brother the negro in the north no longer believes in the white liberal he no longer trusts him in the south where conditions are so terribly oppressive a white man can be a liberal by merely saying he is for voter registration or school integration on a token level but in the north where the more brutal and obvious forms of inhumanity toward the negro are passing away the wouldbe white liberal finds it increasingly difficult to be a liberal for that means doing something about the final remnants of jim crow doing something about the more subtle psychological and difficulttoprove modes of prejudice all of which the northern white man seems unwilling or unable to eradicate it is because of this that more and more northern negroes are being driven i say driven to abandon the white liberal for it is clear the liberal in the north is no longer a liberal but a hyprocrite at best he is a victim of seemingly an insurmountable selfdeceit to say the least this is what i felt as i listened to the director of that agency who was a jew and i am certain thought of himself as a white liberal a friend of negroes upon innumerable occasions and incidents this is what most negroes feel indeed every american black man at least once in his life has been seized by a passion of intense animosity for the white man if there were any such thing as justifiable hatred the negros hatred for the caucasian race could very well fit this category the rise of the black muslims and other such groups has grown out of the negros impatience with the white liberal and the not too invalid opinion that white men in general never intend to treator are actually incapable of treating the negro as an equal and the liberals are right as long as they maintain their present position on race their fear of northern negroes is not without grounds for like all modern negroes the black muslims mean business on the other hand white liberals are wrong about many other things for instance the black muslims and here i mean the muslim organization proper is not a movement founded solely on racial hatred and violence there is instead much hatred and malice toward the white man and plain insanity smoldering in the minds of northern negroes and i am coming to this but for now let us try to see the saner side or at least let us be fair something we have found impossible to be in the past when a negro asserts that by and large the white man is an untrustworthy hypocritical devil he is stating more of a fact than a lie he can prove his assertions by statistics history his own objective experiences and by what is going on this very minute not only in the south but all over the united states negroes who say they are superior to white people are not all saying so on the basis of a reverse racism but often because they feel they are more willing to be humane loving and democratic than the white man has proved himself to be contrary to what many whites think few muslims hate white people as a passion of the ego racism any style is based on lies myths stereotypes fear and guilt the black muslim movement is one expression of an historical necessity for the salvation of the black man in america just as zionism was a movement designed to deliver the jews out of bondage and alienation the white liberal should understand this if under prolonged trial and tribulation the jews could set themselves up as gods chosen nation is it so incomprehensible that god or allah has now after nearly four centuries of oppression selected the negroes as his chosen people what we should further understand is that the whole racial situation in america is itself absurd and insane the negro problem is a product of this situation let loose among the mighty impersonal forces of urban life yet regimented into fetid ghettoes like harlem and south side chicago the northern negro especially is prey to all kinds of doctrines and movements this is why the anger of the negroes has its riotlike momentum in the most advanced northern cities while the southern negro must fight like hell for the bare minimum of freedom the northern negro constitutes what might be called the liberated oppressed had the white man in the north been aware of what these negroes were feeling all along he could have predicted a movement such as the black muslims therefore had they been willing they could have prevented or at least mitigated it but it is too late for that now the american white man has always ignored the negros feelings until it was too late the point now is that the muslim movement is a mass movement in all mass movements there are ingredients that appeal to or produce psychopathic individuals if a movement cult religion or what have you is to be more than a hate group or a gang to perpetrate violence then other ingredients must be incorporated that will counterbalance or neutralize those that induce or appeal to psychopathy to some extent it is the discipline and the religious and intellectual training studying islam and arabic for instance which welds the black muslims into a primary collective energizes the individual muslim with a missionary zeal and gives him a sense of dignity and purpose on the other hand there are many negroes who have latched onto only the raw emotional aspects of the muslim doctrine and now we arrive at the point where it becomes hazardous for me to be honest but i shall try increasing numbers of negroes are being drawn from the ranks of the young avant garde generation who are not actually members of the black muslims but who are nevertheless adopting a psuedomuslim orientation toward the white man they are pseudomuslims because for one thing they have not truly abandoned the white mans values their hatred for whites is really a mixture of selfhatred and envy of the white man their claim to racial superiorty is an inverse expression of their feeling of racial and personal deficiency such negroes are afflicted with what i call the syndrome of blacknessthey are in turmoil with themselves they actually feel inferior because of their color alone and want to become a part of integrated or assimilated into the white world thereby losing their inferiority the attempt to assimilate however is constantly frustrated by the white mans bigotry insincerity and his deep psychological block against negroes the negro is thrown back upon himself his selfesteem is bankrupted racial rage corrodes his psyche the white man mirrors his alter image but the white man denies him the negro therefore hates not only himself but the white man as well he talks and behaves like a schizophrenic preaching black supremacy and hatred of whites on the one hand on the other hand haunting integrated circles bars coffee houses and parties smiling into white faces and incessantly trying to woo the white woman this is the negro you should fear most he is dangerous he wants to eat his color and have it too he has come to an impasse with himself he is the worst kind of racist hating both races he wants to be white and black at once one kind of racism is equally as insane as another i do not wish to exchange one lie one myth for another no matter how functional it may be if the mind of the white southern racist is a sick mind it is inescapable that the mind of the black northern racist is equally dis eased the psuedomuslim oriented negroes in the north are too often selfstyled hipsters hangerson with little talent or any real qualities by which they can trust themselves to rise in the world they need a bandwagon on which to ride their color becomes that bandwagon at the core of their problem is the psychology of the tough criminal with a chip on his shoulder they do not owe the world anything they think the world owes them everything like the white southern racists they are forever on guard to exploit and intimidate the white man especially the most honest sincere liberal types beware particularly is this true when it comes to the white woman i have witnessed time after time the deliberate unprovoked intimidation of many of my friends by such negroes simply and only because they were white it is a form of racial blackmail practiced on the liberal especially the neophyte liberal there is a strange kind of sadism involved for not only is it masochistic it is selfintimidation also i sat in a bar known for its mixed clientele several negroes were at my table and two white persons the negroes dominated the con versation everything they said for at least an hour smacked at how immoral bigoted and inhumane every white man in america is r they hated the naacp it was run by white people they hated core also run by whites they hated kennedy and stevenson and mrs roosevelt they found ways of putting white people down they had never heard of or seen meanwhile all africans were great and no white jazz musician was as good as a black jazz musician all the time their eyes were deliberately fixed upon the two whites who very uncomfortably remained at the table i sat quietly and watched them a sickness rose up in me almost everything they said was inaccurate even though one had a college degree and all of them had studied something they were actually illiterate many northern negroes are racial hypochondriacs they are obsessed with racial suffering both real and fantasied they deliberately provoke situations where they can be hurt their aggression is false they are raceniks gaudy hitchhikers trying to steal a ride to a place they do not want to go of course it is not altogether their fault but this is not the question the fact is these negroes are sick people and it is time they faced up to their illness and made a positive attempt at doing something about it on the other hand and this must come hard the fear that northern liberals feel because of the rise of black muslims is valid but only half valid white liberals are guilty themselves their anxiety represents their guilt moreover the other half the valid half of their fear is misplaced consider few negroes can ever become black muslims or black anythings for most of them are hooked so to speak on american values white values their identity can never be anything other than american whatever that may be no amount of energy spent on embezzling an identity such as wearing the hair au natural and calling oneself afroamerican can actually make the negro african definitely american standards of beauty and esthetics will undergo changes under the impact of african influences but changing ones style of dress or switching labels will not erase the facts of the negros life experiences in this country upon which the mystique of his identity hangs it can only hide such facts most negroes look the way they look speak walk and think they way they do because of what has happened to them in america and for no other reason and what does all of this mean for white liberals it means they should not fear the swelling ranks of muslims and muslimlike movements but fear the cause of these movements which is nothing more than the white mans bad faith ignorance and selfdeceit in all matters dealing with race relations in the north because of the white liberals somnolence and recalcitrance in the face of the mood of the negro race relations in the north are going to get worse before they become better what happened in harlem and elsewhere on the various nights of the birmingham rallies is omen for our times the negros anger at the milkwarm nonviolent shadowboxing of northern liberals will flare up boldly with increasing frequency and intensity all over the north it will spread west but by doing everything possible even at the risk of painful selfupheaval to immediately bring about equality and respect for the negro as a human being and a citizen the white liberal can avoid much psychological agony and violence goodbye america by jane rogers clay ou are my country i v am yours you have jl made me have created me out of yourself but you do not want me

and i was sorry that i was black i knew that black children were not as good as white children or as smart or as pretty or as kind i knew that you did not like black children i knew that you did not want black children i did not know why this was so but i knew it was so when i went to school i walked eight blocks past the school for white children which was two blocks from my home in school i used the books that the white children had discarded every morning the teacher read the bible and the class pledged allegiance to the flag i pledged allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all but not for me i learned things in school i learned to read to write to spell to sing and to draw these were the things i was supposed to learn i also learned some other things i learned to wonder i learned to think this is where i made my mistake i learned the things i was not supposed to learn i learned to do things which i was not supposed to do i went to the concerts for public school children i sat in the back behind the white children the music sounded the same from the front or the back i learned this years later when i was allowed to sit in the front i went to the library the colored branch one day i went to the main library the one the white children went to my teacher took me she took the whole class we did not go to get books or to do the things the white children did there we went to sing for a recording that was the only place it could be done my teacher told us we must be very neat and clean that day she inspected each one as we arrived at school one girl could not go because her dress was old and torn the teacher told us we must walk slowlv in twos and we must m be very quiet we must not chew gum or laugh or touch anything the white people would not like it if we did any of the things she told us not to do and would not let us come back again we sang four songs on the recording one of the songs was go down moses go down moses way down in egypt land tell old pharaoh to let my people go i went to sunday school the teacher read stories from the bible she told me about god and about jesus she told me that god created me in his own image she told me that jesus was the son of god that he loved me that he died on the cross for me one day she showed me a picture of jesus he was white i went to church the preacher said i must repent of my sins i must accept jesus if i wanted to be saved he told me to pray our father who art in heaven hallowed by thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven thy will be done in america as it is in heaven the streets up there are paved with gold jesus loves me this i

to be a movie star so she was myree johnson we played paper dolls they were pretty and had long silky curls they also had beautiful clothes and were rich and white one christmas we got a doll a big doll with blond curls her name was mimi she was sitting under the christmas tree in a chair with her name printed on it the chair was yellow with blue letters mimi used to belong to a white girl named mimi the chair had been hers too the four of us shared the doll and the chair that had been mimis we did not know mimi but knew she was white and rich and wished we were white and rich sometimes i pretended i was mimi and sat in the chair that had mimi printed in blue letters one day i went to the supermarket with my sisters we passed some white children sitting in a front yard there go some brown pecks one of them said were white pecks and theyre brown pecks i smiled at the white pecks and did not mind being a brown peck when i was in high school i won an essay contest i wrote an essay on how to prevent tuberculosis i did not know how to prevent tuberculosis but i wrote the essay i won first prize i was in the tenth grade and i made an a in health because i won the contest the contest was only for colored schools because colored people have more tuberculosis than white people the first prize was forty dollars i went to a luncheon at a downtown hotel the health counselor at my school took me she told me to be neat and clean and not to chew gum she did not have to tell me to be quiet she inspected me before we left at the luncheon we sat at a table with two nuns and two white girls i received my prize and a photographer from the newspaper took my picture the picture was in the paper the next morning he had my address wrong with my prize money i bought a red skirt and a white blouse with red velvet ribbons for myself i bought my mother a blue dress with a lace jacket for ten dollars and ninetyeight cents the next day my father died two days later we had the funeral he was a veteran the government also gave us an american flag my father fought the second world war he was an american when i graduated from high school i went to the state university i was excited i was to stay in a dormitory i had to send a photograph with my application for the dormitory when i arrived at jewell hall the fourth counselor told me my room was d she said i would have a single room i had looked forward to having a roommate the janitor took me upstairs in the elevator he said to me you are the first one but two more are coming i knew what he meant i smiled i unpacked and the counselor took me to meet bettye and billie they were not in their room she did not introduce me to anyone else later i met bettye and billie and they came into my room to talk in a little while the assistant housemother tapped on the door and said that we were making too much noise she smiled when she said it and we smiled and we did not talk anymore they went to their room and i went to bed after that it seemed we were always making too much noise one day we saw the assistant housemother downtown and she did not speak the housemother had a friendly chat with each of the girls she asked me if i liked my room i said yes she asked if i had any problems i said no i did not go back for my second year i transferred to a municipal university the oldest one in the united states i do not live in a dormitory i live at home and it is hard to study there because the house is small and all the rooms open into each other i go to classes and sometimes i study in the library i sit by myself usually when i sit down no one sits beside me one day a girl moved when i sat down the next day she put her purse and her scarf and her books on the chairs around her i sat in the back of the room by the door i do not go to any clubs or activities although i would like to i think i am not wanted once i went to a club and one girl smiled at me sometimes people in my classes smile at me but they do not sit by me sometimes i smile back sometimes they ask me for an assignment or what happened at the class they missed sometimes i ask them but not often not if i can help it when i am with them i feel very very black very very stupid very very inferior when they laugh i think they are laughing at me when they look at me i think they are looking down on me i do not like to feel this way i want to cry to scream to hit them all of them who make me feel this way but i cannot cry that would show weakness i cannot scream that would show madness i cannot hit them that would show rashness so i hate them for making me feel this way and i hate myself for feeling this way and i hate my country i hate america for making me hate so i want to go away far away from it all i do not know where i will go but i will go because i must this is my country but i cannot live in it i will go to another country where i will be called a foreigner maybe people will be kind to me my country is kind to foreigners but i will not care if people are not kind to me in other countries i will go on i will not stay where they are not kind to me i will go on and on until i am away from everyone i will be somewhere on a mountain or by a lake or in a forest away from all people i will live there or i will die there i do not know which and i think it does not matter i cannot live in alabama i cannot live in kentucky i cannot live in new york i cannot live in california i am an american i will go maybe some day i can come back maybe some day i can live in mississippi goodbye family goodbye friends goodbye home maybe you will remember me goodbye america radicals are not by james r phillips s a writer whose work ja y has been accepted by several of americas outspoken ultraconservative magazines i feel i have as much right as the ksi sii next man to speak for the radical right and i believe the time has long since come when the radical right if it is to gain the respect it deserves as a legitimate movement in modern america must disown all the segregationists segregation as a concept is totally alien to the philosophy which stands at the root and heart of todays ultraconservative movement if any man be a segregationist he cannot be a true radical rightwinger and conversely no man who is truly a radical rightwinger can be a segregationist this fact is or by rights ought to be selfevident recent events make it clear that the fact is not selfevident and so i propose to right here and now set forth the principles of rightwing radicalism and invite all those who cannot live up to these principles to get themselves out of the modern ultraconservative movement and to go as far away from us as they can i would like to suggest south africa as a place they might enjoy for the philosophic basis of modern ultraconservatism is the natural law and the natural law as most people know holds that all men are created free and equal no one who believes that can possibly be a believer in white supremacy for the very idea of natural freedom and natural equality stands as an eternal contradiction to the claims of any race to be supreme yet still we are confronted by statements such as this ill never give up either to integration or communism they are one and the same as far as i am concerned i dont think any of you want a nigger mayor or a nigger police chief but i tell you thats whatll happen if we play dead on this park integration those words were spoken quite recently by art hanes ousted ex mayor of birmingham alabama the only major city in the united states still segregated exmayor hanes words are an affront to reason because they are so obviously untrue and even immoral many men of good will have chosen not to answer these words they are afraid that if they become involved in a duel of words with this rabid segregationist they will themselves be tainted they are fearful of the old political adage that you cant roll in the mud with a pig without getting dirty because most men of good will do not refute his words he stands unchallenged as a leading spokesman for what most people assume to be ultraconservatism i hereby challenge exmayor hanes right to speak for ultraconservatism in fact i challenge his right to even call himself an ultraconservative he is to be plain and simple in the choice of words a demagogue and nothing could be more alien to the concept of ultraconservatism than racist demagoguery mr hanes said that he doesnt think anyone wants to see a negro police chief well as an ultraconservative i voted for a negro for the position of attorney general of massachusetts last fall this man edward w brooke a brilliant lawyer was elected as chief law enforcement officer of the commonwealth of massachusetts he has done a darned good job so far he is moving to restore the atmosphere of integrity that was once the hallmark of massachusetts politics so many people are pleased with the job this man is doing that there is now talk in republican circles in this state of offering him the nomination for u s senate if he chooses to run and his opponent would be none other than teddy kennedy himself he would have at least a fair chance of victory he was the only republican to survive a democratic landslide in massachusetts last fall the prospect of my state sending a negro to represent us in the u s senate doesnt bother me at all personally id consider it to be a big improvement over the obnoxious little brother of the president now representing us in the senate if it would bother the ousted exmayor of birmingham alabama then one of us must be a traitor to the radical rightwing movement i feel the fact that my articles have been accepted by several national publications proves that my views are in accord with national ultraconservative thinking that means he must be the one who does not belong in the rightwing movement so i hereby invite him to get out of this movement and to take with him everyone who thinks like he does i dont think it will be any great loss to the ultraconservative movement and i know it certainly wont be any great loss to the nation the radical rightwing movement of today rests foursquare on the principles that motivated abraham lincoln and if any man seriously believes that lincoln would agree with mayor hanes then that man has not read history carefully abraham lincoln was a contemporary of karl marx and the record shows that lincoln forcefully and convincingly refuted the ideas of marx more than years ago yet lincoln did not feel that because he was an anticommunist he also had to oppose freedom and dignity for negroes many southerners to this day like to claim that the civil war was fought by the north to preserve the union to some extent this is true but it is only a halftruth it was no accident that the civil warwhich hung as a threat over america for a generation broke loose in all its bloody terror at precisely the time that lincoln was elected president lincoln had often expressed in public his personal wish that all men everywhere should be free in he won a plurality in a fourway race for the presidency southern states began seceding at once from the union by the time lincoln took the oath of office civil war had become inevitable to many in the north it was a holy crusade to free the negroes note the words in the battle hymn of the republic wherein does that battle song proclaim the preservation of the union as the number one goal of the north it did not rather it spoke of a wish to make men free the last time i checked a history book it said that the north had won the civil war since the north did win that war the principles which motivated that war should be by rights part of the american tradition the principle of freedom was the paramount cause of the war and it should be by now the basis of american tradition apparently men like mr hanes still do not believe that the south lost that war they are trying to preserve a prebellum southern philosophy as individuals they have a right to do sobut not in the movement which seeks to stand fast on the principles of abraham lincoln thus as an ultraconservative myself i must charge again that hanes cannot speak for us nor indeed can anyone who thinks like mr hanes speak for us not only are they out of step with the thinking that lies behind the rightwing movement of today but they also are out of step with the best of their own southern traditions lincoln himself stated that he had drawn his political principles directly from the thinking of a southernerthomas jefferson can mr hanes or any other man say that jefferson author of the declaration of independence and founder of the party he called republican which now calls itself democratic would agree in the slightest with the philosophy of to days white citizen councils how could anyone make such a statement and how could anyone claim that gen robert e lee another great southerner would have any sympathy with modern white supremacist views gen lee despised slavery and sought justice among men his heart was torn in two when he had to make the decision to return to virginia and lead the southern armies his conscience led him to defend the states rights views of jefferson who let it be remembered was so hostile to the strong central government under gen washington that he created a second party to stand for states rights he called that party republican simply because he wanted to remind people that we were a republic now many rightwingers have been criticized today for a slogan that says this is a republic not a democracy the criticism is i believe caused more by the hypocrisy of some southern white supremacists than it is by the slogan itself the slogan is historically valid it comes from a statement made by benjamin franklin as he was leaving the constitutional convention of a woman asked him if we had an aristocracy or a democracy he replied neither madame you have a republic if you can keep it now i do feel that it was a mistake for the rightwing movement of today to omit the word aristocracy we dont have one from its slogan this tends to make some people think that the rightwing movement is an aristocratic movement i can say from personal experience that this is decisively not so it is basically a middleclass movement why do i think it is important to stressas jefferson did when he began his new party in that this is a republic let me answer this with an example ancient greece was a democracy and in this democracy the majority could vote to grant or deny rights to individuals the individual had no rights in greece except those granted to him bv the majority through their political formthe state because of this greece had slavery a foul and odious evil when brave men such as socrates questioned such evil facets of the greek society they were liquidated socrates was orderedby a majorityto drink from the cup of poison hemlock here in my home state of massachusetts we had a democracy in the very early days the pilgrims and their fellowpuritans did not adopt the plantation system of rich planters so popular in southern colonies here from the day of the mayflower compact every basic decision was made by a majority voteand gradually the franchise was extended to include all men this democracy produced some unfortunate excesses for example the quakers were denied religious freedom and some were hanged on boston common as in greece the individual here had no absolute rights of course the democratic and collective spirit of the puritans in their early davs did produce some noted advantages boston for examole had set uo a free public school years before karl marx offered the idea to europe as a bold new innovation in his communist manifesto as a deep believer in our pilgrim tradition i naturallv take offense at those pennvpinching southerners who oppose spending on public schools especially for negroes on the grounds that such schools are communistic they are no such things they are as american as the mayflowerfor the pilgrims actually came to america to set up schools for their children who were learning the dutch language and foreign customs during their exile in holland from to boston and the massachusetts bay colony also had some of the worlds most advanced social welfare legislation we were as we are to this day a commonwealth and this word derives from the words common and wealth the idea of sharing took deep root here very early as a result we had few rich and almost no real poor we were basically a middleclass society with free public schools the best possible ground in which to plant the seed called democracy yet even here it fell short of its potential gradually the puritans began to go beyond the collective democratic traditions of our commonwealth we began to evolve the theory of individualism this theory was later to be promoted vigorously by such bay staters as ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau but earlier than that it was imbedded in our state constitution by such patriotscholars as john adams the supreme court of massachusetts declared slavery illegal in this state in four years before the american constitution was written because our constitution contained the phrase all men are born equal the court ruled that the constitution did not say just white men but rather all men the philosophy of a southerner thomas jefferson had won its first great battleright here in massachusetts unfortunately it did not win the battle for mens minds in the south it has not apparently won the battle to this day if i understand correctly the political philosophy of gov ross barnett of mississippi he feels that a majority in any one state has the right to deny individual rights to citizens of that state now that is not a new philosophy it was advanced by stephen douglas during his debates with abraham lincoln of course lincoln rejected such a notion out of hand he would as a jeffersonian he stated boldly that all men are by right free no democratic majority has a right to deny one man or men or men that freedom that is because fortunately we are a republic that is to say we have a bill of rights this bill of rights sets forth certain rights that individuals have rights that the federal government cannot take away from individuals even if per cent per cent per cent or per cent of the ople vote in a moment of temporary madness to take away such rights of course the people have a right to change the constitution through amendments but jefferson had stated himself in the declaration of independence that governments should not be radically changed except for good reason and the founding fathers made the process of amendment a long one to give people time to cool off before they rushed through amendments they might reject later the th amendment extended the protection of the bill of rights so that individuals were protected against state laws which tried to take away their individual rights thus the constitution prevents a majority of citizens in any one state such as mississippifrom inflicting a tyranny of the majority upon helpless individuals in a minority in that state here you have the essence of the rightwing slogan that this is a republic not a democracy put this way it really doesnt sound so bad in fact i think it sounds quite good thats why i get perturbed by southern racists who claim to be rightwing ultraconservatives and who nevertheless demand the right to have a democratic majority nullify the rights of individuals they are frauds hypocrites and liars that doesnt bother me what bothers me is that everyone who hears them thinks that all of us rightwing ultraconservatives are frauds hypocrites and liars for example i recently sold an article entitled negroes are winning equality in boston the boston story june to negro digest the editor of that publication a sensitive journalist seemed surprised that a rightwing radical like me could be so enthusiastically in favor of negro rights i wrote him a letter tying to explain that the difference between southern racists and myself is that when i say i believe in the bill of rights i mean it and they dont i hope he believed me but i rather doubt that he did he has no doubt been burned too many times by hypocrites to trust anyone any longer and thats what really bothers me about white supremacists russia has turned down a road that seems to lead towards racism they have been segregating and persecuting negro students from africa and they have begun shooting people predominantly jews reopening memories of zsarist pogroms from oldendays for economic crimes i believe that minority groups would turn again to the american system of free enterprise and constitutional safeguards of individual freedoms as their best and only hopeif the white supremacists were not discrediting those solid old american ideals let me give you two contrasting examples of the good and the bad in the rightwing movement to make my point anger at hypocrites clearer first lets take arizona this state most people agree is the hotbed of rightwing thinking in america today if rightwingers were really all racists this state would be more racist than alabama or mississippi yet look at what really happened the rightwingers in arizona repealed an old state law that prevented mixed marriages miscegenation the rightwingers believers in individual freedom held that it was solely a matter for the indivdual to decide and not one the state had a right to intrude upon can any negro take offense at the states action in leaving up to individuals whether they wished to marry in their own race or out of it i dont see how a negro could be anything but pleased by such an action i think it speaks clearly of the philosophy behind the current rightwing movement but then look at california by contrast i understand that rightwingers are quite strong out there too i also understand that two of their favorite bogey men today are milton eisenhower and supreme court chief justice earl warren i wont go into the reasons for such hostility on the part of rightwingers except to say that it is no secret warren has been a target for racist criticism ever since his opinion in the school desegregation case again what bothers me here is the hypocrisy early in world war ii earl warren was attorneygeneral of california he got the federal government to set up concentration camps for japaneseamericans from californiaincluding americanborn american citizens milton eisenhower was commandant of that nowinfamous concentration camp i wish i thought that today s critics of warren and milton eisenhower were all warreneisenhower critics years agobut i have my suspicions that many of todays critics were then among warrens and milton eisenhower s greatest fans the antijapanese hysteria in california then was obviously raciallymotivated after all hawaii did no intern its japaneseamericans wisconsin did not intern the germanamericans who had been attracted to midwest bund meetings during the s here in massachusetts where the yankees had shown what they thought of the flood of italian immigrants during the saccovanzetti trial in the mids no one proposed a concentration camp for italianamericans ven though many such people had not taken out citizenship papers and were still sending money home to italy when war actually broke out i personally have my doubts about earl warren and milton eisenhowerand my doubts grow out of their leadership in that concentration camp matter they proved then that they are alltoohuman and thus fallible they have made serious mistakes in judgments in the past and i now feel i have a right to maintain reasonable doubts about their wisdom and their infallibility but my doubts rest on their action against a racial minority not out of more recent acts in favor of such minorities thus i feel i am consistent in my rightwing views but that the racists are not i want to preserve all that is best in our tradition they seem determined to perpetuate all that is worst i have no hope of convincing honest and reasonable men of my sincerity and of the value of my idealsso long as white supremacists cloud peoples minds with their hypocritical babblings thus i hereby attack these phoniesand invite them to get out of the rightwing movement i want to see it made pure and decent what christianity did for africa by laurian cardinal rugambwa hristianit y most that precious is the thing africa has received from the west at an early date in christian history africa saw the church take roots in its soil st mark disciple of st peter founded the church at alexandria and flourishing christian communities soon existed all along the southern shore of the mediterranean the names of st augustine bishop of hippo st cyril bishop of alexandria st cyprian the martyrbishop of carthage head the lists of the christian saints and martyrs of north africa however this christian influence never penetrated south of the sahara and by the seventh century islam had replaced christianity in north africa the history of the church is made up of swings of the pendulum bright hopes followed by unexpected declines a step forward somewhere with a step backward elsewhere several heroic but rather unsuccessful attempts to christianize tropical africa were made during the th th and th centuries at one time great hopes sprang up in the th century at the conversion of the king of the congo whose son became a bishop of this christian kingdom nothing remained a century later however at the end of the th century and the beginning of the th century the christian faith began to be permanently implanted along the coastline of africa the slave trade had kept the center of the continent closed to christian influence it was only after the middle of the th century that christian missionaries began to move inland missionary work on a large scale in central africa did not get under way until the th century the progress of christianity in africa has been fantastic lacking reliable statistics for total christian population i shall use my own church as an example in there were only catholics in africa and by the number had only increased to and by only to then began the amazing period of growth in in and today the mark has been passed although future increases are not expected to be so spectacular one can never tell when dealing with a continent as vast as africa christianity has brought many benefits to the africans the greatest of these has been a strong faith in god africa has always accepted the existence of a one true god creator of heaven and earth but this belief was clouded by superstitious preoccupation with a world of lesser spirits christianity has liberated africa from the centuryold servitude of superstitious fear and practice in the sphere of human relations the christian faith has communicated to africa a knowledge of and respect for the basic human rights of the individual christianity has also given to africa a concern for the whole man not merely his spiritual and moral welfare but his physical economic and social welfare as well this has come by doctrine preaching and by the inspiring example of generations of selfsacrificing missionaries time was when the word missionary conjured up a vision of a father with a long beard sun helmet and high boots or a sister robed in white habit and veil but nowadays a missionary may just as easily resemble the ordinary young man and woman you pass any day on the streets of america or europe lay people are now coming out to africa in increasing numbers convinced that they have a special part to play here in the establishment of christianity they do not regard themselves as a stopgap because the number of priests and religious is too few for the work to be accomplished nor do they merely have the idea of placing their professional knowledge and skill at the service of the church they see their task as the christianization of the new milieu in which they find themselves their main objective is to give a practical demonstration of what it means to be a christian at home at work at leisure and in all the ordinary circumstances of life concern for the sick and diseased for orphans and the aged has always been a part of the christian tradition you are all familiar with the fine work of dr albert schweitzer cf lambarene in gabon but you must realize that there are thousands more devoted medical missionaries who have labored unheralded for years in littleknown corners of the african continent but it is in the field of education that the missions have brought perhaps the greatest contribution to the elevation of the african peoples in the not toodistant past the only schools in tropical africa were those built and run by missionaries colonial governments have recognized encouraged and supported this missionary endeavor in the field of education todays african leadersin every field government the professions and the churchowe much to the men and women who devoted themselves to the long painstaking process of leading an entire people along the arduous path of education i myself can testify to what has been accomplished in this field in tanganyika the catholic church has over young men and women under instruction this is just about half of the entire school population of the country the overall influence of christianity in africa is far greater than bare statistics might indicate although africa is only per cent christian the spirit of christianity has exerted a large influence on the development of the continent the fact that the majority of the educated class have received a good christian education has been one of the principal causes for this influence the church is beginning to take root in native structures it is not yet a hundred years since the first africans of modern timesthe martyrs of ugandashed their blood for christ today the christian seeds have sprung up and keep springing up from this soil made fertile by their blood and by the many sacrifices of the missionary generosity of the christian west the catholic church has chosen over africans for its hierarchy from among the african priests now in her service however the establishment of christianity does not mean only the conversion of individuals but rather the christianizing of a culture and this takes time bringing the christian mentality to african society is a process that grows slowly africans in general and african leaders in particular must realize this basic truth there is nothing in authentic christianity which is incompatible with the true values of our tradition and culture the gospel message will never require the elimination and destruction of what is good in our life and there is much that is good in the tribal structure and tradition christianity elevates and purifies where necessary but it does not destroy basic human values from an address before the national press club during cardinal rugambwas first visit to the united states by george e hardin tough

but never has the little island realm had such exciting and saguinary drama as in the reign of its good king henri a century and a half ago henri christophe was a fullblooded negro of giant stature and strength uneducated and totally illiterate all his life he became a good general and an economic administrator of genius in his years as chief of the haitian state he gave it a wealth and prosperity unequaled before or since little is known of his early years he was born of slave parents in probably on kitts island in the caribbean the boy by turns was a mason sailor stable hand bartender waiter and billiard marker in an inn at cap haitien in his early twenties he had saved enough to buy his freedom haiti was then a french colony st domingue populated by whites and negroes the french revolution which broke out in created shattering emotions in haiti fear among the whites exultant hope among the slaves colored men who demanded the liberty equality fraternity promised by the revolution were publicly tortured and slain pierre toussaint toussaint loverture a yearold coachman and jean jacques dessalines a negros slave realized that haiti was ripe for revolt and determined to lead it they organized secret meetings of insurgents and collected arms in august of rioting mobs burned hundreds of plantations and sugar refineries and slaughtered thousands of white people the napoleonic wars which allied spain and england against france confused the haitian situation further toussaint joined the spanish forces on hispaniola the island made of haiti and the present dominican republic by he was chief of haiti and christophe was second only to him as an army general governor of cap francois province and a wealthy owner of a mansion how he attained such heights in a few years has not been revealed toussaint showed such unmistakable talents in repelling french spanish and british forces that he was called louverture the opener in france napoleon refused to acknowledge haitian independence and he sent an expedition of warships and soldiers to subdue the island he placed his brotherinlaw capt gen charles le clerc in command le clerc upon reaching haiti demanded submission which was refused the french force landed and found the earth scorched christophe himself put the torch to his own home and the rest of the city of cap francois then he and his followers took to the hills the french won battle after battle but their morale and health declined in the face of the elusive foe when le clerc announced that slavery would be restored thousands of haitians joined christophe realizing his error le clerc retracted declared slavery abolished and offered haiti independence under french supervision toussaint and christophe accepted the compromise christophe and dessalines were commissioned french generals in charge of haiti and toussaint retired to his plantation but sincerity was no part of the french scheme toussaint was kidnaped and sent to a paris dungeon where he died a year later from cold and neglect realizing that he had been hoodwinked christophe quietly resumed plans for rebellion yellow fever he noticed would defeat the french more decisively than his army could le clerc himself was one of the many frenchmen who died in the months of occupation and his remaining force withered and was driven to the sea in haitian independence was affirmed again dessalines ugly in appearance and temper headed the state he antagonized his subjects with his many mistresses his minuets and the harshness of his dictatorship after he was killed by a mob the leaders of haiti adopted a republican constitution and appointed christophe president chief governor and commander in chief of land and sea forces the haitian economy was in distress there was not even a national monetary system so christophe asked for and received more than gourdes on which he placed a value of a franc each with these he purchased the coffee crop sold it to foreign nations for gold and thus established a stable currency haitis basic coin is still called the gourde and is still valued at dessalines death was followed by a civil war alexandre petion part french and part negro a onetime general of toussaint led the rebellion which resulted in southern haitis becoming a separate state or republic christophe remained supreme in the north and assumed the title of king in emulating frederick the great of prussia he called his royal palace san souci without care for a man who couldnt read he had picked up a lot of general information with patience two of his educated officials taught him to write henri i that is all he ever could write an atheist himself henri established catholicism as the state religion and was crowned by a french priest who became the court chaplain he likewise set up a system of nobilityprinces dukes counts barons and knights among these noblemen were the count de lemonade and the duke de marmalade an elaborate court etiquette was decreed and if any of the peers came to court in slovenly attire or displayed uncouth manners he was likely to join the convict gang that for years labored upon christophes formidable citadel the monarch enforced a drastic labor code too all ablebodied men had to work from sunrise to sunset with an hour off for breakfast and two hours off at midday there were frequent mutters of slavery among the toilers but the land was cultivated effectively and haiti became wealthy not only in agriculture but in shipping and cotton manufacture from time to time the king of france or napoleonwhich ever was in powersought an alliance with haiti but henri replied in an insolent negative unlettered as he was henri realized the value of education established schools and imported teachers he also built a royal hospital and a rudimentary school of medicine directed by a scot dr duncan stewart who remained faithful to the end henri well realized that his monarchy would last only as long as his own strength and vigor although he had his son declared heir to the throne he shipped in gold coins to the bank of england where it was deposited in his wifes name in his last years he became increasingly harsh and eccentric he beat an officer whose uniform was wrinkled he noticed a farmer snoozing in the field and fired a cannon at him he who had been a billiard marker became a billiard addict his sole other recreation was an outgrowth of his boyhood masonry far into the night he toiled alone upon the citadels walls one day in he astounded his servants by saying that he was going to a nearby village to attend mass he entered the empty church knelt and collapsed dr stewart diagnosed it as a stroke which would prevent his ever walking again nonsense king henri replied im reviewing the army tomorrow the next day with the army at attention henri was carried to his steed he took a few steps and trying to mount collapsed to the muddy earth the army marched away shouting long live the king and when it was out of earshot shouted down with the king he knew the game was over he was taken back to his palace and fired a silver bullet into his head the rebels killed the crown prince but permitted henris widow and daughters to go to europe and enjoy their fortune haiti itself soon relapsed into its prechristophe languor and poverty the silver bullet has been a fascinating legend in the west indies ever since eugene oneill the american playwright learned of it in his travels and used it in one of his early plays the emperor jones in the play jones a onetime pullman porter becomes emperor of a tiny caribbean island and boasts that only a silver bullet can bring him down so the rebellious natives mold a silver bullet to end the emperors career a gallery of by william barrow the sounds one v hears from the direc tion of hollywood and the mai or tv net works can be believed negro actors are on the threshold of a breakthrough into realistic roles that is negroes will be presented in parts more in keeping with reality which is to say of course that they will be portrayed like other people this could lead to the establishment of negro actors as international matinee idols and the present success of at least three of these actors augurs well for this prospect harry belafonte for instance is already a romantic figure despite hollywoods nervous approach to his roles in films only in movies with allnegro casts have the movie moguls dared to exploit belafontes ample and obvious sex appeal the big expensive island in the sunwhich pussyfooted around the romance between belafonte and joan fontaine was a grand example of hollywoods timidity no virile handsome west indian male is likely to talk his way through a courtship with a beautiful woman whatever her color and the inference that one might was libel on that robust race of men the possibilities of belafonte as a lover are limitless and if the box office balks in dixie well there is all of europe and africa and asia to make up for it in recent years however belafonte has withdrawn from the movie scene leaving it pretty much to sidney poitier like belafonte poitier most often has appeared in romantic parts only in allnegro films or in strictly restricted situations in other films even in the highlyregarded lilies of the field his role is heroic without being romantic poitier however recently broke out of that bag by hiring himself out to moviemakers in europe in the long ships which was filmed in yugoslavia poitier portrays a dashing moorish sheik whose paramour is a lovely viking lady the history of the mediterranean world is rich in stories of the adventures of africans and europeans are not afraid to tell the stories following the precedent of belafonte who took a fling at producing his own movies odds against tomorrow sidney poitier has indicated that he has written a play which he may present on broadway in the near future the key role of course was tailored to his own individual talent europe which claimed actor gordon heath more than a decade ago and to which poitier temporarily escapes has been good to actor william marshall as well the indianaborn exile who found reasonably steady work in hollywood portraying various and sundry slaves has achieved enormous success on the continent particularly in shakespeares plays last summer he journeyed to spain and then on to africa to recreate the role of a missionary in the spanish film piedra de toque marshall had to share his shakespearean chores and laurels this year with another expatriate american actor earle hyman unlike marshall however hyman first found a niche among the shake earle henry hyman scott spearean actors at home during one season at stratfordonthehousatonic he had no less a leading lady than the great katherine hepburn hyman departed these shores early in for a tour of the european continent that began in norway echoes reverberating back across the atlantic indicated that his othello would have made the bard of avon proud hyman first gained recognition on broadway for the role which catapulted still another handsome young thespian into the hollywood spotlight that of the innocent young hero in anna lucasta henry scott graduated from such theater roles as brett in deep are the roots to the lead in the film version of anna lucasta and then finding no new roles dropped out of sight brock peters has been luckier during he appeared in two topbracket films to kill a mocking bird and the lshaped room and he also enjoyed a brief theatrical fling in the role of othello a singer of note as well as an excellent actor peters needs not worry too much about the dearth of feature roles for young negro actors concert and night club bookings are always available to him still it is as an actor that he would prefer to earn his spurs and as a romantic leading man he hasas his handling of the role of crown in porgy and bess proved all the qualifications as ripe material for romantic leading roles ossie davis emerged at just that moment when his star as playwright also was ascending davis like his gifted wife ruby dee had been around broadway for close to years making the best of whatever parts came his way not until he stepped into the a raisin in the sun role made famous by sidney poitier however did the public realize his romantic potential a few months later he was riding the crest of broadway stardom in purlie victorious his own satiric vehicle and even in purlies ramshackle environment and rustic language the actors glamor shone through perhaps now if the optimists are right the young actors now making a name for themselves in television and the theater will stand a genuine chance of making the grade as romantic leads there is a fine brace of candidateslonnie sattin ivan dixon and billy dee williams among them all three of these young men have scored heavily in the theatre sattin in body beautiful and the abortive kicks and company dixon in a raisin in the sun and williams in a taste of honey it remains to see whether theyand others like them will be able to slip through the breakthrough in the wall of racial prejudice coffee for the road by alex la guma hey were past the maizelands and driving through the wide low semidesert country that sprawled away on all sides in reddishbrown flats hey and depressions the land going south was scattered with scrub and thorn bushes like a vast unswept carpet far to the right the metal vanes of a windmill turned wearily in the faint morning breeze as if it had been wakened to set reluctantly about its duty of sucking water from the miserly earth the car hurtled along the asphalt road its tyres roaring along the black surface i please want another sandwich zaida said she sat hud died in a blanketed space among some suitcases in the back she was six years old and weaa y from the long speeding journey and her initial interest in the landscape had evaporated so that now she sagged tiredly in the padded space ignoring the parched gullies and stunted trees that whisked past theres some in the tin you can help yourself cant you the woman at the wheel said without taking her eyes off the road do you want to eat some more too ray not hungry any more the boy beside her replied he was gazing out at the barbedwire fence that streamed back outside the turnedup window how fars it to cape town mummy zaida asked munching a sandwich well be there tomorrow afternoon the woman said will papa be waiting of course theres some sheep the boy ray said a scattering of farm buildings went by drab dusty dominoshaped structures along a brown slope the mother had been driving all night and she was feeling fatigued her red eyes with the feeling of sand under the lids irritating the eyeballs they had stopped for a short while along the road the night before parked in a gap off the road outside a small town there had been nowhere to put up for the night the hotels were for whites only in fact only whites lived in these towns and everybody else except for the servants lived in the tumbledown mud houses in the locations beyond besides they did not know anybody in this part of the country dawn had brought depression gloom illtemper which she tried to control in the presence of the children after having parked on that stretch of road until after midnight she had started out again and driven the children asleep through the rest of the night now she had a bad headache too and when zaida said can i have a meatball mummy she snapped irritably oh dash it all its there eat it cant you the landscape ripped by like a film being run backwards redbrown yellowred pinkred all studded with sparse bushes and broken boulders to the east a huge outcrop of rock strata rose abruptly from the arid earth like a titanic wedge of purpleandlavender layered cake topped with chocolatecoloured boulders the car passed over a stretch of gravel road and the red dust boiled behind it like a flameshot smokescreen a bird its long ribbonlike tail streaming behind it skimmed the brush beyond the edge of the road flitting along as fast as the car look at that funny bird mummy the boy ray cried and pressed his face to the dustfilmed glass the mother ignored him trying to relax behind the wheel her feet moving unconsciously but skillfully on the pedals in the floor she thought that it would have been better to have taken a train but billy had written that hed need the car because he had a lot of contacts to visit she hoped the business would be better in the cape her head ached and she drove automatically she was determined to finish the journey as quickly as possible ray said i want some coffee and he reached for the thermos flask on the rack under the dashboard ray could take care of himself he did not need to have little things done for him give me some too zaida called from the back among the suitcases and grips dont be so greedy ray said to her eating eating eating im not greedy i want a drink of coffee you had coffee this morning i want some more greedy greedy children the mother said wearily children stop that arguing he started first zaida said stop it stop it her mother told her ray was unscrewing the cap of the thermos when it was off he drew the cork and looked in man there isnt any he said there isnt any more coffee well thats just too bad the mother said i want a drink zaida cried im thirsty i want some coffee the mother said wearily oh all right but youve got to wait well get some somewhere up the road but wait will you the sun was a coppery smear in the flat blue sky and the countryside scorched yellow and brown like an immense slice of toast quivered and danced in the haze the woman drove on tiredly her whole mind rattling like a stale nut behind the sunglasses her eyes were redrimmed and there was a stretched look about the dark handsome indian face her whole system felt taut and stretched like the wires of a harp but too tight so that a touch might snap any one of them the miles purred and growled and hummed past flat country and dustcoloured buttes the bakedclay gulches and low ridges of hills a shepherds hut lonely as a lost soul crouched against the shalecovered side of a flat hill now and then a car passed theirs headed in the opposite direction going north crashing by in a shrill wine of slipstream the glare of the sun quivered and quaked as if the air was boiling i want some coffee zaida repeated petulantly we didnt have no coffee well buy some coffee the mother told her well buy some for the road as soon as we get to a cafe stop it now eat another sandwich dont want sandwich want coffee a group of crumbling huts like scattered broken cubes passed them in a hollow near the road and a band of naked dusty brown children broke from the cover of a sheeppen dashing to the side of the road cheering and waving at the car ray waved back laughing and then they were out of sight the windscoured metal pylon of a waterpump drew up and then disappeared too three black men trudged in single file along the roadside looking ahead into some unknown future wrapped in tattered dusty blankets oblivious of the heat their heads shaded by the ruins of felt hats they did not waver as the car spun past them but walked with fixed purpose the car slowed for a steelslung bridge and they rumbled over the dry rockstrewn bed of a stream a few sheep their fleeces black with dust sniffed among the boulders watched over by a man like a scarecrow at a distance they passed the coloured location and then the african location hovels of clay and clapboard strewn like discoloured dice along a brown slope with tiny people and antlike dogs moving among them on another slope the name of the town was spelled out in whitewashed boulders the car passed the sheds of a railway siding with sheep milling in corrals then lurched over the crossing and bounced back onto the roadway a coloured man went by on a bicycle and they drove slowly past the nondescript brown front of the railway hotel a line of stores and beyond a burnt hedge a group of white men with red sunskinned windhoned faces sat drinking at tables in front of another hotel with an imitation dutchcolonial fagade there was other traffic parked along the dusty gravel street of the little town powdered cars and battered pickup trucks a wagon in front of a feed store an old coloured man swept the pavement in front of a shop his reed broom making a hissing sound like gas escaping in spurts two white youths pinkfaced and yellowhaired dressed in khaki shorts and shirts stared at the car their eyes suddenly hostile at the sight of a dark woman driving its shiny newness metal fittings factorysmooth under a film of road dust the car spun a little cloud behind it as it crept along the redgravel street whats the name of this place mummy the boy ray asked i dont know the mother replied tired but glad to be able to slow down just some place in the karroo whats that man doing zaida asked peering out through her window where ray asked looking about what man hes gone now the little girl said you didnt look quickly then will we get coffee now i think so the mother said you two behave yourselves and therell be coffee dont you want a cool drink no the boy said you just get thirsty again afterwards i want a lot of coffee with lots of sugar zaida said all right the mother said now stop talking such a lot up ahead at the end of a vacant lot stood a cafe tubular steel chairs and tables stood on the pavement outside in front of its shaded windows its front was decorated with old coca cola signs and painted menus a striped awning shaded the tables in the wall facing the vacant space was a footsquare hole where nonwhites were served and a group of ragged coloured and african people stood in the dust and tried to peer into it their heads together waiting with forced patience the mother drove the car up and brought it to a stop in front of the cafe inside a radio was playing and the slats of the venetian blinds in the windows were clean and dustless give me the flask the mother said and took the thermos bottle from the boy she unlatched the door now you children just sit quiet i wont be long she opened the door and slid out and standing for a moment on the pavement felt the exquisite relief of loosened muscles she stretched herself enjoying the almost sensual pleasure of her straightened body but her head still ached badly and that spoiled the momentary delight which she felt with the feeling gone her brain was tired again and the body once more a tightwound spring she straightened the creases out of the smart tan suit she was wearing but left the jacket unbuttoned then carrying the thermos flask she crossed the pavement walking between the plastic and steel furniture into the cafe inside the cafe was cool and lined with glass cases displaying cans and packages like specimens in some futuristic museum from somewhere at the back of the place came the sound and smell of potatoes being fried an electric fan buzzed on a shelf and two gleaming urns one of tea and the other for coffee steamed against the back wall the only other customer was a small white boy with towcoloured hair a face like a nearripe apple and a running nose he wore a washedout print shirt and khaki shorts and his dusty bare feet were yellowwhite and horny with cracked callous his pink sticky mouth explored the surface of a lollipop while he scanned the covers of a row of outdated magazines in a wire rack behind the glass counter and a trio of soda fountains a broad heavy woman in a green smock thumbed through a little stack of accounts ignoring the group of dark faces pressing around the square hole in the side wall she had a roundshouldered thick body and reddishcomplexioned face that looked as if it had been sandblasted into its component parts hard plains of cheeks with knobbly cheekbones and a bony ridge of nose that separated twin lakes of dull grc and the mouth a bitter gash cold and malevolent as a lizards a dry chapped and serrated pink crack she looked up and started to say something and then saw the colour of the other woman and for a moment the grey lakes of the eyes threatened to spill over as they gaped the thin pink mouth writhed like a worm in a puddle of milk as she sought for words can you fill this flask with coffee for me please the mother asked the crack opened and a screech came from it harsh as the sound of metal rubbed against stone coffee my lord jesus christ the voice screeched a bedamned coolie girl in here the eyes stared in horror at the brown tired handsome indian face with its smart sunglasses and the city cut of the tan suit coolies kaffirs and hottentots outside dont you bloodywell know and you talk english too hey the mother stared at her startled and then somewhere inside her something went off snapped like a tightwound spring suddenly loose jangling shrilly into action and she cried out with disgust as her arm came up and the thermos flask hurtled at the white woman bloody white trash she cried coolie yourself the flask spun through the air and before the woman behind the counter could ward it off it struck her forehead above an eyebrow bounced away tinkling as the thin glass inside the metal cover shattered and upset a stand of stale chewinggum the woman behind the counter screeched again and clapped a hand to the bleeding gash over her eye staggering back the little boy dropped his lollipop with a yelp and dashed out the dark faces at the hatch gaped the dark woman turned and stalked from the cafe in a rage she crossed the sidewalk her brown face taut with anger and opened the door of the car furiously the group of nonwhites from the hole in the wall around the side of the building came to the edge of the vacant lot and stared at her as she slammed the door of the car and started the motor she drove savagely away from the place her hands gripping the wheel tightly so that the knuckles showed yellow through the brown skin then she recovered herself and relaxed wearily slowing down feeling tired again through the anger she took her time out of town while the children gazed sensing that something was wrong then the boy ray asked isnt there any coffee mummy and wheres the flask no there isnt any cofile the mother replied well have to do without coffee im afraid i wanted coffee the little girl zaida complained you be good the mother said mummys tired and please stop chattering did you lose the flask ray asked keep quiet keep quiet the woman told him and they lapsed into silence they drove past the edge of the town past a dusty servicestation with its red pumps standing like sentinels before it two africans in overalls played draughts behind them past a man carrying a huge bundle of firewood on his head and past the last buildings of the little town a huddle of whitewashed cabins with chickenc scrabbling in the dooryard a sagging shearingshed with a pile of dirty tables of wool inside and a man hanging over a fence watching them go by the road speared once more into the redyellowbrown countryside and the last green trees dwindled away the sunlight danced and jiggled like a midday ghost across the expressionless earth and the tyres of the car rumbled faintly on the black asphalt there was some traffic ahead of them but the woman did not bother to try to overtake the boy broke the silence in the car by saying will papa take us for drives he will i know zaida said i like this car better than uncle ikes well he gave us lots of rides ray replied there goes one of those funny birds again mummy will we get some coffee later on zaida asked maybe dear well see the mother said the dry and dusty landscape continued to escape past the window on either side of the car up ahead the sparse traffic on the road was slowing down and the mother eased her foot on the accelerator look at that hill the boy ray cried it looks like a face is it a real face zaida asked peering out dont be silly ray answered how can it be a real face it just looks like one the car slowed down and the mother thrusting her head through her window peered forward past the car in front and saw the roadblock beyond it a small riotvan a landrover its windows and spotlight screened with thick wiremesh had been pulled up halfway across the road and a dusty automobile parked opposite it forming a barrier with just a carwide space between them a policeman in khaki shirt and trousers and flat cap leaned against the front fender of the automobile and held a stengun across his thighs another man in khaki sat at the wheel of the car and a third policeman stood by the gap directing the traffic through after examining the drivers the car ahead slowed down as it came up to the gap the driver signalling with his hand through his window he pulled up and the policeman looked at him stepped back and waved him on the car went through revved and rolled away the policeman turned towards the next car holding up a hand and the mother driving it felt the sudden pounding of her heart she braked and waited watching the khakiclad figure strolling the short distance towards her he had a young face with the usual redburned complexion of the land under the shiny leather bill of the cap he was smiling thinly but the smile did not reach his eyes which bore the hard qaulity of chips of granite he wore a holstered pistol at his waist and coming up he turned towards the others and called this looks like the one the man with the stengun straightened but did not come forward his companion inside the car looked across at the woman the policeman in the road said still smiling slightly ah we have been waiting for you you didnt think theyd phone ahead hey the children in the car sat dead still staring their eyes troubled the mother said looking out whats it all about never mind whats its all about the policeman said to her you know whats it all about he looked her over and nodded ja darkie girl with brown suit and sunglasses youre under arrest whats it all about the woman asked again her voice was not anxious but she was worried about the children never mind youll find out the policeman told her coldly one of those agitators making trouble here awright listen he peered at her with flinthard eyes you turn the car around and dont try any funny tricks hey our car will be in front and the van behind so watch out his voice was cold and threatening where are you taking us ive got to get my children to cape town i dont care about that he said you make trouble then you got to pay for it he looked back at the police car and waved a hand the driver of the police car started it up and backed and then turned into the road you follow that motorcar the policeman said were going back that way the woman said nothing but started her own car maneuvering it until they were behind the police car now you dont try any funny tricks the policeman said again she stared at him and her eyes were also cold now he went to the riottruck and climbed in the car in front of her put on speed and she swung behind it with the riottruck following where are we going mummy asked zaida are we going with those policemen ray asked you be quiet and behave yourselves the mother said driving after the police car the countryside redbrown and dusty moved past them the landscape they had passed earlier now slipping the other way the flat blue sky danced and wavered and the parched scrubstrewn scenery stretched away around them in the yellow glare of the sun i wish we had some coffee the little girl zaida said pointing aint polite by inez guienze hat with ole miss and birmingham in the news the subur ban housewife has become more sophisticated in her approach to race relations however this was not so a few years ago then the sole pursuit of many suburban housewives was providing the proper atmosphere for growth of a happy successful husband and welladjusted children it was of course important to the childs social future that he be wellmannered therefore no occasion was too slight to provide training in the social graces a typically wellgroomed poised suburban wife and her equally wellgroomed little boy boarded a suburban bus one day bb before birmingham they rode along peacefully with the child asking learned questions in his distinct fouryearold voice of course his diction was flawless quite to the surprise of the child a negro woman boarded the bus he stared at her intrigued then in his high pitched voice with lovely diction he said mommy mommy is that a nigger as he spoke he pointed excitedly to the negro woman the other passengers sensing the mothers embarrassment wondered how she would handle the childs faux pas ever so quickly so as to avoid a scene the mother red of face pulled the boys arm down gently she replied yes and dont point the color of law by joan brickman arrived home from the city to be told by our cook as i entered the kitchen door that simon our houseboy had left home at noon and had not returned thic mean only one thing he had been arrested by the police i immediately got back into my car and drove down to alexandra township a special area set aside for nonwhites to live in which lay four miles from our home on the main pretoria road which lead to the city of johannesburg i had often been into the township on missions similar to the one i was now engaged upon so i knew what lay ahead it was pm and the sun was just about ready to set which meant that within the half hour it would be dark a thought that did not make me very happy for the township at any time of the day was something to be avoided let alone in the evening when thousands of workers from the city were pouring into it fortunately the police station for which i was heading was not too far from the main road however the streets were unpaved slop water and heavy rains had eroded the surface and sides leaving deep ditches of three and four feet in place of gutters and huge ruts in the roadway this left very little room to drive a large american car i knew the chance i was taking if i inadvertently brushed one of the crowd or perhaps ran over a chicken a dangerous situation could arise and a possibility of even losing my lifeso great is the tension which exists today in south africa i drove carefully down the streets with bated breath trying to avoid the great big holes in the road the scrawny chickens emaciated dogs unkempt hungry children and the returning workers i had my revolver on the seat next to me in case of an emergency when brandishing it might have helped while the doors of the car were locked and the windows were closed i aroused considerable interest for not many whites driving alone entered the township especially women and at that time of the day some smiled with friendly eyes others were reluctant to give way as the car lurched drunkenly on the uneven road i arrived safe but slightly tense outside the police station where hundreds of africansmen women and childrenwere milling around outside on the street inside the grounds and in front of the charge office from the large crowd i knew that the police had had one of their intensive days of arrests as i said this was not a new experience i was continually on the hunt for some african male either from the factory where i worked or my own servants who had infringed one of the many laws which govern their lives but every time i entered a police station my heart twisted with pity as i gazed into the abject faces of those who had been taken prisoners and for those outside who had come to try and aid them since i was white they automatically made room for me some with sullen looks on their faces others with mere curiosity this was the time i felt ashamed of being white for without my white skin i would have had to take my turn which would have meant waiting for hours and then a hundredtoone chances are the waiting would in the end be in vain i entered the charge office through the entrance for whites and was not surprisedfor i had seen it oftento find a mass of humanity closely packed sitting on their haunches with hands clasped over their knees all over the floor a sea of black faces white eyeballs and tattered clothes there were about prisoners all male in a space where fifty would be crowded three african policemen stood at the counter and a white sergeant sat at a desk laughing as he held the phone to his ear i quickly glanced at the prisoners to see if simon was among them he was a big grin on his face for he had seen me as i entered the office his teeth shone white his black face glistened with perspiration my mtdem he said sotto voice those who heard him smiled and shared his happiness for a brief moment for a white person meant attention the paying of the fine and freedomuntil the next brush with the law the sergeant replaced the telephone onto the receiver yes madam he said in afrikaans i answered him in the same language saying i wanted to know why my servant had been arrested he could hear that i was not afrikaansspeaking so he asked me in english to point out the prisoner which i did he beckoned simon and shouted to him in afrikaans to come forward which was rather difficult owing to the very confined space in which simon had been sitting poor simon bewildered by trying to work out how he was going to get from where he was standing to the desk became more harrassed when the sergeant rasped in afrikaans for him to hurry having no alternative but to step on those in front of him he made his way to the desk they accepted being walked upon in silence for they knew the methods of the police by this time i was biting my tongue trying to avoid an argument for arguing with the police with regard to human feelings i had already found out was futile and usually made matters worse for me and the person i was trying to get released i could not however refrain from telling the sergeant that since the boy was from nyasaland he knew very little english and hardly any afrikaans for this info rmation i received a glare simon eventually stood in front of the sergeant the appropriate look of submission and humility on his round sweating facea look all africans have learned to use when dealing with the police if they fail to adopt this mien they are considered insolent and many times a swift working over by the guardians of the law will achieve this look which the police so much desire to see upon a blacks face meanwhile the sergeant was shuffling through masses of papers trying to find simons he located it looked at simon then looked at the charge sheet this boy is a foreign native he said yes i replied why was he arrested his papers are all in order well it seems madam he was picked up in the township why should he be arrested for that i asked mystified foreign natives are not allowed in the township it is against the law good grief i exploded surely there is not a law against that yes madam no foreign natives are allowed in the township and what is more he cannot sign an admission of guilt and pay a fine he must appear in front of the magistrate can i bail him out i queried oh yes but it is five pounds and he must appear in court tomorrow morning at ten oclock i took the five pounds from my purse and laid it upon the counter fuming at the thought of how much this represented to an african the majority of africans working on the land and in the homes were lucky if they received this amount as a monthly wage simon was fortunate for i had the money and would pay it for him but what of the hundreds who did not they were sent to prison usually to a farm jail where they would serve a grim threemonths sentence working for the white farm owner and on their release if they were originally sentenced because their pass book was not in order they were immediately picked up by the police and the whole cycle was repeated the sergeant asked an african policeman for the bail book in which to record the five pounds but was told that a certain policeman had locked itin the safe taken the keys with him and had gone off duty receiving this information with a bland look he turned to me and said he was sorry but he could not take the bail for he did not have the necessary release book i was dumfounded and asked if this meant that my servant had to spend the night in jail yes he answered quite unconcerned i am afraid there is nothing i can do the sergeant concerned lives eight miles away and i even think he has gone out for the evening he shrugged his shoulders he cook the keys by mistake there is nothing i can do keeping my voice level and trying to remain composed i asked what would happen others had the necessary fines or bail money nothing would happen theyll all have to spend the night in jail the book is locked up until eight oclock tomorrow morning he was not the slightest bit upset if my boy is allowed out on bail and i have the money i demand his release i shouted waving the five pound note under his nose just then a plainclothes detective entered the office and noticing i was upset he asked me what the trouble was i told him the story and ended up by saying with a great deal of feeling is there no justice at all in this country he was evidently senior to the sergeant for he told the sergeant that since i had offered the money for bail i was entitled to get the boys release furthermore since the african was employed by me they could in any case release him without bail on my responsibility providing i apeared the following morning in court at last i had simon on my side of the counter with nothing but the necessary promise to return the following morning the sergeant told one of the african constables to get simons bicycle which was recorded on the charge sheet and which he had been riding when arrested i then knowing the law asked what would happen to him if he rode the bicycle home it was already pitch dark and since he left the house at noon he had no light on the bicycle would he be arrested oh yes he answered it is against the law to ride without a light this meant a fourmile walk for simon pushing his bicycle i knew this would not interest the sergeant in the least so i refrained from making a remark now for the sixtyfour thousand dollar question i said with sarcasm since the police station is in the township and simon is a foreign african who is not allowed in is it possible that he can again be arrested on the same charge on his way out oh yes madam foreign na tives are not allowed in the township it is against the law then be so kind as to tell me how am i going to get him out i asked fit to burst i have no idea madam you must just hope that there are no police around he said very calmly by this time simons bicycle had been brought in and all i wanted to do now was to get out of the place for misery for those who had no help engulfed me looking at the bicycle i saw both tires had been deflated i asked why well we do this in case the boy tries to run away the detective said impatiently i looked at him in amazement all my life i had witnessed the arrest of africans but had never seen one run away who had actually been stopped perhaps if they saw the police in time and they were a good distance away they might make a dash for it but the south african police are wonderful marksmen and unless a man were really desperate most of them would never attempt to escape for fear of being shot i was disgusted and close to tears from utter frustration i asked for a pump so they could be reinflated sorry madam we do not have a pump was the sergeants reply as he turned to his desk a note of finality in his voice i had now spent one hour and fifteen minutes trying to obtain my servants release miserable and full of hate for those who allowed this to go on i told simon that we would try and get the bicycle into the car the trunk of the car was filled with suitcases and we managed eventually by leaving the one door open a few inches to squeeze the bicycle into the back it was necessary for simon to kneel on the front seat and hold the back door to keep it from flying open for we had no rope with which to tie it thus we traveled the four miles home on the way i asked simon why he went into the township no medem he replied me not in township when they catch me me going into township to by musick record but me not get there yet where did they arrest you then i asked outside medem on pretoria road they come ask for pass then tells me i must go police station did you ask them why i asked knowing full well that an african never asks a policeman why oh no medem the policie big skelms when you ask why i know my medem would come the next morning full of indignation for i had had the whole evening to brood on what had taken place simon and i set out for the alexandra police station arriving at the building that served as court which was close to the police station we joined the throng of milling people i made inquiries as to seeing the magistrate prior to his going into court and was told which office to enter we found a niche and stood watching the crowd there were at least three hundred africans standing around apart from the police and the officials i was the only white person young and old male and female stood in groups or singly all intent on trying to help or hear the worst the prisoners were hustled out from a wire cage which surrounded a small corrugated iron building large enough to hold perhaps thirty people with comfort i counted one hundred and twenty persons coming through the gates the bystanders as they recognized their friend or relative shouted in their own language causing quite a din the magistrate entered the office i told simon to remain where he was knocked at the door and was told to enter he was sitting at a desk reading a document which he duly completed before looking up to see who had entered i told him what had occurred the previous evening at the police station what he thought i do not know for he made no comments i then told him that my servant had intended going into the township but had not reached it when arrested thats his word against the police the magistrate stated in a terse voice i realize that does not count very much i said i am however inclined to believe my servants account of what had actually taken place to that of the police thats your prerogative i must go along with the police he stated flatly i then asked him how foreign africans were to know that it was forbidden them to enter the township were there notices put up in their language telling them of the law no he replied nothing is put up to inform them they usually find out the hard way i asked him if he thought this was justno warning given fining them more than a months wages for committing a crime they were not aware of that is not for me to say i am here to enforce the law and that is all i am concerned with trying to find out what else was against the law so that i could at least warn my servants i asked what was the ruling concerning the bus depot for this fell in the boundary of the township and all the buses terminated and ror menced their routes from there it is out of bounds for all foreign natives he replied in an irritated voice not to be discouraged i asked if my servant catches a bus at our home to go into johannesburg what must he do to be within the law to be able to complete his journey all the buses turned into the township without stopping the last official stop being half a mile up the road well he replied i would say he can jump off the bus as it turns into the township and walk up to the next stop wait for it to come out and then continue is it not against the law to jump off a moving vehicle i asked in a sweet voice oh yes but that is the chance he must take was the enlightening answer or else walk a mile in other words i said whatever they do they are wrong including riding on a road outside of the township and being arrested for being inside of the township and being arrested for being inside of it and is that justice madam that is your boys story but to give him the benefit of the doubt let this serve as a warning to him and i will not prosecute in this instance he may go i thanked him and left the office stepping into the hot sun my vision blurred with tears at the thought of all those as innocent as simon who had no white person to help them some were real offenders but most were mainly infringers of the cursed pass laws the fines that were levied against them were way out of proportion to the pittance they earned as wages in many instances they were unable to pay and were then sentenced to three months imprisonment most of them ending up on the farm prisons this is an official means of forced labour to help the farmers who because of the low wages and other unattractive working conditions which they offer are unable to get help the last government statistics available for africans arrested for infringing the pass laws has just been published for the year over three hundred and seventyfive thousand africans were arrested that year for contravention of the pass laws over a thousand per day these are not criminals merely unfortunate human beings with black skins who have wittingly or unwittingly not complied with the south african laws governing the black people the fighting fiftyfourth by joseph r rosenberger negro soldiers of i the unions th j j massachusetts stared across charleston harbor at the church spires painted against a sunstreaked dusk federal bombardment had begun early that morning and clouds of smoke still hung overhead the air smelled of gunpowder and death foretold of violence and mans inhumanity to man the soldiers watched the parapets of fort wagner less than a mile away from where they lay hidden the union command considered charleston one of the prized targets of the confederacy and having massed troops were determined to seize the city which was a provoking symbol to the north the citys southern aristocracy was inordinately proud of setting off the rebellion and firing the first shots of the civil war but this was not the only reason the city had to be stormed it had further strategic assets as a major port through which confederate armies were supplied from abroad fort sumter the federal bastion captured by south carolina troops at the start of the great and bloody conflict was the key to the harbor but maj gen quincy gillmore the union commander urgently needed fort wagner before he could blast sumter into submission the men of the th joked and laughed trying hard not to think of what lay ahead still there were little knots of fear in each man tension is normal with even experienced battlehardened troops but these men had never seen battle before not to any great extent having engaged in only one skirmish on nearby james island a few days before and here they werewould soon be called to take at bayonet point the strongest single earthwork ever constructed the men knew they were marked on james the confederates had swarmed upon them screaming with hate black flag no quarter no quarter the fanatic southerners had taken no prisoners from the regiment then nor would they willingly do so tonight for the th massachusetts was then the most controversial regiment on the face of the earth while its officers had been handpicked from prominent new england families its noncommissioned officers and men were negroes the first free negroes authorized by the war department each soldier lost in his own thoughts knew he would have to face more than confederate bullets he would also have to face deep and unreasonable resentment he was already facing that the southern papers were calling them apethings jeering that they will run like frightened black sheep at the first sight of their former masters nor was it much different in the north where many a negro had been senselessly attacked after leaving the recruiting station in fact the prejudice against the negro troops was so strong in many parts of the north that they had to be smuggled to the train one at a time to forestall future attacks little wonder that angels laugh at man nevertheless out of the jeers and insults out of the brutality and laughter had come an intense pride in the regiment and in the grim challenge they faced sgtmaj lewis douglas son of the frederick douglass who hac escaped from slavery to became the most prominent negro abolitionist and publisher remembered the words his father had printed men of color to arms who would be free must themselves strike the blow and their own colonel the decorated robert gould shaw called the th as good a regiment as any that has marched now colonel shaw walked among his men on the beach his trim figure outlined against the sand dunes he seemed young almost boyish despite the lines in his face and his stiff blond mustache his troops snapped to rigid attention as he approached but puffing on a cigar he motioned them to rest for two days they had had little sleep had eaten and drunk less and every moment of rest was precious the men had an intense devotion for shaw and many followed him with calls of good luck sir only years old and a few years out of harvard shaw was already a battlehardened officer he had been severely wounded at antietam and had barely escaped death at winchester when a bullet struck his watch brig gen george c strong the ths brigade commander suddenly galloped up to the men it was he who had personally led the landings on morris island the week before he stood there now resplendent in full uniform the men rose to attention their sharp bayonets glistening in the last rays of the evening sun shaw and strong exchanged salutes strong spoke first you may lead the column if you want your men are worn out i know but you can do as you choose shaw could have refused with honor his men were exhausted and there would have been no taint had he declined the offer and placed the th in a supporting position for the attack his men crowded around shaw as he answered quietly i and my men will lead the advance sir and well carry the flag with us a thunderous cheer rang out from his men all along the line the men would fight how well would they fight that was a question still to be answered only two months before on may boston had prepared a thunderous welcome for the th with crowds swarming around the common filling every sidewalk balcony and window along the route of march it seemed that half of massachusetts had packed itself into the heart of the city about in the morning the watchers at the flagdraped corner of park square and boylston street heard the first rousing strains of the john brown song a few moments later the long blue column of soldiers with shaw at its head swung down the street boots beating against the pavement in perfect cadence new enfield muskets at rigid rightshoulder symmetry william lloyd garrison the nations most outspoken abolitionist for years watched the parade with tears rolling down his cheeks at the state house gov john a andrew and officials from all new england proudly greeted the regiment senator henry wilson said in his speech i do not know when in all human history to any given men in arms has been committed so proud a work so precious so full of hope and glory as the work committed to you fate must have smiled at these strong words for no one could laugh away or deny the dangers facing these colored soldiers the confederate government had already announced that any captured white officers of the th would be shot on the spot as for a negro soldier if he somehow escaped being instantly butchered he would be sold into the living death of slavery further complicating the matter were political obstacles equally as severe as southern ruthlessness and brutality even president lincoln feared for a formation of a negro regiment would stir violent resentment among the border states while many war department officials considered the negro troops worthless the peace democrats of the north would have none of it declared the boston pilot in bold type they are as fit to be soldiers of this country as their abettors are to be its statesmen maintained many union officers why one southern regiment of white men could whip regiments of niggers in an hour only after lincoln had issued the emancipation proclamation on jan would he approve the formation of the th needless to say the eyes of the entire nationif not the worldwere on these men and for good reason there was a severe shortage of soldiermaterial of manpower in the north but there still remained the northern negroes the very last untapped source if the th could prove itself under the bloody baptism of southern fire the president would then recruit at least new colored regiments the formation of the new regiment began governor john andrew who had championed the cause for the negro regiment chose shaw for one good reason the shaw family hated the southern system fervent abolitionists the shaws were almost the first people of wealth to make known their views against slavery shaw went at once to boston to launch a recruiting drive while frederick douglass led the movement in new york city his two sons lewis and charles were the first recruits come may th and the quota of the th was filled not only that but there were enough volunteers to form the nucleus of a second negro regiment the th this was not because of low recruiting standards quite the contrary shaws standards were high of negroes from new bedford for instance only two could not read or write a record few white northern regiments could equal proudly shaw wrote his bridetobe the mustering officer tells me that he has never seen so fine a set of men though about have passed through his hands since september an intense training period began secretary of war edwin stanton ordered the th to join general gillmores forces in the southern command but there was trouble ahead and shaw could see the signs antinegro copperhead factions demanding immediate peace with the south thundered that well kill ever damned nigger we gets our hands on and that includes the white trash that leads them shaw had planned to send the th to new york by train but later had his men moved south by ship after being warned by new yorks police commissioner that he could not be responsible for the regiments safety even riots threatened in boston in spite of that citys jubilant reception of may shaw wisely ordered his rear guard to march through the city with fixed bayonets two hundred reserve policemen were held in readiness around the common but the vindictive antinegro factions made known their resentment in a more subtle manner residents pulled down their shades to hide the sight of colored troops the exclusive somerset club locked its doors and blacked out its windows on june rd the troops of the th landed at hilton head south carolina part of the complex chain of coastal islands already held by union troops at once shaw had them parade through the dusty streets of hilton head their bayonets set their boots and leather highly polished other troopswhite troopsrushed to the streets in disbelief their mouths open in awe as the long blue column with drums beating and banners flying marched and wheeled in perfect precision soon the streets were lined with cheering spectators shaw was proud of his troops and they were proud of themselves and of him general gillmore planned a twopronged attack on charleston while brig gen a h terry made a diversionary strike at nearby james island gillmore landed pieces of artillery parrott guns and siege mortars at one end of morris at the southern rim of the harbor by july gillmore had gotten his artillery within yards of fort wagner before the confederate counterattack stalled his plans two days before shaw had been ordered to take his men by boat to join general terry on james so on july men of the th stood picket duty with the th connecticut regiment confederate general p g t beauregard who commanded the charleston area decided to do something about it reinforcements were rushed from other forts and the southerners struck that morning with five regiments supported by cavalry and artillery the th connecticut was quickly thrown back by the savage confederate attack not so with the th supporting it for over three hours the negro troops stood fast refusing to retreat as much as one inch one soldier later wrote to his mother the bullets were so thick that i could actually feel the wind of them it was a miracle that i wasnt killed the ths stiff stand and resistance gave the th connecticut time to pull back and reorganize wrote a war correspondent had the th given way had they fallen back the retreat of the th would have been cut off and they would have been completely annihilated later representatives of the th visited the ths bivouac to thank them and general terry sent shaw his personal commendation there was no time for celebrating however gillmore ordered terrys force from james to morris island for the major assault on fort wagner shaw had to march his men all night through a blinding rainstorm to cover the length of the island thunder rolled and jagged lightning knifed down from the angr heavens marching along a narrow path through swamps and underbrush the men had to march single file each man often holding the belt of the man in front branches clawed their faces and mud weighed their boots it took the regiment seven hours to cover the four miles to the embarkation point they fell to the ground exhausted that morning the th was carried by boat to morris island there was little doubt that soon in a matter of hours the negro soldiers would face their real baptism of fire shaw led his men on the final sixmile march up the sandy island to the front reaching their positions just before pm other regiments having heard about the ths stand on james cheered wildly as the colored troops passed am it was hot and the sky was cloudless general gillmore ordered the union guns to open fire on fort wagner it was one of the epic bombardments of the war as the fort was blasted with over pieces for six hours brig gen william b taliaferro later estimated that almost shells had been fired against his positions wagner was a strong fort built of palmettolog revetments with bombproofs holding a deep moat protected its doublebastioned face there was only one approacha sandy spit narrowing just before the fort to only a few hundred feet huge naval guns and howitzers covered this approach pound cannon and howitzers provided the flanking fire from two salients further firepower could be provided from confederate batteries on sumter james and sullivan islands even if the union troops reached the fort through the blistering fire they would still have to fight their way up a foot slope against a select corps of infantry and artillerymen for hours union shells tore great furrows in wagners embankment now and then confederate guns returned the fire by four oclock they no longer answered and general gillmore half convinced himself that the confederate artillery had been knocked out of action confederate general taliaferro was no fool actually he had sandbagged most of his guns from the very start of the union bombardment with the result that not one of his weapons had been as much as scratched his men tuckea in the bombproofs had suffered few casualties this was just one of the many union miscalculations now the wily aliaferro brought his cannon back into position gillmore delayed his assault until dusk giving beauregard a few hours to rush reinforcements from the mainlandanother union mistake gillmore had planned the attack carefully having organized his force of men into three brigades at pm the th took its position at the head of the column with regiments from connecticut new york maine and new hampshire behind it shaw rode down the line and in a ringing voice told his troops the future of the negro soldier will be decided this night with gods help well plant the flag on wagners ramparts the attack was ready to be launched but the union command had fumbled badly no plan of the fort or terrain was ever shown the regimental commanders it is doubtful if the high command ever knew about the sandy spit they would have to cross would be virtually cut in half by the tide one officer col h s putnum suspicious of the whole business was to remark we are going to be slaughtered like innocent sheep pm darkness was very close the western sun burned but very faintly and a heavy fog was drifting in from the silent sea distant thunder rolled across the horizon pm shaw ordered the th to attention he then reminded them that the confederate government had threatened to kill all captured negro troops men he said simply you will either have to take the fort or die there he drew his sword and his officers shook hands then shaws sword flashed downward the negro troops of the th massachusetts swarmed across the sand the march into hell had begun a march that would make negro history the men moved at quicktime at first then shaw shouted for doublequick not wanting to take any chances there was not sound no shot from the fort the men reached a point about yards from the fort where the water cut the sandy spit in half confusion now became the order of the day men were forced into the sea to their knees officers struggled to maintain formation but platoons and companies were hopelessly mingled together they struggled on toward the fort they were only yards from the fort when wagners guns cut loose cutting the front lines to bloody pieces the regiment wavered for a small moment seemed to stop shaw plunged forward shouting onward onward the lines came to life and followed him the men of the proud th moved forward running now stumbling into holes made by cannon balls falling over tangled masses of their own dead hail after hail of grape and cannister shot poured into their lines and musket fire chopped down the attacking figures few troops had ever stood against such concentrated artillery fire in such a confined space death grinned fiendishly and black men were blown into eternity still they kept coming as shaw screamed charge but the confederates had more in store for the brave men of the th reb batteries on sumter sullivan and james islands now opened up with a terrible crossfire ripping the rear of the regiment to shreds and pinning down the regiments behind so that the colored soldiers were virtually isolated yet they continued to move toward death forty yards from the fort they ran into the moat in which water was four feet deep many of the men were caught and dropped by rifle fire from the ramparts others drowned the advance wave started up the dangerous slope of the parapet and from the top the st north carolina regiment fired down on them the charlestown battalion blasted them from the right salient the men of the th began going up the hellslope howitzers blew them into nothingness grenades knocked them back into the moat they did not retreat on and on they came determined not to retreat shaw and thirty of his men reached the top in a few minutes they fought in a circle with knives and bayonets as maddened southern infantry met them with musketbutts handspikes and gunrammers but the ths regimental flag had been planted on the slope the man carrying the national flag reached the top and was killed but sgt william carney caught the flag before it fell he managed to hold the flag aloft for minutes before he was riddled with minnie balls four union officers crawled into an embrasure of the right salient killing the gun crew with their revolvers three other officers two of whom were killed a few seconds later even reached the left bastion of the inner fort the men at the fort could still hear shaw crying attack attack through the fire and smoke they could still see his sword slashing at the grayclad confederates surrounding him then he fell riddled with shot as his troops fought like demons around his body only to fall later around his lifeless form what was left of the th clung desperately to the slope sweeping the crest with their muskets victory was still possible at this point but the supporting regiments failed to follow through several regiments close behind the th could have taken the fort but instead only small units from the connecticut and new york reached the parapet and fought only briefly in one salient the rest of the brigade lay pinned down in front of the moat the momentum had been lost and only havoc and confusion remained on that thin strip of sand the dead and the wounded lay as one piled together in a ditch sometimes in a heap strewn all over the place for threequarters of a mile of members of the th in the attack almost half were killed wounded or missing the total union losses exceeded men of eleven regimental commanders eight had been killed or wounded colonel shaws body was stripped of its uniform and his personal belongings stolen by southern soldiers general gillmore requested that the body be returned for a military funeral and was told by a confederate officer we buried him with his niggers confed erate gen johnson hagood told a captured union officer i would have given him an honorable burial had he been in command of white troops but since he wanted to lead nigger troops i had him buried with them in the common trench he led animals and i buried him with animals this scornful message was widely circulated in the north and newspapers screamed for revenge against southern sadism the plight of captured negro troops immediately became a very explosive issue south carolina demanded that five captured members of the th be turned over to the state by the military for trial under local slavery laws the men would either be shot or sold into slavery the north demanded action and action it got when president lincoln announced that a confederate soldier would be shot in retaliation for every u s soldier executed in violation of the war code lincolns stem announcement stopped the south and captured negroes as well as their white officers were consequently transferred to military stockades fort wagner became a national symbol said president lincoln it is a grave which will be sacred for all time to come proclaimed the new york tribune fort wagner has done for the colored race what bunker hill has for years done for white yankees the battle for fort wagner had done more it proved to even the most dogmatic and bigoted of critics that negro troops could more than hold their own against the cream of the confederacy wagner was not finally captured until sept th but the brilliant record of the th persuaded the administration to speed up negro recruitment in the next months more than negroes were enlisted in the army of this amount would eventually be killed wounded or missing almost enlisted in the navy which had never had discrimination the negroes of our own times can be proud of the th massachusetts regiment yet there is a terrible sadness and a deep shame about all this which cannot be denied or ignored a sadness that perhaps still clings to the silent ghosts of those negroes who died at fort wagner fighting for freedom to those dark men who died in the spanish american war in world war i and world war ii a sadness and bitterness because while they fought and fought well and died wellthey still must see their living brothers held down as secondclass citizens under the very flag which is the world symbol for freedom the flag under which these silent ghosts once lived the very flag for which they died the deep shame should be felt by all men who would deny freedom and equality to others to those descendants of the men of the th massachusetts who so many many years ago fought and died and wrote negro history with their very blood
wht e supremacya dead ly disease by howard seals white supremacy is irrational in a manner and degree constituting mental illness white supremacy in practice constitutes psychotic behavior it is a mass delusion it is an ethnic psychosis fixed on the delusive veneer of skincolor and it is axiomatic in the curing of mental illness that cure can only be effected in those cases where the patient wants to get well the social psychosis of white supremacy is not a negro problem but a problem of distortions in the minds of white t people negroes at best involvement can only aggravate the social consciences of white people into an awareness and confrontation with the illness of white supremacy negroes themselves can never solve the race problem simply because they do not cause the problem negroes do not formulate the bases for the practice of racial discrimination nor do they continue and perpetuate the practices of racial supremacy it is not the negros problem but the problem of white people it is white people who must confront and solve the problem negroes can only perform the incidental tasks of helping white people to recognize the problem the final solution must come from whites alone so long as white people fail or refuse to recognize the problem any gains achieved by the negro minority will only be temporary and will eventually be lost in a relapse to former conditions of racial oppression some form of the irrationalities inherent in the separate but equal delusion continues to dement white people as it has for centuries despite the supreme court decree which held separate but equal to be inherently unequal in earlier times this delusion was articulated as the white mans burden in which an enlightened divinely favored white people undertook the burden of leading their savage and pagen black brothers to divine salvation it was held that these accursed people were to be enslaved for their own betterment the slave uprisings insurrections and the civil war debunked the presumptions of the white mans burden and so it was rephrased as separate but equal separate but equal was codified by the united states supreme court in in the case of plessy v ferguson and was finally overturned years later in the supreme court decision today separate but equal has been recast in what seems best summarized as the concept lead your people it is tragically ironic that todays recasting of separate but equal was presaged in justice harlans dissent from the majority opinion in the aforementioned case of plessy v ferguson it is significant that while justice harlan appeared to be exceptionally liberal courageous and egalitarian in his dissenting opinion yet in the context of the very same dissenting opinion he affirmed his belief in race pride in this dissent he wrote every true man has pride of race and under appropriate circumstances when the rights of others his equals before the law are not to be affected it is his privilege to express such pride and to take such action based upon it as to him seems proper mr justice harlan while appearing to be just was merely rephrasing separate but equal what he failed to understand is that any pride which is based on qualities thought to be inherent in one race necessarily implies an inferior inheritance in other races today the race pride which justice harlan affirmed as valid is now devolving into the delusive attitude of lead your race it is now contended by the most liberal and apparently responsible white people that great progress has been made that vast opportunities have opened up for negroes and that it is now only a matter for negroes to lead and prepare their people to fill the positions of opportunity it has been the speciously proud boast of white liberals to cite the example of a ralph bunche a carl rowan or a james b parsons as proof of what a prepared negro can achieve but in actual truth the preparedness of ralph bunche should have caused him to be elected president of the united states carl rowan should have become a senator from his home state of tennessee james b parsons is sorely needed as governor of the state of illinois neither of these men has the slightest chance of attaining a position comparable to his merits essentially a negro must still as it were train himself for the position of officemanager in order to someday work up to the job of officeboy the slow progress in solving the problems of racial oppression has been compared to a brick wall that is being taken down brick by brick this analogy is also apt in illustrating the insidious and recidivistic import of gradualism for while one white hand is showily removing one brick from the wall of segregation the other hand is clandes tinely putting up another brick and because this new obstruction is clandestinely placed in effect it is two bricksit must first be detected and established as existing before the task of its removal can begin this is the insidious duplicity of gradualism if an everincreasing series of obstructions are to be placed in the negros path to equality then it is intended that racial equality will never be attained after struggling year after year some negroes have gotten fair employment practice acts passed by their state legislatures only to discover subsequently that these fep laws were being circumvented by the subterfuge of using coded symbols on employment applications restrictive covenants in housing were once quite blatantly explicit but now that legislation has made such restrictions punishable by law the restrictive covenant is implied in legal catchphrases or not stated at all in the gentlemans agreement negro parents have fought long and diligently to have their children integrated into other schools to escape the overcrowded schools in allnegro neighborhoods only to find that the whites move out of the school district to cause what has been termed resegregation if the path to equality is to be an infinite series of obstacles then it is futile for negroes to attempt to surmount them all it is then futile to hope for and place trust in the good faith and cooperation of white people negroes can then only place hope and trust in themselves apart from and distrustful of white people accumulating evidences of perpetual deceit by white people will force negroes into concluding that they cannot succeed in appealing to the conscience of the white man and the nonviolent resistance which has heretofore been characteristic of negroes will have to be abandoned moreover negroes must then give greater emphasis to the fact that their aims must not be limited to gaining equal opportunity with whites because white people are quite inhuman to other whites to be treated equally with whites would still entail an unbearable amount of oppression of the human spirit white people must come to realize how deeply racism has distorted and continues to distort for them the totality of human life in experiences of earliest childhood in things of apparently trivial significance and extending to matters of universal significance the distortions of racism are present throughout the entire range of experience for a white person it pervades nursery stories such as little black sambo or brer rabbit and the tarbaby racism is to be noted in the ideas that a white dress worn by a woman denotes purity while black dress denotes sexiness or immorality angelfood cakes are whitedevilfood cakes are chocolate colored in television commercials washing powders are not to produce cleanliness in clothing it is whiteness that is to be desired and white shoepolish does not take off scuff marks but put on the white while it takes off the black at the other extreme is the distortion of trying to fit the very dignity of god into a white skin myths of christianity imply that god was so pure in his whiteness that he immaculately fathered a son by a virgin white woman it is undeniable evidence of racial madness that in order to give a racial morphism to the supreme being white men would contradict his perfection by imputed acts of fornication and bastardy but these are the unembellished circumstances of the myth no matter how immaculate god was not married to the virgin mary and christ was left to be supported by a foster father joseph to state such a view concerning christianity may be regarded as abominable but the abomination is to be charged to the racial obsession which imputes such shame to god in the crises of school integration in the state of louisiana white mothers turned out en masse with their babies in their arms to spit out epithets and literally spit at the negro children it is a tragic paradox that such mothers were expressing their fears that their children would somehow be scarred or defiled by attending school with negro children poignantly the small white children terrorstricken whimpering in their mothers arms gave testimony that these mothers were themselves scarring the souls of their own children in a way that no child of any kind could do to another child only the involutions of psychic derangement could make a mothers breast so blind to the pain in a child pressed so closely to it much of the rightwing conservative movement or superpatriotism of today is covert racial fanaticism while purporting to be concerned with fighting communism they seek to impeach chief justice earl warren ostensibly for his part in decisions overturning several convictions of communists they would have it appear incidental that earl warren was also chief justice in the supreme court school desegregation decisions of the rightwingers purported to be champions of liberty for moise tshombe in the congo condemning the united nations allegedly for intrusion into the internal affairs of the congo they would have it appear that their condemnation had nothing to do with the united nations having thwarted the conspiracy of white industrialists in the congo that much of archconservatism is actually racial conspiracy in disguise is clearly illustrated by the recently provided record of one such superpatriot namely edwin a walker former general edwin walker was the commander of the federal troops which forcefully brought about integration of schools in little rock arkansas as a white southerner from texas walker seems to have regarded his role in arkansas as a betrayal of his race and when reassigned to a command in germany he sought to atone for this betrayal by becoming a superpatriot after resigning from the army walker embarked on a course of demagoguery which culminated in his activities in oxford there in mississippi he indicated what was troubling him so sorely in his own words i was on the wrong side in arkansas i am on the right side in mississippi the psychotic distortions of racism are resulting in a kind of irresponsible behavior which is critically effecting the ability of this nation to endure the very heart of democracy the exercise of individual liberty is being made into a mockery by the dissemblances of racial conspiracy the dixiecrats in the united states senate have through the filibuster made the right of unlimited debate become an unworkable legislative system and if the right of unlimited debate is to be discarded then democracy will not survive long after rabid southernersgovernors mayors and police chiefs have wilfully and repeatedly violated the law of the land and have said outright to hell with the constitution such treasonable attitudes and insurrective actions are a much clearer and much longer present danger to the overthrow of this government than the threat of any foreign power racism is pervading and becoming compounded in all facets of american life the socalled northern liberals are concocting all manner of legalistic labyrinths and parliamentary chicanery to stymie or fritter away racial progress northern newspapers handle news concerning negroes in a manner that is inflammatory dishonest and shockingly jingoistic they often use the news of the racial troubles in the south to obscure the racial treacheries perpetrated in their own states white liberal writers have published volume after volume on the civil war in the specious attempt to make the confederacy and robert e lee into legends of national glory and heroism only a psychosis focused on racism could attempt to invert such dishonor and shame into legends of national glory and pride to point up and dramatize the national shame and dishonor caused by racial bigotry negroes have suffered arrests beatings firehoses police dogs bombings arson shootings lynchings and murder the great courage forbearance and resolution of negroes has clearly shown that it is not among the minds of negroes that the blind wild hatreds of racism are produced they have clearly shown that it is among the minds of whites that the fears blind hatreds and distorted humanity of racism are produced even the black muslims could not come close to such madness though they have attempted to emulate white supremacy negroes cannot allay or explain away the hatreds and fears of white people only white people themselves can expunge from their minds the irrationalities which so severely distort their lives the groups which can be most easily infiltrated and incited to violence in this nation are groups of rabid racists a foreign enemy of this nation needs only have a white skin and words of racehate to win immediate and complete acceptance into the ranks of the racist mobs the most blindly irrational and the most obsessively irresponsible group of people threatening this nation are the white americans who in order to maintain racial tyranny will shout to hell with the constitution this nation was founded on the belief that all humans are created equal and this belief must not be violated or compromised lest the nation lose its foundations and to limit human worth to the superficial bounds of skincolor does not define a superior kind of humanity it defines something quite the opposite the behavior fomented by racism reduces humans to packs of wolves and never results in respect for the individual liberty necessary for democratic life keeping the record straig by john a morsell the fundamental appeal in my review of lomaxs book the negro revolt was for adherence to simple canons of truthfulness and accuracy in reporting the negro revolt erred grievously and profusely in this regard and my review took sharp note of a number of serious misstatements and distortions it also noted a number of what i called unnecessary if minor errata which i attributed to editorial laxity on the part of the publishers i agree with lomax that his business is writing books not editing them and my reference to these errors made this plain i must add however that most authors whom i know cannot forbear a final peep at the galleyproofs in the expectation that some mistakes may have slipped in and in the hope that what comes out over their names will be as near perfect as possible lomax is quite mistaken incidentally in assuming that i was assigned to write that review i had an advance copy of the book and was thus the first person on our staff to read it it appalled and outraged me and i wrote the review on my own the review has evidently appalled and outraged lomax but his reaction would be more soundly based if he showed any sign of having read it with care he misquotes a reference to himself for example as a selfasserted naacp board member but this is not what i wrote the actual text was selfassertedly an active member and its purpose was to express surprise that under those circumstances he should be so ignorant of what the naacp does i am no longer so charitable however i think lomax does know but that for reasons of his own he prefers to ignore it lomaxs account of the naacps participation in the southern regional councils voter education project is typically garbled it was expected and desired that the association having the most experience in voter registration work should contribute heavily to the design and structure of the project to this end a careful evaluation of the prospectus was made by several of our staff executives and many of the suggestions they offered were subsequently incorporated into the vep plan no final commitment could be made except by vote of our board of directors the plan was not far enough advanced to permit this at the april policy meeting and it was therefore considered at the next policy meeting in september there was no delay intentional or otherwise and lomaxs fictitious quotation from an unidentified board member is gratuitous incidentally lomax professed at the time to believe that huge sums of money were instantly at hand and were being kept out of useful circulation only by naacp procrastination he was also wrong as to the amounts involved they were less than he claimed but being in honor bound by the sponsors to refrain from any public comment we could not speak freely about this or other aspects the sponsors be it noted were perturbed as we were over lomaxs premature radio broadcast which they regarded as mischievous and irresponsible in point of fact it took from september until march to obtain a ruling from the treasury department which would permit the vep funds to be channeled to the naacp and others who do not enjoy the right to receive taxexempt money it would be unfortunate in the extreme if criticism of the naacp were frightened off as lomax suggests continuous criticism is important one would hope it could be constructive even from lomax but any kind is better than none at all at the same time it seems to me the critics should adopt the same attitude and be prepared for countercriticism for correction and for refutation where these are in order this is the essence of healthy debate and it is not helped when giveandtake is interpreted as invidious personal attack a thick skin is still an important requirement for those who would be involved in controversy are negroes pushing too fast by john h marion ecalling her days r y as a canteen director in world war ii margaret halsey tells of a new york soldier who often tried to talk with his southern buddies about the race problem somewhat baffled by the results he concluded wryly that on this touchy topic there were just two southsthe silent south and the screaming south the picture of course was never that simple nor the poor poor southas a beaten slaveholder once sadly called itever quite that sick not all of it anyway but while those two souths of miss halseys soldier are still painfully with us it is today two other souths one white and one negro that now play the dominant roles in the regions ongoing racial dramathis bruising and bitter struggle that is bound to affect americas integrity welfare and peace of mind for generations to come one of these newer souths symbolized for many by the forceful dr martin_luther_king jr consists of the impatient growing host that many fearful whites call those pushing negroes these are the rightsdemanding rebels the picketing freedomriding sittingin demonstrators the wallbattering suitfiling crusaders whose blazing fervor recalls the prayer of the old english preacher o lord we beseech thee to guide us aright for we are very determined on the other side arrayed in cool but stubborn opposition stand many of the souths betterclass whites a privileged raceproud elite who too upset to keep silent and too wellbred to scream are venting some pretty unhappy thoughts in grim and often biting language these are the staunch polite determined conservatives of varying shades of outlook and influence who might be termed the gentler standpatters one snowy moonlit night some months ago as we sat before a big log fire in his pleasant pinepaneled den i had a long quietlyrambling talk with one of these troubled white southerners an attractive keen young business man with a college degree he has generously poured out time money and energy in many kinds of public service for both races he has only pity and scorn for the ku klux klan yet there was no mistaking his deep dismay over the bold new spirit of todays fighting negroes and the weapons they use in the steppedup battle to wipe out racial discrimination i think negroes nowadays are making a big mistake he protested when they let the naacp and all these agitators fire them up into pushing so hard and so fast for their rights dont they see what they are throwing away they can keep on fighting this bitter social war if they choose and they probably willbut by golly it isnt going to make our white people love them any better and countless vexed and anxious whites all across the old confederacy are voicing similar plaints as one of my neighbors warmly put it the worst of it is that all this pushing is undermining good race relations and setting back the clock of progress for a generation or more but is it really as a lifelong cardcarrying white southerner i beg to differ as to their strategy and methods let me say i hold no brief for all that todays militant negroes now do and say their leaders obviously are not infallible just because they are underdogs any more than all rankandfile negroes are wise and good and delightful people merely because they belong to a victimized race being human they can make colossal blunders and sometimes do but with all due respect to the gentler standpatters who are neither wilfully unamerican nor brutally callous i think that on the basic issue they are tragically mistaken i cannot believe as they keep insisting that what negroes ought to prize above all and what all good negroes will prize is a tensionfree community marked by unbroken peacethe peace of swallowed pride and stoic submission i cannot agree that the negros only proper course is to remain unfailingly meek and patient indifferent to his own vital interests and content to leave the easing of his woes to time or education or the evolutionary process as a more or less sacred philosophy now widely frozen into public policy this popular viewhowever understandable in the light of historyis today appallingly expensive and wholly indefensible it is i am convinced the white souths most deadly illusion and perhaps the biggest of all the current obstacles to reasonable racial progress in the united states its basic flaw i think can be simply stated in asking for a brand of patience that for millions of people could mean only one thingrenouncing for life their right to firstclass citizenshipthis wellmeant plea flies squarely in the face of human nature it demands the impossible of educated selfrespecting negro americans no one doubts of course that among the nations eighteen million negroes are thousands who are now domesticated to serfdom what healthy selfesteem they once may have had is now drained away no matter how wretched their plight they now seem willing and probably are to settle for the promise of a new deal for their grandchildren but todays rebel negroes emphatically arent no longer bound by the old slave psychology and scorning to grovel or beg or wheedle they are out to claim their american birthright now where debate and conference are possible they gladly reason and confer where doors are shut they knock on them and if need be they bring suit to pry them open their goal avowedly is not special privilege but evenhanded justice the boon of freedom and dignity and opportunity bestowed not on the basis of color but strictly on merit we have no wish to be treated as favorites they say in effect but we do seek and expectto be treated as people offhand one might think the gentler standpatters would find this demand fairly reasonable they are people of awareness and feeling and many are charming polished and in many respects humane why then their stubborn aversion to granting these aroused aspiring negroes the same unlimited chance at the same good things of life that they want for themselves why this fierce defense of inequality that so plainly lays them open to the charge once made by benjamin kidd against englands th century upper classes of being on the wrong side of the biggest moral and social issue of their time it would take at least a book written by top experts in the social sciences to cope with this question and not even that i daresay would wholly unravel the mystery one prime root of the trouble of course is that for most of these decent whites there has been little or no chanceregardless of the quality of their education in other respectsto get a proper education on the race question even where emancipated welltrained teachers and other leaders have stood ready to impart the truth their lips have usually been sealed by a severely repressive political and social climate in the vast majority of southern classrooms where white youngsters are supposedly prepared for life any honest discussion of the race problem is so firmly tabooed that all but the most independent and daring students become no better informed about it than about the chemistry and physics say of outer space be that as it may the sober truth is that one of the gentler standpatters favorite arguments that within the framework of segregation the white south is doing for negroes now about all that any negroes have a right to expect has now been demolished by a body of facts so impressive that one flouts it only at the risk of writing himself down as illogical undemocratic and strangely if not willfully blind this is not to suggest that all white supremacy policies as framed and supported by the souths more enlightened citizens have been unrelievedly black plainly they havent in one field especially despite all the inequalities and favoritism that flow inevitably from segregation the old paternal system has brought new life and hope to thousands of negroes by opening before them partway at least the doors of learning for generations ever since the populist uprising of the s the souths more humane and perceptive whites have stood firmlyoften against bitter oppositionfor public education for both races nor should the good fruits of this policy be minimized or forgotten not only has illiteracy among the regions negroes dropped sharplyfrom around per cent just after the civil war to less than per cent nowbut growing ranks of negro youth have steadily pressed on beyond the bare three rs to high school college and professional training in recent decades in particular this spreading hunger for knowledge intensified for many by the seminal liberating forces of two world wars has brought forth what now suddenly seems very strange fruit to many on the cosier side of the caste curtain this is a whole new selfconfident negro generation that not only knows not uncle tom but declines even to honor his memory but this it need hardly be said is just the rub today of rip van winkle the storybook fellow who dozed off before and didnt wake up until long after yorktown a thoughtful teacher once remarked that his real tragedy was not that he slept for twenty years but that he slept through a revolution and this precisely has been the tragedy of too many of the souths most highminded and powerful whites this revolution that has so stirred and wakened the younger negroes being almost wholly a segregated revolution has left the more sheltered whites as a group dozing placidly in a corner now that the winds of change are rattling their windows many are slowly rousing and rubbing their eyes but their longconditioned feelings their legendtinted racial sentiments and their gaynineties concept of the negros rightful place and role in american society all these remain pretty much intact and one result is that the myth of the satisfied welltreated negro lingers unabashedly on amazingly alive and kicking even among whites who ought to know betterand often in the highest of circles consider for example a comment tossed off by the honorable ben fortson georgias secretary of state in a talk with a newsweek reporter flatly charging that in the north they dont give a damn about the negro mr fortson declared warmly that the negro gets a fairer shake in the south because white southerners take a personal interest in him here you have neatly poured and mixed one of the souths most potent tranquilizersa mellow draught of agedinthewood folklore that vast numbers of otherwise hardheaded southerners tend to swallow without question but a question embarrassing though it be cries out to be raised what white southerners take what kind of personal interest in what negroes bound by the old habit of lumping all negroes into one big faceless category most whites never put the question that way but that i submit is the only realistic way to pose it for the unblinkable fact is that while some white southerners do take a patronizing interest in some negroes the vast majority take only a jealous political interest in most negroes and normally the main purpose of that concern is to keep all negroes in their place no matter how wellequipped deserving and legallyentitled they happen to be to get out of it now and then to be sure even in these fretful embittered days below the potomac one still hears wellmeaning segregationists earnestly protesting that they love the negro by which is meantmore often than notthat they feel a warm glow of sentiment commonly a blend of gratitude dependence pity and maybe nostalgic respect for some mammyimage for those negroes nearest their families who accept or seem to accept their place yet the very earnestness of these whites and the tone in which they affirm this affection make it painfully clear that they have no real awareness of this social siberia to which their love would banish all negroes merely because they are negroes it is true enough that in those negroes who happen to be their servantstheir cooks maids chauffeurs janitors yard men or other close employeesmany of these betteroff highminded southern whites do take a genuine kindly and often deeply appreciated personal interest and this vintage grace of the age of noblesse obligeso often and so fondly depicted in romantic novels from swallow barn to gone with the windcannot firmly be wholly scorned without it the lot of countless southernborn negroes from frederick douglass and hariett tubman to leontyne price and willie mayswould in some respects have been far more grievous but say all one may in its defense it was never more than a balm a palliative like an icepack on a fevered brow a mor phine shot in the arm it has doubtless done much to soothe the slow burn of segregation it has done nothing to heal it and never will where this benign concern abides among southern whites today it is typically and generally an emotion more condescending than compassionate prompted less by fellow feeling than by a sense i of honor and with its outward expression confined mainly to an occasional tip or bonus a christ mast basket special help in trouble or sickness and maybe a generous donation now and then to the servants church or lodge as for any open active concern for the negros deeper yearnings and aspirationshis simple human urge to be seen and valued as a person his wish for a decent home in a good neighborhood and his frequently flaming eagerness for something more than the scraps and leftovers and handmedowns of a white mans worldthis feeling is not merely rare it is commonly so taboo that whites who dare display it are often pilloried as niggerlovers dogooders communist sympathizers and traitors to their class thus to argue as many whites do that todays negroes ought to quit pushing and let the issue be settled by strictly quiet noncontroversial meansthis is not only to be naive it is to flout a fine old american tradition by demanding in effect that negroes be denied a timehonored weapon of social change that americans of most groups and parties have freely employed since the birth of our republic it seems a fairly safe bet certainly that few if any white southerners who make this plea or white northerners either would care to swallow their own prescription like their forebears from on down they normally feel no call to forego in defense of their own vital interests any valid protest or pressure the situation may demand many would be horrified if anyone suggested they should if their childrens school say got outrageously shortchanged in some crucial allocation of funds they would hardly shrug and say oh well time will take care of things eventually more likely than not they would call on the offending board and start pressing for action now nor could anyone doubt their reaction if the board dared to urge them for the sake of peace and goodwill to calm down and leave the matter to the tender mercies of the evolutionary process as injured parents they might not get what they wanted then or later but they would not like to be called extremists for raising a howl and only a pollyanna could believe that in many such situations anyway their cause would stand a ghost of a chance if they failed to howl whats more to contend that todays antisegregation pressures are coming too soon and too fast is to overlook some hard realities about the way any social order normally moves and changes regardless of how insistently or firmly negroes now push it ought to be clear that no drastic upheaval in the souths racial patterns is coming overnight the cold fact is as countless reform movements in our history attest that it is only by longcontinued boldly dramatized discontent and by vast amounts of seemingly immoderate agitation that any constructive nonviolent change has been achieved even gradually in a social habit as deeprooted as americas intenselyvenerated custom of racial segregation most militant negroes certainly understand this clearly enough they are not blind to the lessons of history they arent out to start a bloody revolution and they know that even in the year both the north and the south in more than a few spots may still be a long way from being remodeled to their hearts desire but if they havent yet fully learned it these fencedin rebels are learning fast that any successful reformer as one of our best historians put it must be a disturber of the peace who often trespasses on forbidden ground and commits assault and battery on human complacency like lawmakers in a fiercely partisan congress these negroes know that they must usually ask for about twice what they hopefully expect in order to get a third or fourth or even less of what they want since politics even in far less controversial areas is always the art of the possible theyve found that civilrights politics is often the art of extracting from defiant and diehard opponents the mere crumbs of the possible and having been taught it by sad experience they know that winning a paper triumph in congress or the courts is often only the prelude to a long and agonizing struggle to make the law of the land the halfhearted practice of atlanta dallas and miami or even of pittsburgh st louis new york san francisco and chicago the odds being what they are so grueling and discouraging a battle to be sure may well sift out the usual handful of sunshine patriots and summer soldiers indeed it already has but to think that the great majority will be frightened off by threats intimidation or reprisals or to imagine that the whole crusade can somehow be stopped by governors piously preaching defiance and insurrection is about like believing that one can hold back the dawn by shaking his fist at the rising sun to adamant southern standpatters gentle or otherwise who say in effect stop fighting our cherished way of life or you may lose your shirt in the process many a fearless negro now seems to be replying i may even lose my life but ive reached the point where i think id rather die that way than to go on as things are and be humiliated to death an englishman gandhi once said never respects you until you stand up to him then he begins to like you and many of todays aggressive negroes i suspect have concluded this is no less true of their present adversaries having as a race been taught to bow and scrape before the white man and having seen this posture bring little if any increase in the freedom and justice accorded them they have now chosen to stand up and assert themselves this may not to be sure make white americans like them any better but neither they seem to be saying could it make millions of whites respect or like them any less as human beings and fellowcitizens anyway and whether most americans turn out to be like gandhis englishman or not one thing these fighting negroes figure seems sure their present mood and stance can hardly fail to make the world at largeeast and west colored and noncoloredrespect and applaud them far more a new life rising despair of from the total disablement to a busy and productive life former basketball star junius kellogg has become a living legend of how the handicapped can ij play a dynamic role in industry and community affairs kellogg was just embarking on an outstanding professional basketball career with the harlem globetrotters when a tragic automobile accident ended his playing days in the accident which occurred near pine bluff arkansas left him in a coma for ten days and when he came to all four limbs were paralyzed he could only move his head for weeks kellogg hovered between life and death at the veterans administration hospital in little rock and physicians believed that only his superb physical con dition attained while a star for the manhattan college basketball team during the early s and later with the globetrotters enabled him to withstand the shock of his extensive injuries because of irreparable damage to his spinal cord doctors told him he would never be able to move his limbs again but an intensive rehabilitation program was soon begun and a physical therapist helped him exercise every joint daily it was a slow and apparently futile procedure until one day he discovered he could move a thumb given this impetus kellogg intensified his efforts until only his legs remained immobilized about six months after the accident kellogg was moved to the kingsbridge veterans hospital only a few miles from the manhattan college campus in the bronx new york at kingsbridge kellogg met an outstanding business executive who channeled his tremendous drive to make a new start in life the businessman was john s woodbridge pan american world airways comptroller who knew what it meant to suffer a severe injury and have to struggle to regain a normal life he had been badly injured while fighting with the french blue devils in world war i and by strength of will helped himself back to health woodbridge grateful for his own recovery knew that once a man was down didnt mean he couldnt make a comeback and with that in view he became a pioneer in the relatively untried policy of hiring disabled persons he had only one criterionthe ability of a person to do a job there is a misguided belief that since there is physical failure there must also be a mental barrier on the part of the man to display his ability woodbridge explains not content with merely hiring the disabled woodbridge also organized a wheelchair basketball team to advertise the dexterity and skill of such men and thats where kellogg came into stay when woodbridge spotted a man with such ability as kellogg in kingsbridge hospital he immediately asked him if he would coach the pan am jets kellogg readily agreed and he has helped to establish the paraplegic team as an international symbol of hope for thousands of handicapped persons around the world kellogg coached the team during periodic leaves from kingsbridge while still undergoing therapy there it was also at kingsbridge that he met another person who would change his life this was a pretty young social worker whose soft words and understanding also helped him to regain his cheer and confidence her name was clementine and kellogg fell in love with her and then he got up the courage to ask her to marry him since i made up my mind to lead as normal a life as possible i wasnt afraid of marriage he says after all marriage is as much a part of life as anything about a year after he entered kingsbridge he and clementine were married they moved into a comfortable bronx apartment selected to enable kellogg to come and go with ease the next big step for him was to get a fulltime job and here his friend woodbridge helped him again one day mr woodbridge asked me when are you going to start working i told him id studied to be a physical education teacher in college and i wasnt prepared to do any other kind of work mr woodbridge arranged for me to take special courses that enabled me to go to work for pan americans accounting department ive been with pan am ever since kellogg suggests that learning to accept ones limitations is essential to gaining maximum potential out of life when youre confined to a wheelchair acceptance is the whole thing in a nutshell he continues youve got to train for a job you can do in a wheelchair obviously some jobs just cant be done by paraplegics but there are many jobs open in offices and professional fields and the situation is constantly improving the main thing is that first you must have the desire to train yourself and then you must qualify kellogg adds employers must also have the willingness to hire disabled persons some employers however go to the other extreme and only hire the handicapped i dont think this is very healthy its best for disabled persons to work in an integrated atmosphere and not in a closed shop where he only encounters other disabled persons since leaving the hospital kellogg has led a normal and active lifeso active that it would put many persons with good legs in rest homes but such activity only seems to give him increasing satisfaction and happiness in addition to his duties at pan americans administrative headquarters in long island city kellogg finds time to fill eight or ten speaking engagements every month there are also the practice and coaching sessions with the jets who play about eight games a month i get a chance to exercise a lot with the other fellows this way so its good for me too he says the jets participate in the international paralympics at london every year and they have captured five world championships in wheelchair athletics the players are versatile and not only participate in basketball but in swimming table tennis discus and hammer throwing also in kellogg led the jets on a tour of brazil and the team played exhibitions before persons winning the plaudits of the south american countrys president for their inspiring exam pie to the disabled everywhere pan american also has flown the team to berlin and israel to demonstrate the abilities of handicapped persons the airlines activities on behalf of the handicapped have brought it numerous awards including citations from the federation of the handicapped and the presidents committee on employment of the physically handicapped last year the paralyzed veterans of america selected pan american as employer of the year for its outstanding record of employment of paraplegics and other physically handicapped persons

magnificent t in florence italy connotes the highest expression of art in all its ramifications florence became the treasure house of the loveliest objects in the world long before columbus discovered the new world lorenzo succeeded his father in and for nine years ruled jointly with his younger brother giuliano this brother who was assassinated in left an illegitimate son guilio and this guilio became pope of the roman catholic church in as clement vii however in plain american there was a nigger in the woodpile for long before clement vii was considered for high honors and princely attainmentlong before the smoke slowly poured forth from the chimney of the consistorial chambers of the vatican in rome announcing his successful election to the papacyguilio as a youth had fallen desperately in love with an african venus whom some claimed was a slave others a trusted servant in the ducal household this woman anna bore a child alessandro to the future pope then to save her good name and that of guilio she was quickly married off to the duke of urbino who reigned in the city that gave birth to raphael all the authorities acknowledge these facts his mother was a mulatto slave and he had dark skin thick lips and the curly hair of a negro there is no doubt of this though none cared at the time to contradict the popes assertion that he was the son of lorenzo duke of urbino and as such he has generally been mentioned in history historians contending themselves with saying he was reputed to be so but was more probably clements own son again he is described as alessandro whose wooly hair and negrolike appearance had already caused him to be called the moor yet another has said his mother was a woman of color a tartar slave girl who passed for a wife of a courier trollope the american historian of the florentine commonwealth after looking at alessandros picture discovers naturally that he was of low type but in this judgment he does not agree with the great emperor charles king of spain and emperor of the holy roman empire charles while staying at the medici palace with alessandro relates how pleasant it was to meet the popes relative there must be secreted or pigeonholed somewhere interesting facts concerning this favorite boy before he was taken within the sacred cloisters of the vatican alessandro annas boy was a shrewd lad and was naturally disliked and feared by his ambitious relatives but he became the inseparable companion of pope clement vii when the wheel of life registered his thirteenth birthday alessandro blossomed out with undisputed rights to the distinguished line of the medici succession the fine italian hand of the pope unseen but clearly in evidence was behind his godson and ippolito cardinal and illegitimate grandson of lorenzo had no earthly chance to win the ducal throne on a political chessboard directed by the popes master mind his eminent guardian bestowed great honors and princely gifts on alessandro in he made him joint ruler of florence with his cousin ippolito and under the guardianship of cardinal passerini but the city was in turmoil and expelled its rulers thereupon pope clement made peace and alliance with the emperor charles v and the emperor captured florence in then the emperor graciously assisted the pope in carrying out his wishes to promote the welfare of his son an agreement was signed at bologna and alessandro became first hereditary duke of florence charles v renowned in the military and political horizon of the old world and associated with the wealth and possessions of the new world was power personified and of his children both his daughter margaret of parma like her celebrated halfbrother don juan of austria who crushed the turkish fleet at the battle of lepanto were illegitimate the silent and beautiful monument of alessandro first duke of florence parian marble in the escorial monastery pantheon of the spanish kings describes don juan to the casual visitor as filius naturalis likewise was the daughter margaret who at the age of fifteen was betrothed to alessandro the mulatto medici the barcelona treaty of the marriage provides that alessandro the natural son of clement vii should marry margaret thus dropping all affected doubts on the subject of alessandros parentage the royal nuptials took place at san lorenzo with all the pomp which a ruling emperor of germany king of spain and naples etc could command for his daughter as a bride the pope clement vii head of the catholic church all powerful and mighty most feared in those days of temporal powers ruler over great dominions gave to his natural son generous gifts befitting his station both parents were entirely satisfied and lavished enough money on the event to ransom a kings crown but the throne which alessandro gained was not easy to hold the nobles were incensed at their loss of power to a hereditary monarch confirmed by imperial patent and royal alliance there was no question of color or race but a bitter fight for lost privileges conspiracy was rife centering about cardinal ippolito who was poisoned perhaps by order of alessandro the character of alessandro has been disputed he was true medici patron of art and ruler of men he surrounded himself with distinguished and able councillors vellori guiciardini and valori but he was also a medici in his pleasures and excesses and he was surrounded by medici like his cousin lorenzino who betrayed him and murdered him in his sleep with the help of a hired desperado on january the night outside showed the silvery stars twinkling as the clock ticked away the minutes indoors low and high ecclesiastics gathered hurriedly attendants were there to place the lifeless body of the duke of florence in the tomb of the duke urbino silently with low words they offered prayers for the repose of a soul ushered into eternity the marble slab was gently replaced and every indication of forcing the tomb cleared away the assassins made their escape and for a time consternation reigned supreme in florence cosimo i alessandros cousin and successor caused the traitors house to be destroyed making the place a street for the masses to tread on the wretched regicide four centuries later in fair and lovely florence in the palaces of the medici you may have strolled through the galleries of unsurpassed sculpture artistic objects of infinite beauty and wondered how all these priceless articles could be gathered in this city long before columbus discovered america here where michelangelo exercised his manysided genius where titians canvases resplendent in their charming and beautiful colors view each other with soulful eyeshere in the uffizi gallery is one picture that brings you back to look at it again you will have noticed among the bronzinos remarkable paintings one labelled alessandro look at it again carefully and you will be drawn closer by the fact it is unlike those other white men and rosecolored fair women scattered in those magnificent halls among tombs of their ducal heads do not for a moment think that it is the picture of a menial an efficient porter or a pleasant waiter make no such mistake it is the picture of the mulatto duke i think if this had happened in north america the picture would have been removed long ago and by some plausible excuse relegated to the cellar or entirely discarded but the florentines lived up to the judgment of history the truth cannot be always concealed from the eyes of the world so here is the unvarnished story of the picture a young man of negro descent was married to the daughter of the emperor of germany king of spain and king of naples and he the first duke of florence during days of shadow and adversity florence would seek with devoutness and piety the black virgin of the impruneta to be carried through the streets as an intercessional to help bring back peace and prosperity to the people they had no prejudice against a black face for their patron saint was the color of the first duke of florence alexander dumas pere negro digest july distinguished in french letters and selfacknowledged of negro descent foremost historical novelist of his day if not of all days has left us this apt word let the medici rest in peace in their tombs of marble and porphyry for they have done more for the glory of the world than any king prince or emperor the first negro by leo militelio ntil recently little was y known about bishop i ii j r james augustine healv the first cath s olic negro bishop of the united states when the fact was rediscovered by historians foley albert s sj bishop healy beloved outcaste farrow straus and young bishop healy once again became a prominent figure in the history of the catholic church in america perhaps the interest taken in the bishops life was at first due to the impact this would have upon the problem of segregation in the united states with the study of his life though it does not take long to realize that there is more to james augustine healy than the mere fact that he was colored his whole life is permeated with a deep love for god and his fellowmen regardless of whether these men were black or white irish or french catholic or protestant he was a father to his flock his childrens bishop james augustine healy was born in macon georgia on april his father michael was a catholic irish immigrant his mother mary eliza a slave woman michael always treated his wife as an equal and he loved her very much their marriage proved to be a very successful one for god blessed this union with ten children god was very pleased with the healys because three of the healy boys became priests and two of the girls entered the religious life the healy family lived quietly on their georgia plantation the boys were trained and educated at home at first but michael was soon made to realize that should he die his whole family would be considered slaves by the state of georgia imprisoned and sold one day some of michaels neighbors were taking advantage of his hospitality one of them began to make sly and subtle remarks about his wife eliza the pretty wench who kept house for him when one fellow went so far as to remark that michael had a mighty nice bunch of slave boys who would bring a good price on the slave market michael could take no more jumping up he turned toward his house and yelled mary eliza turn loose the dogs his neighbors instantly disappeared never to return it was this incident that made michael decide to take his boys away from such narrowminded men michael then enrolled james in a quaker school in new york this was the only private school that would admit the boy with the telltale marks of his ancestry it was not long before his brothers hugh and patrick joined him there the boys were not too happy at this school for they suffered much from this friendly brotherhood group james was a very sensitive boy he was deeply hurt by the sly whispers and dirty epithets scribbled on the walls about him and his brothers which he resented more he could not say the meanness of his playmates or the patronizing attitude of his abolitionist schoolmasters exiled from the plantation james found himself an outcast back in georgia the healy plantation continued to prosper michael took part in the social life of the county but only in a business and governmental capacity he knew that mary eliza would never be accepted by the puritanical and narrowminded georgians there was not a catholic church in macon when michael settled there and the phariseesism of his neighbors kept him from partaking in their religious worship michael detested these men who raised a brood of yard children and then sold them into slavery demanding a higher price for them because they were mulattoes about the year while michael was returning from a visit to his boys he met bishop fitzpatrick of boston michael told the kind bishop of the plight of his boys and the bishop induced him to send them to the newly established holy cross college in worcester massachusetts michael was very much impressed by the reception the jesuit fathers gave his boys here it was that the healy boys became catholics it was not long before james reached the top of his class scholastically with his brother hugh running a close second after graduation from holy cross college james decided to go on to the priesthood after confiding all his difficulties and worries to his spiritual father dad fenwick james left for the sulpician seminary in montreal james wrote back to dad fenwick i am just about in the same reputation here as i was at worcester that is a laughing godforgetting rascal good enough when he behaves himself a great lover of theology especially dogma and the classics in june of james received tonsure and four minor orders in his brother sherwood entered the seminary in montreal in this same year james received his subdeaconate and then crossed the ocean to continue his studies in the famous sulpician seminary in paris finally on june the memorable day arrived and james was ordained a priest of god by archbishop sibour in the cathedral of notre dame in paris bishop fitzpatrick welcomed james into the diocese of boston it was at this time that james wrote to dad fenwick the mercy of god has placed a poor outcast on a throne of glory that ill becomes him if i could have been as safe elsewhere as here i should have desired never to show my face in boston james had good reason to fear boston anticatholic feeling ran high there james first appointment was as assistant at the guardian angel home a home for all wayward boys father james and his boys soon became close friends but father james did not limit his work to the orphans he daily visited the wharf tenements here in the irish ghettos he administered to the cholera typhoid and tuberculosis victims such misery was very common among these outcast people it was especially for his work among these people and the love he showed them that he later won the title of best loved priest in the diocese of boston during the year boston became once again the center of the bitter struggle against the catholic church the nativists took over bishop fitzpatrick found himself forced to engage in public political battle if the church were to survive there to help him he appointed father james as his secretary father james threw himself wholeheartedly into this new job which was at the same time a promotion for him the cathedral parishioners were soon spellbound by his preaching which was simple but strong together with the bishop he tramped and went about the slums of boston visiting the sick comforting the sorrowful and afflicted and caring for the many orphans both men were heroic in their work among the immigrants during the cholera epidemic from bishop fitzpatrick james learned how to deal with the noncatholics of boston and new england he saw how they admired bishop fitzpatrick because he was not afraid to make himself heard because he was deeply patriotic and because he constantly invoked the principles of the american constitution when the civil war broke out in father james and bishop fitzpatrick found their fellow priest the rector of the cathedral father hilary tucker a staunch southerner father hilary argued at table with the bishop and father james when father hilary began thundering his views from the cathedral pulpit bishop fitzpatrick removed him from the position of rector and installed father james in his place that father james untiringly fulfilled his added duties as pastor of souls had to be admitted even by his strongest rival father hilary father hilary who remained at the cathedral continually criticized his opponent but was finally won over to father james by his patient charity and friendly attitude despite all the bitter criticisms in when bishop fitzpatrick died father james was appointed to succeed the newly elected bishop john williams as the pastor of the biggest parish in boston st james for the next nine years he devoted himself to this flock and became known as the beloved pastor of st james the story is told of how father james saved his parish during the great boston fire of november just three blocks from his church the flames whipped up and down taking everything in their path firemen were powerless and water was scarce it looked as if the whole south side of the city would be destroyed as the people of his parish frantically began packing their possessions in an attempt to save what little they could father james came out of church prayer book in hand he walked to the corner of summer and lincoln there he stood guard opening his prayer book he began to pray aloud as the flames drew near father james companions left him and soon he stood all alone suddenly as he prayed the wind changed and the fire began to head for the wharf sixtyfive acres of the city were destroyed and buildings were burned but father james parish was untouched by the holocaust when in the year two of bostons neighboring dioceses became vacant rumors went wild that they would probably be filled by the healy brothers father james brother father sherwood also working in the diocese as secretary to bishop williams was picked by some as the next bishop from boston others favored father james because he was much older when news came from rome in february of that james augustine healy was elected by pope pius ix as the second bishop of portland maine the friends of father james were jubilant when bishopelect healy alighted from his coach in his new diocese he was deeply worried as to whether his flock would accept him would any of the clergy resign would the teaching sisters accept a negro bishop these were a few of the many questions that flashed through his mind that morning immediately after his consecration bishop healy began his first visitation of his diocese it was a real missionary journey by train stagecoach buggy boat and on foot the bishop traveled though he was never strong wrote cardinal oconnell he traveled continually over the length and breadth of his vast diocese and as he spoke english elegantly and french very correctly his sermons in both languages of rather high order were listened to by all his congregations with the greatest interest and edification by the time his first summer was over bishop healy had traveled some miles he administered the sacrament of confirmation to about children and had preached more than a hundred sermons it took courage for the new bishop to mount the pulpit in north whitefields church of st denis where he had been publicly denounced by the pastor because of his indelicate blood the incident that brought about this public denunciation is a very interesting one when bishop healy was still a priest of the diocese in boston he often went to maine for his vacations on one such trip he gathered a number of children together to teach them their catechism because the neighboring priest of st denis church who was in charge of the children neglected them when the priest heard about this he was furious father james begged pardon of the pastor and asked him not to make a public denunciation but to no avail when father james became bishop of maine the embarrassed priest resigned his post bishop healy refused to accept the resignation it wasnt long before bishop healy became known as the childrens bishop they ran to him and walked with him one could often see him walking up and down the sidewalk with three or four children each holding one of his fingers during the winter when there was snow bishop healy would take his beloved children for sleigh rides bishop healy regularly took his turn in the pastoral duties of the cathedral parish he would often say mass in the mission churches attached to the cathedral he even helped out in the small wooden chapel of st aloysius for the convenience of the extremely poor who did not have enough money to buy sunday clothes and who were reluctant to attend mass at the cathedral the bishop loved the poor he often rode through town on his horse with saddle bags full of groceries he would stop at the back doors knock and greet a tired housewife he knew all of the poor by name and he always had a greeting for each of them he often paid their overdue taxes and doctor bills and this he did personally for this afternoon relaxation bishop healy would drop in to visit the sick of the parish old mrs murphy told how the bishop upon hearing that her son was sick with pneumonia threw his cloak over his cassock and hiked through the snow and slush in order to visit the sick lad for his daily work bishop healy heard confessions both while at home and on visitation of his diocese a young girl told how she entered the confessional and halfway through her confession she realized it was the bishop she was confessing to she could not go on the bishop in his kind manner tried to help her i cant tell you the rest of my sins she cried in distress the bishop reminded her that nothing revealed in the confessional could ever be spoken of later but replied the girl its something i said against the bishop well now my child what did you say against the bishop ii said the bishop was as black as the devil the girl blurted out oh my child said the bishop dont say the bishop is as black as the devil you can say hes as black as coal or as black as the ace of spades but dont say hes as black as the devil such forgiving charity could not help but endear him to his flock a young boy related how one afternoon he added to his hurried confession and i called the bishop a nigger the bishop drew aside the curtain and said to the wideeyed boy well son is there anything wrong with being a nigger take a good look at your bishop is there anything wrong with being a nigger the boy gulped and answered oh no bishop it has been just over half a century since bishop healy died on august he had suffered much physically from poor health that is why he could understand so well the sufferings of the epidemicstricken immigrants he suffered mentally from the sly and sharp remarks of the narrowminded bigots and this is why he could sympathize with those suffering from similar trials bishop healy was ever faithful to his great mission of sympathy with those who suffer without distinction of race creed or color so that although the world may forget his color it will never forget his charity the meaning of apartheid by dr horace mann bond o be understood we must always remember that the word apartheid is joined to that of baaskap white supremacy it is a theory that is used to justify the complete domination of per cent of the population of a country by a minority of per cent this is the naked and unashamed policy of the national government in every nation the national policy finds in the educational system its ultimate instrument for perpetuating as well as perfecting the national aspiration in south africa this national will is reflected in numerous enactments covering every phase of life the legislation governing education is as elsewhere the ultimate embodiment of policy for today and for generations yet to comeindeed one nationalist leader has projected the state of things envisioned as enduring for two thousand years the basic educational legislation governing the fate and destiny of the vast majority of south africas population is the bantu education act of under this act complete control by the state is made the prerequisite of state assistance to education ordinarily no one could take exception to such a provision it is the diabolical expression of the minority but dominant will to enforce both apartheid and baaskap that adds an utterly sinister quality to the provision other provisions of the act placed its administration under the department of native affairs rather than under the department of education a step that emphasizes the fact that the intent was the perfection of apartheid rather than educational the aim of education was that of developing the individual as a member of society so that he can take his rightful place within the society to which he belongs and where is the rightful place of the african in south african society it is that of a subhuman tender of an inhuman machine given just enough educationrather training to permit him to tend the machine it is that of an agricultural serf tied to the every demand of his white baas it is as a member of an impoverished tribal society condemned to semistarvation in a bantustan where he remains as a convenient reservoir of black labor but let me introduce here the eloquent testimony of chief albert luthuli nobel laureate on the bantu education act bantu education came into effect in it is a specialized type of education designed exclusively by europeans exclusively for africans it is not as were former educational systems in south africa designed simply by adults for children it is not to be judged on the details of its syllabuses though what i know of these is shoddy enough it can be understood only in the light of the declared intentions of its begetters in the context of other legislation enforcing the masterservant relationship and by its effects the principle of school boards is excellent in practice in the present situation it is harmfuland the african communities are never freely represented on them the effect of providing one teacher for a minimum of sixtyfive children is to reduce efficiency the effect in a fastdeveloping society with a growing population of limiting to v million pounds per year the government money contribution to african education for all time is to bleed the poorest section of the community dry and to insure progressive stunting of african education for lack of funds the effect of forcing african parents to choose between school feeding and school building is to impoverish us poorer still under the new system state provision of books has disappeared too and that makes us poorer still even though the government now pays the teachersa mercy denied to us by the smuts government the effect of double sessions taught by the same teachers is to overburden them to the point of exhaustion while the effect of twentyminute lessons is to waste much time of what there is the effect of using only the many vernaculars as media of instruction is to cut children off deliberately and violently from access to outside influences and ideasand the heritage of much of the civilized world this of course brings us to the heart of the matter african children have previously had some small access to the commonwealth of learning they have reached out many of them after its riches and many of our african doctors and lawyers and teachers have proved themselves able to absorb not only learning but western culture in less than two thousand years in south africa this has set up tensions and evoked the threat of encroachment upon the white standard of living and allwhite rule so the door has to be slammed shut hard in the faces of the young generation and a system devised which will recondition us to accept perpetual inferiority and perpetual isolation from western learning and culture to isolate us and to convince us of our permanent inferiority these two motives lie behind much legislation and from the act of union until now and the bantu education act is a major means to this end whatever may be said in favour of certain altered details of bantu education and i do not deny that here and there is to be found a minor improvement or two the overall effect of this system is not educational at all but political it is a tool in the hands of the white master for the more effective reduction and control of the black servant i have quoted chief lithuli at length both because his simple eloquence describes this utterly inhumaneeven monstrouseducational procedure better than i could but also because this great man himself illustrates the paramount importance for a world seeking peace and freedom of keeping open the free flow of culture from the past to the present and so to the future it is also interesting to note that chief luthuli and other leaders in the struggle for freedom in south africa are closely related and indeed frequently indebted to a pipeline that led from the ancient past to the lonely outpost of freedom this man now occupies and americans of african descent fortuitously or in the grand mechanics of human destiny proved foremost as carriers of the flame note here that i am not talking about christian principles nor even of what is sometimes called western civilization chief luthuli himself deprecates the idea when he says the christian faith sprang from asia minor and to this day it speaks with a semitic voice western civilization is only partly western it embraces the contribution of many lands and many races it is an inheritance something received to be handed on not a white preserve what chief luthuli is speaking ibid p of is that idea of concern for the individual and for his worth that flowed out of ancient china and india and out of the mesopotamian valleys on the wings of hammurabis stylus and out of the arabian deserts and the egyptian and greek temples and from the upper reaches of the nile where peasants and scribes and princes were black he is speaking of the very crux of the human matter of the old old notions that were preserved through the ages by moorish caliphs entertaining indiscriminately in their palaces men of learning who were arab and jew african and european and whose genius helped revive a somnolent europe and set in motion that renaissance of learning from which the contemporary culture we call western was manufactured by william barrow the many faces of he also has the unique ability to look the part a normally handsome man of tan color

actor without regard to race early disproved the contention that negro actors should be confined to negro roles his access to roles also proved that all producers in the motion picture and television

herron hill by a b andover years ago when y t ii a v we moved to herron i j hill we thought we u were settled for a lifetime in a pleasant neighborhood in central pittsburgh we can drive either to the golden triangle business district or to the oakland civic center in five minutes although ours is a nondescript endhouse in a fourunit row we like it our backyard is small but in march the cardinals tune up and later in the spring we see wrens goldfinches and of course robins an occasional hummingbird drinks from our butterfly bushes and a mantis prayed through one summer on our blue morning glory in good fruitbearing years our neighbor gives us treeripened peaches and he would share his cherries too but the birds strip these before he can gather them fortunately the birds bypass the apples so we have deepdish cobblers and sauce from august until frost we feed the squirrels and rabbits that wander by from the wild hillsides i do the best i can to ignore the garter snakes on sweltering july nights we particularly enjoy our backyard because it is equipped with one very comfortable hammock for my hus band a relaxing beach chair for me and a dependable breeze our backyard measures only twentybyfifty feet and is completely surrounded by adjoining houses but it affords almost the privacy of a country estate a dense vine of hops covering our fence provides a barrier to stray animals or curious passersby now all of this is changing our little eden has been invaded by vermin brought to our street on herron hill by careless neighbors who moved here after being pushed out of the lower hill district now rats chew through the large mounds of refuse from the overflowing garbage cans in our block roaches infest my kitchen bedbugs and mice stage blitzkrieg sorp ties up and down our row on hot days when the windows are open the stench is terrible the rats were the first sign that the neighborhood was changing these appeared promptly when a new family moved into the house back of us after unloading their furniture they immediately patched together a chicken coop from some odds and ends of scrap lumber and wire the materials were donated by an adjoining newcomer who had just as promptly installed a junk business in his backyard several families complained to the city health department about the junk and the chickens which violate our health and sanitation ordinances by the time the city checked the complaint the rats had moved in to stay our rats could be seen day and night crossing our backyard on their way from their comfortable nests in the junk pile to the chicken yard for their necessary nourishment after repeated warnings of legal action by the city the chickens made a slow exit onebyone into the family pot i presume the junk yard is still with us the last time i discussed this nuisance with the city complaint center i gathered that the complaint officer on the other end of the telephone didnt care much what happens on herron hill he seemed concerned as long as he thought our block was somewhere in the allwhite schenley farms section of the hill when he suddenly realized that we are located in the negro herron hill side his tone changed as he cut short my complaint with an abrupt ok ill be out in the years which have passed the junk pile has continued and the rats are snugly multiplying in their comfortable quarters ive been assured that nothing short of a cataclysm will remove these pests once theyve established a good beachhead in a natural habitat such as our adjoining junk yard occasionally we have a short respite from the roaches that infest our house after we put on an allout drive with the modern deadly chemicals developed for jungle warfare during world war ii what worked so successfully in the south pacific gives only temporary relief in our row house on herron hill our hardy pests dont drop dead they retreat for a brief rest in their combat headquarters in the third house in our row the family in this house consists of three adults three children a dog and a paralyzed pet henall crowded into four rooms the fifth room is rented to an elderly invalid who has a prolific cat no wonder the roaches retreat to these quarters to restore their strength for the next attack on us from this same house were also constantly threatened with bedbugs and mice but these are easiest to control fortunately im alerted when theyre on the march my friend maggie not so fortunate lives in the second unit between me and the third family and naturally shes attacked first i am procrastinating about moving out of this row because i once enjoyed it so much but when maggie leaves as shes threatening to do my days here will be numbered its easy to blame our new neighbors for the bad conditions we now live with but i cant forget that they are really victims not culprits they are the victims of pittsburghs poor planning for its urban redevelopment because lowcost housing is unavailable for negro families compelled to move by the demolition of the lower hill district they were forced to purchase property which they cant afford they are meeting their mortgage payments by subletting a room which they need so badly for their own family im annoyed because their crowded unsanitary living affects my household but they are the ones who face the more serious problem meeting the payments on a mortgage for a house which sold for ten years ago im more annoyed that pittsburghs touted urban redevelopment plan demolishes the slums in the lower hill only to transplant the blight to our block in herron hill the family in the fourth unit of our row for instance meets the payments on their mortgage with the income from a weekend barbecue their barbecue is the most tantalizing however illicit small business in our block from friday through sunday we are besieged with the delectable odor of pork basted frequently with an authentic hot sauce roasting on an honesttogoodness pit over slowly burning coals i can resist the temptation to patronize my neighbors commissary because i know the succulent ribs are only a promotional comeon the profitable sales item here is not food but the drinks in a package deal for one dollar customers are served two ribs on one slice of bread a dab of cole slaw and one shot of cheap blended whiskey or gin cut of course the profit must be terrific can you stop after eating only two ribs of real southern barbecued pork i probably would succumb to the enticing ribs if i didnt have the confirmed bourbon drinkers dislike for blended whiskies anyhow so far i have resisted the barbecue and all of the other rent parties or socials which are now so common in our section of herron hill saturday naturally is the favorite day for these socials because they can continue until dawn or even throughout the sabbath if the games are hot gambling is an accepted part of the entertainment and with the excellent food customers can enjoy poker pinochle whist black jack crap or bingo but never bridge bridge is too slow for a fast house cut the quiet of the early sunday morning hours on herron hill suddenly ends when the guests emerge from these festivities after an evening of sport they are in a mood to express all of the emotions known to man some are jubilant others arc depressed by the surfeit of pleasure but all are raucous i have yet to hear their noisy leavetaking interrupted by the soothing sound of police cars arriving to halt the proceedings by a long overdue raid some socials are very quiet guests are carefully screened and personally invited by the hosts to these select affairs held in comfortable or even sumptuous recreation rooms here suave croupiers smoothly remove those who become objectionably loud the owners devious weekend activities which supplement their regular incomes must not taint their reputations as respectable residents of herron hill another small business also operates quietly and efficiently in our block pretty call girls can be seen speeding away in taxicabs after completing their work in the fancy afterhours spot across the street from us the numbers baron who lives next door to this spot is particularly disturbed his young son has asked dad several awkward questions about the girls our baron is scurrying around to find a house in a more conventional neighborhood so that his son can spend his formative years in the proper environment you may marvel at a racketeers strong feelings about a vice which should not disturb him of all people but numbers now is a respectable business in our block welldressed collectors make their daily pickup around noon crisscrossing our street missing few houses they enjoy about the same status as sam the fruit and vegetable huckster who has served two generations of herron hill customers something else also seems to be going on in our neighborhood now without knowing it i probably associate with dope addicts but recently i encountered one whom a policeman with only a cursory glance labelled hophead a stranger to me she rushed into my house through the back door screaming theyre after me she collapsed on my kitchen floor i locked the door called the police then rapped sharply on the dining room wall in an sos for maggie next door maggie rushed over we thought the girl on my floor had really fainted after escaping her pursuers we were positive that the policeman was wrong when they hustled her out to the patrol car after assuring us that she was only hoppedup later in the evening when my husband came home before maggie and i could finish our exciting story he commenced laughing at us for not recognizing a hophead immediately we still werent convinced but on the following dayr a police investigator called confirmed the dope charge and asked for details about the incident shortly afterwards we read that a dope squad had raided in our block and found a considerable cache on one of our unassuminglooking new neighbors as i think of the changes which have taken place on herron hill since pittsburghs redevelopment started i wonder if somehow we didnt get the cart before the horse lowcost private housing for all of the families to be displaced rated the top spot in our plans something happened to those plans and the funds arrived too late to construct the houses nevertheless the demolition of the lower hill district proceeded as scheduled and the evacuated families crowd ed into other areas where housing shortages have existed for a long time for negro residents true city hall as its part in the redevelopment passed new housing ordinances to eliminate tene ments forever and to improve health and sanitation but the rats in my backyard point to ineffectual administration of the statutes also the barbecue and after hour spots raise some doubts about the police vigilance in our neighborhood frederick gutheim who evaluated pittsburghs redevelopment for the architectural forum observed the time has come when projects are probably not enough when indeed the problems they are creating are becoming nearly as important as the problems which existed before and which they have claimed to eradicate clearing the slums in the lower hill cost pittsburgh wonder how much it will cost us someday to clear the slums of herron hill i know its going to cost me a lot to move away the democrat by richard a kalish he japs are nice peoq r pie and all but i just dont think they under d stand american ways gjr j j met n yokohama for an example but first i figure i better tell you some things about the japs that maybe you dont know first off dont ever talk about them as japs its okay between us because you know i dont mean no disrespect but its insulting when you do it right to their faces like this nisei captain i had he was a jap but he was born and raised in los angeles and he was just like he was an american he said to never use the word jap because it was insulting but to always use japanese and i wouldnt want to show no disrespect for them because the truth is that i respect them people except that they should learn more about democracy the japs are a honest people and very kind to children and very polite except on trains when they are real bastards even the women now about this jap girl i was talking about i really liked her she was nice enough to marry although i dont go along with this marrying other kinds of people and having strangelooking kids but the important thing is she was nice enough to marry even if i never wouldnt do it there are lots of cheap women in japan but there are cheap women in san diego and chicago so that dont mean nothing but this girl she was nice i met her when we were sitting at the same table at a little joint for lunch and i couldnt get the waitress to bring me no napkin and she explained to me that i should use that towel they bring you like a napkin stupid of me huh not to figure that out myself and we got to talking and i learned she worked in a department store the takaysomethingorother and i told her how i was in the navy for ten years and had never been married and such and she told me how she liked to talk with americans and learn about america and democracy and hollywood and like that now i seen my chance to do something for democracy no bull i know it sounds like bull but it aint you probably figure i was looking for a quick lay but i can tell you that i can get one of those without hardly trying but a nice girl is different i figured if i could help her learn more about democracy and she could tell her friends and they could tell their friends you know that kind of thing can do international relations a lot more good than speechmaking and stuff so i made a date to meet her for an afternoon movie the next day on account of her father wouldnt let her go out at night and maybe wouldnt let her go out with no american sailor only i never knew for sure i figured we could have something to drink or maybe a sandwich and a coke after the movie and i could talk to her about democrary and chalk up a couple of marks for uncle sam of course at the time i didnt realize how a person can think they like democracy and not understand it like americans do the movie was real good we went to one of those samery things and she explained to me what was happening only it was so simple it didnt take no explaining about some big shot with the front part of his hair shaved oif who gets himself killed and a bunch of guys that work for him swear theyll get even for him and they take years but they kill the guy that killed the first guy and then they give themselves up because they committed a crime and finally they all kill themselves but in an honorable way its like the japs you know to worry about honorable dying and other kinds of dying and the difference is very important after the movie we went out for coffee only it was so strong i couldnt drink it until i put some water in because she really goes for coffee i guess the japs have been drinking tea so long they really dig coffee when they can get it then she asked me about america and i really told her just like i was a damned histcry teacher i told her about the war we fought against england to be free and the war we fought against the south so that the niggers wouldnt be slaves no more and about how california and texas got settled and the pioneers and all this girl she ate it up so we made a date for another movie the next saturday the next time we seen john wayne in that thing about the alamo because i thought it would help her understand american history how the americans fought the greasers and how all the heroes died in the alamo but how america finally won the war and captured texas and afterwards i explained more to her about democracy the way she listened and smiled and shook her head up and down i was positive she understood me shows how wrong a guy can be this time i explained how everyone is equal and everyone can vote if he keeps out of jail i told her every man is as good as every other man like we got jewgovernors and a chinaman in the senate and i think we got a jap in the senate too and thats the next thing to being president i told her about how the navy got jews and italians as officers and that even an american like me has to salute these guys and say sir to them and thats real democracy and i talked about how the old navy used to keep niggers for just certain kinds of job but not the new navy nosir i must of talked nearly two hours and she kept asking questions and her eyes would open big like when i talked about the jap fellow in the senate and i could see she thought a lot better about the us but you know there are little things that you can understand only when you live in a place awhile and no matter how much you explain something a person who never lived there will never understand it well the thing that happened to me with this girl is a real good example of what i mean like im not criticizing her because she didnt know better but it shows what the lieutenant means when he says there are cultural differences between americans and japanese the third time i show up to meet her i can see shes talking to some navy guy i dont get jealous because were just friends and if some guy wants to date her more serious than me why i think he should when i come up to her she introduces me to this guy and goddamned if he isnt a nigger well i smile and shake hands with him like he was anyone else ive buddied with some swell niggers around the base and i dont have that kind of prejudices but when her and i get to the coffee place later i try to explain how nice girls dont get too mixed up with niggers like she should talk with them and be friendly and all because thats democracy but she shouldnt be too friendly or theyll ask her for a date and then she has to say no and everybody gets embarrassed then she tells me the guy already asked her for a date and she said all right and she hoped i wouldnt be mad because i told her i had a girl friend in san diego i told her that so as she wouldnt fall in love with me so i tried to explain to her that dating a nigger just isnt done so she asked me some dumb questions and they were so dumb i couldnt answer them you know the kind i mean she asked if everyone is equal why shouldnt everyone be equal to date and she asked if i was so proud of freeing the coloreds from being slaves why wasnt i proud of being in the navy with them and if niggers were ensigns and petty officers why shouldnt she date one because maybe some day hed be a ensign or a petty officer i guess she asked a lotta other questions but i dont remember because like i said they were the kind of questions you would expect from a foreigner who was just learning about democracy i shipped out after that and i never saw her again but i did get one letter from her she said she wasnt dating the colored sailor no more but he introduced her to another colored guy who was a captain in the air force and she thanked me for teaching her so much about democracy and said she understood the problems of democracy better from me than from all the books she ever read like i say the japs are a very nice people and i got lots of respect for them but there are some things about democracy the little differences that are really big differences that they just dont understand maestro dean dixon by walter monfried he cannot find a steady job in his native land dean dixon the american conductor has been traveling around the world in the last years and winning its acclaim the audiences and critics of most european nations and of israel and australia have been unanimous in their praises of the likable undemonstrative maestro from harlem in recent years he has made nis headquarters in frankfort on the main an ancient cultural and commercial centerthe home of goethe the poet schopenhauer the philosopher and the bankers rothschild there he spends four months a year in the other eight months he speeds by plane or his own little car to the major orchestras of many capitals recently he was appointed permanent leader of the symphony orchestra of sydney australia a metropolis of because of his numerous commitments he will conduct only for short periods in sydney until march when he will begin his first full term the australian newspapers report that the music public there is pleased by the appointment says the sydney morning herald concertgoers became aware at dixons first concerts here last november that he was a conductor worth waiting for unobtrusively commanding on the concert platform with a beat and gestures that were free from unnecessary emphasis he at once established a quiet unforced emphasis over orchestra and audience in his series of mozart concerts he proved himself one of the finest mozart interpreters in the world today he a master of the beethoven idiom his reading of sibelius was as truthful to the character of the music as if he had been reared in finland the birthplace of his exceptionally able wife herself a playwright she is a baroness and the second mrs dixon his former wife is an american there are three dixon children martin long a leading australian critic writes dixon looks like a good man for the task on all counts he is a first rate conductor who already has proved his ability to vitalize this orchestra charles dean dixon the son of immigrants from the west indies was born in new york years ago his mother set him to studying the violin early he loathed the practicing and purposely broke strings she always had a few extras until one day he found and cut them all now you just sit here for four hours doing nothing she ordered the boy sat it out and decided that it was worse than practicing when he was his violin teacher told deans mother your boy has no talent then i guess well hae him become a doctor she reflected and added firmly but hes not giving up his music in his public school music courses he learned to play every instrument of the orchestra when he was in high school he organized an amateur orchestra in a harlem ymca basement its concerts were so well received that the head of the high school music department urged him to become a professional by this time he could play the violin well enough to win a scholarship at the famed juilliard institute and for seven years he studied there and at columbia university he didnt give up his neighborhood orchestra and eventually men women boys and girls were playing with him all for fun friends came to his financial aid and the dean dixon symphony concerts became prideful events in the district ticket sales met most of the expenses persons without money were admitted free an official of the national broadcasting co heard the orchestra and dixon then in his early twenties received some substantial assignments as guest conductor as a leader of the national youth administration orchestra in the s he enhanced his reputation in a few students of city college of new york asked dixon to enroll them in a new orchestra and lead themwithout pay of course that was the start of the amercan youth orchestra a vigorous and proficient outfit which operating on a minimal budget won the nations admiration within a few months it had nearly members and gave to concerts a year some of them in carnegie hall but most of them in the new york poorer neighborhoods where most residents never had a chance to hear good live music we never failed to win an audience dixon recalled as soon as we finished playing the people would crowd around us and ask when will you be back a dean dixon concert was not an ordinary exhibition before going into a neighborhood to give a concert he had the entire community prepare for it he formed a dozen committees to type and mimeograph the circulars and pro grams to distribute the tickets to deliver chairs and other equipment and so on that made it really their event in the s he became an outstanding educator too he taught conducting at juilliard and worked with many young peoples groups on music making and appreciation in he led several hundred wisconsin pupils in the annual summer music clinic at madison he worked them as they had never been worked before and they took it with a smile and a demand for more every day they had to play a new piece the average person isnt going to become a heifetz or rubinstein so why work for six long months on one long masterpeice he argued let him work on many masterpieces do you spend six months reading one book a man of quiet speech and mild manners he had a way in handling youngsters to a boisterous or talkative youth he said play your part from beginning to end alone when this was done he told the lad now you can talk while we play in one of his classes the students took turns at leading an orchestra one youth had an exalted opinion of his own genius and took no care to conceal it just before that boys turn on the podium dixon quietly told some of the players to tune their instruments a half interval below the others the vain boy directed the entire number without noticing the odd harmonies after he was told of the discrepancy in the pitch he was a more subdued student dixon himself has a phenomenally acute ear when he holds auditions he turns his back to the candidates he doesnt care what they look like he wants to know only how they play at times he has told an unseen aspirant that violin youre playingdidnt someone else play it yesterday the answer was yes although he was guest conductor of many leading american orchestras he received no offers of a full time post and in he moved to paris and then to sweden where he led the goteborg orchestra then he began to extend his career over the continent at the venice summer festival of he became a sensation the venetians who came out of curiosity remained to cheer the critic of ii gazettino a difficult man to please praised the dixon technical precision values in his first two years in europe he performed american works by composers such as charles ives and wallingford riegger who were unknown abroad two years ago he was named general director of the hessian radio orchestra of frankfort in his first season the reviewers noted that he caused the musicians to play as if transformed today the end of his long absence from his native land does not seem near but eventually he hopes he will return as the leader of his own orchestra george washington northwest city builder by bob karolevitz he state of washington is named after the nations first president but another george washington son of a slave and jackofalltrades was one of the most prominent and successful pioneers of the pacific ris northwest commonwealth the george washington who came west founded a bustling city made a small fortune in real estate and otherwise conquered the odds which were with him from the start his life ran the gamut of a youthful struggle for education the hardships of the frontier the stinging rebuffs of prejudice and the ultimate warm glow of success fortunate circumstances and his own great courage helped him to break through the onyx curtain of his generation and to achieve the wealth and stature denied to so many other negroes of the th century george was born on august in historic frederick county virginia he received his surname from his fathers master and some students of the past have speculated that the washingtons involved might have been closely related to the gallant general of mount vernon the youngster was just a baby when his father was sold to a new owner and tiny george was taken into the home of mr and mrs james e cochrane this white couple ultimately adopted him a move which later subjected the cochranes to a great deal of ridicule in that era of racial bitterness when the boy was four the cochranes moved to the ohio frontier and later on into northern missouri because of his color young washington was denied formal schooling but mrs cochrane proved to be a better teacher than he might have found in an organized classroom with a tattered bible and old hymnals as textbooks she taught him to read she and her husband tutored him in arithmetic too and before he was george could mentally compute land measures faster than his contemporaries could get the answers with a pencil stub while the tecumseh plot for a grand western indian alliance had been foiled years before by william henry harrison at tippecanoe george washington grew up in an atmosphere of ready alert jim cochrane saw to it that he became an expert with a rifle because the possibilities of hostile indian attack were always imminent in bloomington mo cochrane operated a grist mill and a whiskey distillery later he opened a sawmill not only did george washingtons alert teenage mind soak up the rudiments of these trades but he also learned bricklaying and tailoring when he was george decided to strike out on his own after a short time in illinois during which he failed to make his fortune in the real estate business washington rented a sawmill near the present city of st joseph mo it was hereaway from the cochranesthat he first learned the real meaning of prejudice he sold some goods to a white man named jeremiah coyle whose note he accepted in good faith when the note came due coyle refused to pay and washington sued coyle then took advantage of an earlier law and had george arrested on the grounds that as a free man of color he had no rights in the state of missouri jim cochrane heard of his adopted sons plight and immediately circulated a petition requesting the rights of citizenship for the young man in the legislature granted those rightsless that of holding public office in the meantime the mill he had operated flooded out so washington purchased equipment to make whiskey then the legislature which had so recently aided him passed another law this one prohibiting a person of color from manufacturing handling or selling spirituous liquors washington disgustedly moved to quincy ill already severely irritated by the limitations placed on him in missouri he learned that the illinois legislature had just passed a law requiring any colored person entering that state with intentions of staying must post a bond of to guarantee his good behavior this was more than george could stand he went directly to the cochranes and told them that he was going to oregon to find a place in the world if there was any where a negro would be treated as a man his foster parents decided that theyd go too with a wagon and a light carriage four oxen two span of horses and several canadian ponies they went first to council bluffs iowa on may they set out with a wagon train on the long overland journey a story has it that on the trip a triggerhappy renegade in their party shot an indian squaw a war party threatened annihilation of the wagon train unless the villain was surrendered being at the mercy of the indians the travelers had little choice but to hand over the slayer and then they watched aghast as the indians skinned him alive and threw his body in a fire the journey took days before the party crossed the cascade range at barlows pass and arrived in oregon city washington helped the cochranes establish a home and then took a job cutting timber for a month the rigors of the trip the new climate and the hard work finally caught up with the yearold frontiersman and he fell desperately ill again it was the cochranes who came to his rescue and nursed him back to health with george strong again the family moved northward to cowlitz landing in the present state of washington again the young man helped his foster parents get settled before he looked for a home of his own his search finally took him to a verdant spot where the skookumchuck river joins the chehalis this had been an indian summer home and burial grounds and from his earlier real estate experience washington had learned that the juncture of two rivers made an ideal spot for settlement he immediately staked a claim for acres then he learned that prejudice had marched westward with him the oregon legislature had approved a law making the settlement of negroes and mulattos in the territory illegal so jim cochrane filed on washingtons land to protect it for him together they raised cattle and operated an inn and a river ferry in the same year that oregon became a state jim cochrane died only the death of mrs cochrane two years later affected washington more deeply they had devoted their lifetime to the care of a deserted negro youngster and the recipient of their love and devotion recognized all too well the sacrifices their choice in life had entailed before cochrane died george had given him for the original claim when the laws of washington territory created in did not bar ownership by a negro he later added more acres to the original holdings by filing a claim and paying an acre with his foster parents gone washington lived alone for several yearsfarming lumbering and improving his land when he was he met and married his first wife an attractive widow who had been born of negro and jewish parents this was a happy union of years before she died in meanwhile the two of them began to reap the rewards of georges foresight by the northern pacific railroad had edged northward to the chehalis river and the homestead which george washington had so carefully selected lay right astride the line on january washington appeared before the territorial auditor and filed his intentions of laying out a new town he started modestly with four square blocks which he platted into lots ft by ft these he sold for a lot at the same time making each purchaser agree to erect a building on the property at a cost of no less than to counter the rivalry of other young towns in the territory washington who controlled all the ideal property set aside park land and two acres for a cemetery he dedicated foot streets and foot alleys for public use and he gave choice building lots for churches of his holdings he reserved acres for his home with mary jane and her son stacey to make the town of centerville more attractive to new residents washington later doubled the size of his lots and the little village began to grow by the time washington became a state in the population was nearing a thousand two years later george washington had sold his th lot and combined with his other incomes he had amassed meanwhile the residents of washingtons town decided that they didnt like the name centerville primarily because it was too easy to confuse with other western towns of the same name a public meeting was called and a teamster newly arrived from centralia ill convinced the citizens that they should adopt the name of his former hometown in following the death of his first wife washington married charity brown a year later his only child george cleveland washington was bom soon afterwards the couple separated and the yearold father assumed the additional task of raising a son george washington had always worked hard and even though he had a great deal of money by the standards of the times he continued to do manual labor when it was called for he had personally hewn the timbers for the centralia baptist church to which he belonged and he worked on numerous construction projects around the busy little city and then came the panic of like other young western settlements centralia took on the aura of a ghost town the simmons iron works and the lumber mills shut down or curtailed employment severely to save the town george washington became a oneman relief society he made wagon trips to portland and brought back rice flour and sugar by the ton from the packing plant in chehalis he purchased large quantities of side bacon and lard as a man who could still make a shirt in an hourandahalf including buttons and buttonholes he worked to provide clothing and shoes for his less fortunate neighbors he lent considerable sums of money without interest and with no terms for repayment but mainly he provided work so that his beneficiaries did not accept his offerings as pridedamaging charity but as an exchange for a days labor washington further saved the town from bankruptcy or absentee ownership by buying up property which went on the auction block his faith in his city paid off in when the tide changed not only for centralia but for george washington too by the turn of the century he was a wealthy and respected citizen of the state alert and always planning for the future in spite of his age washington was active in business until august of then in an accident not uncommon in those days he was thrown from his buggy by a runaway horse and injured critically three weeks later on august he died in his th year his funeral was the biggest in centralias history as the mayor proclaimed a day of mourning services were help in the baptist church he helped to build on the ground he had donated he was buried in the cemetery he had deeded to the city beside him were the bodies of james cochrane and his wife whom george had thoughtfully moved to the family plot with the help of his devoted foster parents washington had risen above the limitations set for his race in an era of prejudice and injustice today he is virtually a legendary figure in his city and his adopted state stories are told about his strong aversion to paper money which grew folks say out of the time he saw a bill blow into a roaring fireplace after that he dealt only in gold and silver once he supposedly withdrew a wheelbarrow full of money from a local bank when he became fearful of the banks soundness it is still rumored that he buried the money somewhere around centralia and never told anyone of the location in his later years he was still sharpeyed and adept with a rifle and could riddle a tin can tossed into the air with a revolver his only vanity consisted of two wigs a brown one for week days and a black one for sunday though his stature in his home community was great he did not entirely escape the reminders of his lowly birth today one of centralias streets grew out of a conflict with one of his neighbors james tullis a southerner tullis vowed that his fence would never touch washingtons so he erected it six feet inside his own property not to be outdone george also built his fence six feet from the plat line and the resultant foot spite strip became known as tullis lane george washington pioneer builder and entrepreneurmight have been handicapped by his borrowed name his color and his backwoods education but he chose to accent the positive today a thriving city stands as a living monument to his long struggle against moralecracking odds hed have preferred that to statues by dwight macdonald his significantly titled the affluent society pro fessor j k galbraith states that poverty in this country is no longer a massive affliction but more nearly an after thought dr galbraith is a humane critic of the american capitalist system and he is generously indignant about the con tinued existence of even this nonmassive and afterthoughtish poverty but the interesting thing about his pronouncement aside from the fact that it is inaccurate is that it was generally accepted as obvious for a long time now almost everybody has assumed that because of the new deals social legislation and more inportantthe prosperity we have enjoyed since mass poverty no longer exists in this country dr galbraith states that our poor have dwindled to two hardcore categories one is the insular poverty of those who live in the rural south or in depressed areas like west virginia the other category is case poverty which he says is commonly and properly related to such characteristics of the individuals so afflicted as mental deficiency bad health inability to adapt to the discipline of modern economic life excessive procreation alcohol insufficient education he reasons that such poverty must be due to individual defects since nearly everyone else has mastered his environment this proves that it is not intractable without pressing the similarity of this concept to the social darwinism whose fallacies dr galbraith easily disposes of elsewhere in his book one may observe that most of these characteristics are as much the result of poverty as its cause dr galbraiths error is understandable and common last april the newspapers reported some exhilarating statistics in a department of commerce study the average family income increased from in to in these figures are calculated in current dollars as are all the others i shall cite but the papers did not report the fine type so to speak which showed that almost all the recent gain was made by families with income of over and that the rate at which poverty is being eliminated has slowed down alarmingly since only the specialists and the statisticians read the fine type which is why illusions continue to exist about american poverty now michael harrington an alumnus of the catholic worker and the fund for the republic who is at present a contributing editor of dissent and the chief editor of the socialist party biweekly new america has written the other america poverty in the united states macmillan in the admirably short space of under two hundred pages he outlines the problem describes in imaginative detail what it means to be poor in this country today summarizes the findings of recent studies by economists and sociologists and analyzes the reasons for the persistence of mass poverty in the midst of general prosperity in the last year we seem to have suddenly awakened rubbing our eyes like rip van winkle to the fact that mass poverty persists and that it is one of our two gravest social problems the other is related while only eleven per centof our population is nonwhite twentyfive per cent of our poor are what is poverty it is a historically relative concept first of all there are new definitions in america of what man can achieve of what a human standard of life should be mr harrington writes those who suffer levels of life well below those that are possible even though they live better than medieval knights or asian peasants are poor poverty should be defined in terms of those who are denied the minimal levels of health housing food and education that our present stage of scientific knowledge specifies for life as it is now lived in the united states his dividing line follows that proposed in recent studies by the united states bureau of labor statistics a year for a family of four and for an individual living alone all kinds of income are included such as food grown and consumed on farms this is the cutoff line generally drawn today mr harrington estimates that between forty and fifty million americans or about a fourth of the population are now living in poverty not just below the level of comfortable living but real poverty in the oldfashioned sense of the wordthat they are hard put to it to get the mere necessities beginning with enough to eat this is difficult to believe in the united states of but one has to make the effort and it is now being made the extent of our poverty has sud denly become visible the same thing has happened in england where workingclass gains as a result of the labour partys post welfare state blinded almost everybody to the continued existence of mass poverty it was not until professor richard m titmuss of the london school of economics published a series of articles in the new statesman last fall based on his new book income distribution and social change allen unwin that even the liberal public in england became aware that the problem still persists on a scale that is statistically significant as the economists put it the limits of statistics statistics on poverty are even trickier than most for example age and geography make a difference there is a distinction which cannot be rendered arithmetically between poverty and low income a childless young couple with a year is not poor in the way an elderly couple might be with the same income the young couples statistical poverty may be temporary inconvenience if the husband is a graduate student or a skilled worker there are prospects of later affluence or at least comfort but the old couple can look forward only to diminishing earnings and increasing medical expenses so also geographically a family of four in a small town with a year may be better off than a like family in a citylower rent no bus fares to get to work fewer occasions or temptations to spend money even more so with a rural family although allowance is made for the value of the vegetables they may raise to feed themselves it is impossible to calculate how much money they dont spend on clothes say or furniture because they dont have to keep up with the joneses lurking in the crevices of a city like piranha fish in a brazilian stream are numerous tempting opportunities for expenditure small but voracious which can strip a budget to its bones in a surprisingly short time how many poor it is not therefore surprising to find that there is some disagreement about just how many millions of americans are poor the point is that all recent studies agree that american poverty is still a mass phenomenon thus the commerce departments april report estimates there are families and unattached individuals with incomes of less than how many of the latter are there poverty and deprivation see page puts the number of single persons with under at let us say that in the under there are single personsthe proportion of unattached individuals tends to go down as income rises this homemade estimate gives us familes with incomes of under figuring the average american family at thiee and a half personswhich it isthis makes individuals in families or a grand total if we add in the unattached individuals with under a year of americans now living in poverty which is close to a fourth of the total population the reason dr galbraith was able to see poverty as no longer a massive affliction is that he used a cutoff of which even in when it was adopted in a congressional study was probably too low the cio argued for and in when the affluent society appeared was simply fantastic the model postwar budgets drawn up in by the bureau of labor statistics to maintain a level of adequate living give a concrete idea of what poverty means in this countryor would mean if poor families lived within their income and spent it wisely which they dont dr kolko summarizes the kind of living these budgets provide three members of the family see a movie once every three weeks and one member sees a movie once every two weeks there is no telephone in the house but the family makes three pay calls a week they buy one book a year and write one letter a week the father buys one heavy wool suit every two years and a light wool suit every three years the wife one suit every ten years or one skirt every five years every three or four years depending on the distance and time involved the family takes a vacation outside their own city in the family spent a total of to on all types of home furnishings electrical appliances and laundry equipment the family eats cheaper cuts of meat several times a week but has more expensive cuts on holidays the entire family consumes a total of two fivecent ice cream cones one fivecent candy bar two bottles of soda and one bottle of beer a week the family owes no money but has no savings except for a small insurance policy one other item is included in the bls maintenance budget a new car every twelve to eighteen years this is an ideal picture drawn up by social workers of how a poor family should spend its money but the poor are much less provident installment debts take up a lot of their cash and only a statistician could expect an actual live woman however poor to buy new clothes at intervals of five or ten years also one suspects that a lot more movies are seen and icecream cones and bottles of beer are consumed than in the spartan ideal but these necessary items are had only at the cost of displacing other itemsnecessary so to speakin the bls budget the conference on economic progresss poverty and deprivation deals not only with the poor but also with another large section of the underprivileged which is an american euphemism almost as good as senior citizen namely the persons whose family income is between and and the singles who have from to the authors define deprivation as above poverty but short of minimum requirements for a modestly comfortable level of living they claim that americans or almost half the population live in poverty or deprivation one recalls the furor roosevelt aroused with his onethird of a nation illhoused illclad illnourished but the political climate was different then the distinction between a family income of poverty and deprivation is not vivid to those who run thingsthe per cent whose incomes are between and and the per cent of the topmost top dogs who get or more these two minorities sizable enough to feel they are the nation have been as unaware of the continued existence of mass poverty as this reviewer was until he read mr harringtons book they are businessmen congressmen judges government officials politicians lawyers doctors engineers scientists editors journalists and administrators in colleges churches and foundations since their education income and social status are superior they if anybody might be expected to accept responsibility for what the constitution calls the general welfare they have not done so in the case of the poor and they have a good excuse it is becoming harder and harder simply to see the onefourth of our fellowcitizens who live below the poverty line the poor are increasingly slipping out of the very experience and consciousness of the nation mr harrington writes if the middle class never did like ugliness and poverty it was at least aware of them across the tracks was not a very long way to go now the american city has been transformed the poor still inhabit the miserable housing in the central area but they are increasingly isolated from contact with or sight of anybody else living out in the suburbs it is easy to assume that ours is indeed an affluent society clothes make the poor invisible too america has the bestdressed poverty the world has ever known it is much easier in the united states to be decently dressed than it is to be decently housed fed or doctored many of the poor are the wrong age to be seen a good number of them are sixtyfive years of age or better an even larger number are under eighteen and finally the poor are politically invisible they are without lobbies of their own they put forward no legislative program as a group they are atomized they have no face they have no voice only the social agencies have a really direct involvement with the other america and they are without any great political power forty to fifty million people are becoming increasingly invisible these invisible people fall mostly into the following categories some of them overlapping poor farmers who operate per cent of the farms and get per cent of the farm cash income migratory farm workers unskilled unorganized workers in offices hotels restaurants hospitals laundries and other service jobs inhabitants of areas where poverty is either endemic peculiar to a people or district as in the rural south or epidemic prevalent among a community at a special time and produced by some special causes as in west virginia where the special cause was the closing of coal mines and steel plants negroes and puerto ricans who are a fourth of the total poor the alcoholic derelicts in the bigcity skid rows the hillbillies from kentucky tennessee and oklahoma who have migrated to midwestern cities in search of better jobs and finally almost half our senior citizens the wrong color the most obvious citizens of the other america are those whose skins are the wrong color the folk slogans are realistic last to be hired first to be fired and if youre black stay back there has been some progress in the nonwhite workers wage averaged per cent of the white workers by it had climbed to per cent a famous victory but the nonwhites still average only slightly more than half as much as the whites even this modest gain was due not to any rooseveltian or trumanian social reform but merely to the fact that for some years there was a war on and workers were in demand whether black white or violet by the nonwhites had achieved most of their advanceto per cent of white earnings which means they have gained in the last fifteen years just per cent the least obvious poverty affects our senior citizensthose over sixtyfive mr harrington estimates that half of them live in poverty and he thinks they are even more atomized and politically helpless than the rest of the other america he estimates that onefourth of the unrelated individuals among them or a million persons have less than a year which is about what is allotted for food alone in the department of agricultures minimumsubsistence budget the average american family now spends only per cent of its income for foodan indication of the remarkable prosperity we are all enjoying except for onequarter of us one can imagine or perhaps one cant what it would be like to live on a year or a week it is only fair to note that most of our senor citizens do better the average per capita income of those over sixtyfive is now estimated to be slightly over a week that is a year the aged poor have two sources of income besides their earnings or savings one is contributions by relatives a white house conference report put this at per cent of income which works out to a week for an income of and the aged poor all have less than that the other is social security whose benefits in averaged a week even this modest sum is more than any of the under got since payments are proportionate to earnings and the poor of course earned less than the rest a quarter of them and those in general the neediest are not covered by social security the last resort is relief and mr harrington describes most vividly the humiliations the poor often have to put up with to get that the whole problem of poverty and the aged is especially serious today because americans are living longer in the first half of this century life expectancy increased years for men and years for women and between and the oversixtyfive group increased twice as fast as the population as a whole the worst part of being old and poor in this country is the loneliness mr harrington notes that we have not only racial ghettos but geriatric ones in the cheap roominghouse districts of large cities he gives one peculiarly disturbing statistic onethird of the aged in the united states some or more human beings have no phone in their place of residence they are literally cut off from the rest of america ernest hemingways celebrated deflation of scott fitzgeralds romantic notion that the rich are different somehowyes they have moneydoesnt apply to the poor they are different in more important ways than their lack of money as mr harrington demonstrates emotional upset is one of the main forms of the vicious circle of impoverishment the structure of the society is hostile to these people the poor tend to become pessimistic and depressed they seek immediate gratification instead of saving they act out once this mood this unarticulated philosophy becomes a fact society can change the recession can end and yet there is no motive for movement the depression has become internalized the middle class looks upon this process and sees lazy people who just dont want to get ahead people who are much too sensitive to demand of cripples that they run races ask of the poor that they get up and act like everyone else in the society the poor are not like everyone else they think and feel differently they look upon a different america than the middle class looks upon the poor are also different in a physical sense they are much less healthy according to poverty and deprivation the proportion of those disabled or limited in their major activity by chronic ill health rises sharply as income sinks in reasonably welloff families and up per cent are so disabled in reasonably poor families to the proportion doubles to per cent and in unreasonably poor familes under it doubles again to per cent an obvious cause among others for the very poor being four times as much disabled by chronic ill health as the welltodo is that they have much less money to spend for medical care in fact almost nothing this weighs with special heaviness on the aged poor during the fifties mr harrington notes all costs on the consumer price index went up by per cent but medical costs that terrible staple of the aged went up by per cent hospitalization rose by per cent and group hospitalization costs blue cross premiums were up by per cent the defeat of medicare this last figure is particularly interesting since blue cross and such plans are the amas alternative to socialized medicine or rather to the timid fumblings toward it that even our most liberal politicians have dared to propose such figures throw an unpleasant light on the senates rejection of medicare the defeat was all the more bitter because in the usual effort to appease the conservatives with the usual lack of successonly five republicans and only four southern democrats voted pro the bill was watered down in advance not until he had spent of his own moneywhich is per cent of the annual income of some aged poorwould a patient have been eligible and the original program included only people already covered by social security or railroad retirement pensions and excluded the neediest of all aged poor who are left out of both these systems mental as well as physical illness is much greater among the poor even though our complacent cliche is that nervous breakdowns are a prerogative of the rich because the poor cant afford them they cant but they have them anyway this bit of middleclass folklore should be laid to rest by a study made in new haven social class and mental illness by august b hollingshead and frederick c redlich wiley they found that the rate of treated psychiatric illness is about the same from the rich down through decently paid workersan average of per but in the bottom fifth it shoots up to per there is an even more striking difference in the kind of mental illness of those in the four top in come groups who had undergone psychiatric treatment per cent had been treated for neurotic problems and per cent for psychotic disturbances in the bottom fifth the treated illnesses were almost all psychotic per cent this shows there is something to the notion that the poor cant afford nervous breakdownsthe milder kind that issince the reason the proportion of treated neuroses among the poor is only per cent is that a neurotic can keep going after a fashion but the argument cuts deeper the other way the poor go to a psychiatrist or more commonly are committed to a mental institution only when they are completely unable to function because of psychotic symptoms therefore even that nearly threefold increase in mental disorders among the poor is probably an underestimate the main reason the american poor have become invisible is that since their numbers have been reduced by twothirds astounding as it may seem the fact is that president roosevelts onethird of a nation was a considerable understatement over twothirds of us then lived below the poverty line as is shown by the tables that follow but today the poor are a minority and minorities can be ig nored if they are so heterogeneous that they cannot be organized when the poor were a majority they simply could not be overlooked poverty is also hard to see today because the middle class to has vastly increasedfrom per cent of all families in to a nearmajority per cent today that mass poverty can persist despite this rise to affluence is hard to believe or see especially if one is among those who have risen two tables in poverty and deprivation summarize what has been happening in the last thirty years they cover only multipleperson families all figures are converted to dollars and the income is before taxes i have omitted for clarity all fractions the first table is the percentage of families with a given income under to to to over several interesting conclusions can be drawn from these tables the new deal didnt do anything about poverty the under families in were per cent of the total population which was slightly more than the figure of per cent the war economy hot and cold did do something about poverty between and the proportion of all families who were poor reduced from per cent to per cent if the percentage of under families decreased by twothirds between and their share of the national income dropped a great deal morefrom per cent to per cent the welltodo to have enormously increased from per cent of all families in to per cent today the rich and over have also multipliedfrom to per cent but it should be noted that the very rich according to another new study the share of top wealthholders in national wealth by robert j lampman princeton have experienced a decline he finds that the top per cent of wealthholders owned per cent of the national wealth in and own only per cent today the reduction of poverty has slowed down in the six years the number of poor families declined per cent but in the following seven years only per cent the economic stasis that set in with eisenhower and that still persists under kennedy was responsible this stagnation however did not affect the over families who increased from per cent to per cent between and in the new york times magazine for last november th herman p miller of the bureau of the census wrote during the forties the lowerpaid occupations made the greatest relative gains in average income laborers and service workers had increases of about and professional and managerial workers the highest paid workers of all had the lowest relative gains but in the last decade the trend has been reversed laborers and service workers have gained while professionalmanagerial workers have gained this is because in the wartime forties the unskilled were in great demand while now they are being replaced by machines automation is today the same kind of menace to the unskilledthat is the poorthat the enclosure movement was to the british agricultural population centuries ago the facts show that our social revolution ended nearly twenty years ago mr miller concludes yet important segments of the american public many of them highly placed government officials and prominent educators think and act as though it were a continuing process the post decrease in poverty was not due to the policies or actions of those who are not poor those in positions of power and responsibility the war economy needed workers wages went up and the poor became less poor when economic stasis set in the rate of decrease in poverty slowed down proportionately and it is still slow kennedys efforts to get the country moving again has been unsuccessful possibly because he has despite the suggestions of many of his economic advisers not yet advocated the one big step that might push the economy off dead center a massive increase in government spending this would be politically courageous perhaps even dangerous because of the superstitious fear of deficit spending and an unbalanced federal budget american folklore insists that a governments budget must be arranged like a private familys walter lippmann wrote after the collapse of the stock market last spring there is mounting evidence that those economists were right who told the administration last winter that it was making the mistake of trying to balance the budget too soon it will be said that the budget is not balanced it shows a deficit in fiscal of billion but the budget that matters is the department of commerces income and product accounts budget nobody looks at it except the economists but while the administrative budget is necessary for administration and is like a mans checkbook the income budget tells the real story it shows that at the end of the outgo and ingo accounts will be virtually in balance with a deficit of only about half a billion dollars thus in reality the kennedy administration is no longer stimulating the economy and the economy is stagnating for lack of stimulation we have one of the lowest rates of growth among the advanced industrial nations of the world one shouldnt be hard on the president franklin roosevelt a more daring and experimental politician at least in his domestic policy listened to the american disciples of j m keynes in the early new deal years and unbalanced his budgets with splendid results but by he had lost his nerve he cut back government spending and there ensued the recession from which the economy recovered only when war orders began to make up for the deficiency in domestic buying power poverty and deprivation estimates that between and the annual growth rate of our economy was only per cent per annum contrasted with an estimated per cent required to maintain utilization of manpower and other productive resources the poor who always experience the worst the first understand quite personally the meaning of that dry statistic as they understand kiplings the toad beneath the harrow knowsexactly where each toothpoint goes they are also most intimately acquainted with another set of statistics the steady postwar rise in the unemployment rate from per cent in to per cent in to per cent in to over per cent in the tory government is worried because british unemployment is now at its highest point for the last three years this point is per cent which is less than our lowest rate in the last fifteen years its not that public opinion doesnt become aroused every now and then but the arousement never leads to much it was aroused twentyfour years ago when john steinbeck published the grapes of wrath but mr harrington reports that things in the imperial valley are still much the same low wages bad housing no effective union public opinion is too public that is too general of its very nature it can have no sustained interest in california agriculture the only groups with such a continuing interest are the workers and the farmers who hire them once public opinion ceased to be aroused the battle was again between the two antagonists with a real personal stake in the outcome and there was no question about which was stronger so with the rural poor in general in the late fifties the average annual wage for white male american farm worker was slightly over women children negroes and mexicans got less one recalls edward r murrows celebrated television program about these people harvest of shame once more everybody was shocked but the harvest is still shameful one also recalls that mr murrow after president kennedy had appointed him head of the united states information agency tried to persuade the bbc not to show harvest of shame his argument was that it would give an undesirable image of america to foreign audiences there is a monotony about the injustices suffered by the poor that perhaps accounts for the lack of interest the rest of society shows in them everything seems to go wrong with them they never win its just boring address unknown public housing turns out not to be for them the housing act authorized new units of lowcost housing in the following four years twelve years later in the aflcio proposed units to complete the lagging program the kennedy administration ventured to recommend to congress thus instead of lowcost units by the poor will get if they are lucky by and they are more likely to be injured than helped by slum clearance since the new projects usually have higher rents than the displaced slumdwellers can afford there has been no dearth of governmentfinanced middle income housing since these refugees from the bulldozers for the most part simply emigrate to other slums they also become invisible mr harrington notes that half of them are recorded as address unknown several years ago charles abrams who was new york state rent administrator under harriman and who is now president of the national committee against discrimination in housing summed up what he had learned in two decades in public housing once social reforms have won tonal appeal in the public mind their slogans and goalsymbols may degenerate into tools of the dominant class for beleaguering the minority and often for defeating the very aims which the original sponsors had intended for their reforms and this is not the end of tribulation the poor who can least afford to lose pay because of ill health lose the most a national health survey made a few years ago found that workers earning under a year had twice as many restrictedactivity days as those earning over although they are the most in need of hospital insurance the poor have the least since they cant afford the premiums only per cent of poor families have it as against per cent of all families it should be noted however that the poor who are war veterans can get free treatment at government expense in veterans administration hospitals the poor actually pay more taxes in proportion to their income than the rich a recent study by the tax foundation estimates that per cent of incomes under goes for taxes as against per cent of the income of families earning five to seven times as much sales and other excise taxes are largely responsible for this curious statistic it is true that such taxes fall impartially on all like the blessed rain from heaven but it is a form of egalitarianism that perhaps only senator goldwater can fully appreciate the final irony is that the welfare state which roosevelt erected and which eisenhower no matter how strongly he felt about it didnt attempt to pull down is not for the poor either agricultural workers are not covered by social security nor are many of the desperately poor among the aged such as unrelated individuals with incomes of less than of whom only per cent are covered which is just half the percentage of coverage among the aged in general of the welfare state mr harrington says its creation had been stimulated by mass impoverishment and misery yet it helped the poor least of all laws like unemployment compensation the wagner act the various farm programs all these were designed for the middle third in the cities for the organized workers and for the big market farmers it benefits those least who need help most the industrial workers led by john l lewis mobilized enough political force to put through section a of the national industrial recovery act which with the wagner act made the cio possible the big farmers put enough pressure on henry wallace roosevelts first secretary of agriculturewho talked a good fight for liberal principles but was a hamlet when it came to actionto establish the two basic propositions of welfare state agriculture subsidies that now cost billion a year and that chiefly benefit the big farmers and the exclusion of sharecroppers tenant farmers and migratory workers from the protection of minimumwage and social security laws no doubt the kennedy administration would like to do more for the poor than it has but it is hampered by the cabal of republicans and southern democrats in congress the revision of the fair labor standards act which raised the national minimum wage to the not exorbitant figure of an hour was a slight improvment over the previous act for instance it increased coverage of retailtrade workers from per cent to per cent but onefourth of the retail workers still excluded earn less than an hour there was also a considerable amount of shadowboxing involved of the workers newly covered only were making less than an hour and there was the exclusion of a particularly illpaid group of workers nobody had anything against the laundry workers personally it was just that they were weak unorganized and politically expendable to appease the conservatives in congress whose votes were needed to get the revision through they were therefore expended the result is that of the workers in the laundry drycleaning and dyeing industries just are now protected by the fair labor standards act perpetuating poverty it seems likely that mass poverty will continue in this country for a long time the more it is reduced the harder it is to keep on reducing it the poor having dwindled from twothirds of the population in to onequarter today no longer are a significant political force as is shown by the senates rejection of medicare and by the democrats dropping it as an issue in the elections last year also as poverty decreases those left behind tend more and more to be the ones who have for so long accepted poverty as their destiny that they need outside help to climb out of it this new minority mass poverty so much more isolated and hopeless than the old majority poverty shows signs of becoming chronic the permanence of low incomes is inferred from a variety of findings write the authors of the morgan survey in many poor families the head has never earned enough to cover the familys present needs for most families however the problem of chronic poverty is serious one such family is headed by a thirtytwoyearold man who is employed as a dishwasher though he works steadily and more than full time he earned over in his wife earned more but their combined incomes are not enough to support themselves and their three children although the head of the family is only thirtytwo he feels that he has no chance of advancement partly because he finished only seven grades of school the possibility of such families leaving the ranks of the poor is not high children born into poor families today have less chance of improving themselves than the children of the pre poor rags to riches is now more likely to be rags to rags indeed the morgan book concludes it appears that a number of the heads of poor families have moved into less skilled jobs than their fathers had over a third of the children of the poor according to the survey dont go beyond the eighth grade and will probably perpetuate the poverty of their parents there are a great many of these children in an important study of poverty made for a congressional committee in dr robert j lampman estimated that eleven million of the poor were under eighteen a considerable number of younger persons are starting life in a condition of inherited poverty he observed to which mr harrington adds the character of poverty has changed and it is no longer associated with immigrant groups with high aspirations it is now identified with those whose social existence makes it more and more difficult to break out into the larger society even when children from poor families show intellectual promise there is nothing in the values of their friends or families to encourage them to make use of it of the top per cent of highschool studentsthose scoring and over in iq testsonly half go on to college the explanation for this amazingand alarming situation is as much cultural as economic the children of the poor now tend to lack what the sociologists call motivation at least one foundation is working on the problem of why so many bright children from poor families dont ever try to go beyond high school mr raymond m hilliard at present director of the cook county ie chicago department of public aid and formerly commissioner of welfare for new york city recently directed a representativesample investigation which showed that more than half of the n ablebodied cook county residents who were on relief were functionally illiterate one reason cook county has to spend a month on relief is the lack of basic educational skills of relief recipients which are essen i tial to compete in our modern society an interesting footnote apropos of recent happenings at ole miss is that the illiteracy rate of the relief recipients who were educated in chicago is per cent while among those who were educated in mississippi and later moved to chicago it is percent

are negroes culture shy by fletcher e dalton am constantly appalled b y and concerned over the absence of negro patrons at events of general cultural importance in this country so seldom are there negroes attending events relating to the fine arts concerts lectures plays ballet that when i see a mere handful i feel especially blessed to what can this condition be attributed one excludes here the student and teacher of the arts although their representation is small whose interest after all is professional it is the general public with which i am concerned although negroes are frequently encountered at vocal performances along the eastern and western coasts opera and song recitals i have yet to see more than a score per season at orchestral concerts or instrumental recitals i would be willing to wager that not one of the major orchestras in the country can count on more than a dozen negro subscribers the situation worsens where the dramatic stage is concerned it was pathetic to view the small negro audience proportionately speaking which viewed purlie victorious ossie davis uneven but strikingly good comedy which enjoyed an enthusiastic press reaction and was produced on broadway a member of the cast of fly blackbird a play dealing with the race problem deplored the lack of negro attendance in a letter to the new york times patterns differ however in the south obviously discrimination or segregation has been the bar to attendance of things cultural negroes were summarily turned down at the box office except at federally or municipally owned places of entertainment but is this prevailingly the case today i submit that the anticipation of being turned down is enough to deter many wouldbe patrons but if the tickets were secured somehow would they be refused at the door perhaps so my first memory of a concert however is that of a rubenstein recital at womans college in greensboro north carolina at which my father and i were the only negroes present upon presenting our tickets ordered by mail we were shown to our seats with all due courtesy we enjoyed without anxiety or apprehension of any kind one of rubensteins best solo recitals i am sure this could be repeated in many southern cities but some positive effort has to be made on the part of the negroes themselves two years ago after the triumphant debut of leontyne price with the metropolitan opera association of new york when negro patrons were herded into the balcony of an atlanta theatre regardless of ticket location they lodged a protest which brought from general manager rudolf bing the declaration that the met would no longer play before segregated houses some time ago when the national road company of porgy and bess played in north carolina negroes it seems were refused tickets women then borrowed white children and went in great numbers as babysitters i am sure that the presence of negro actors and actresses on both the dramatic and the musical scene is rewarding in itself and that one should get out to see them perform as much as possible to go out only when they appear however is a strangely twisted form of dilettantism rightly one may rave over the performance of diahann carroll in no strings after all she has created the role hollow indeed however is the praise lavished on a price performance of aida an opera given perhaps as many as three times a week by various companies in new york city alone when it comes solely on the basis of vicarious experience through newspaper reviews wordofmouth reports or oneusually the firstvisit to the opera house the world of the fine arts like the world of sports is valid in and for itself it is only highlighted by special performers do we watch baseball games and boxing bouts only when we can directly identify with one of the participants a game by the new york yankees was no less exciting than a dodger game some years ago when the former had no negro players the addition of elston howard and others to the roster has added an extra dimension perhaps but the games are still worth watching even when howard is not in the lineup though we are absolutely glued to the tv when the globetrotters are playing we do not pass up a basketball game because the teams happen to have no negro players one could i suppose build up experience by attending only performances in which negroes appear comparing and contrasting various interpretations of the same role i should imagine that those people who last saw othello with paul robeson are growing rather weary with waiting for another negro to achieve such fabulous prominence in the role one would envy those persons who could afford to commute between paris and spoleto to compare grace bumbrys portrayal of carmen with that of shirley verrettcarter fees demanded by performers are high and there is little or no governmental support for the arts consequently box office prices are often extreme negroes are no longer only in professions at the bottom of the pay scale but even if they were they could afford live performances once in a while naturally one must be selective in the large cultural centers of the northeast and west in the small townships and in the south generally speaking one must take what comes along colleges and universities put on firstrate concert series and many municipal organizations put on free events of great variety if one must pay prices for nearly all cultural events usually begin at or under a fee which many movie houses get nowadays especially when the spectaculars are presented speaking of movies it is said that the nationwide lack of negro patrons at raisin in the sun helped it to be withdrawn much earlier than it would have been what argument can possibly justify this for those who prefer better locations tickets range upward through even to as for the last stated ostentation is everyones privilege for those who decry these prices standing room is frequently available often providing the best overall view in the theatre in short neither high admission prices nor lack of opportunity except in isolated instances can be called effective means of barring negroes from attending high calibre events if it is due to lack of previous exposure the remedy is pleasant and easily attained in a recent statement president kennedy noted that last year more people attended concerts than baseball games without forsaking the latter can we not be more highly represented at the former fepc is not enough by william l becker bout per cent of y the nonwhite citizens of the north and the west are now covered by fair employment practices laws but it is already apparent that laws prohibiting discrimination in employment will not in themselves provide equal employment opportunity for the negro mexicanamerican or puerto rican communities it is probable that no one really expected them to but in any case next steps are now in order the basic approach of fepcs has been that of merit employment the employer is enjoined to hire the best most qualified man regardless of his color or religion or national origin if an individual whatever his race is refused a job because someone better qualified is available the employer is not discriminating in the eyes of the law he is discriminating only if he denies the job to a negro or other minority person who is the best qualified for that job and then gives that job to a caucasian who is less well qualified the problem here is that fepcs prohibit discrimination only at the time when the actual decision to hire or to promote is being made the discrimination and segregation which have taken place for the many generations before that time of decision are not a factor in the law yet the minority person typically brings this historical disadvantage to the employment office on the other hand if an employer who recognizes this background problem wants to make a special point of employing more negro workers he may not place an order with an employment agency asking for negro applicants in many of our fep states he would be violating the law if a labor union wants to make a special effort to get more negroes placed in jobs in its jurisdictionpossibly in the face of some employer resistanceit too may be violating the law especially as it applies to the hiring clause of its contract this is especially ironic in those situations where for years the union has catered to employer requests for an italian speaking worker for this neighborhood or an oriental for atmosphere it is true that an employer may take care to advertise his job needs broadly and especially to get coverage in the minority communitys newspapers and radio stations he may then hope that more minority people will apply for the jobs this is not against the law but if minority people do not respondand this is often the casemust he end his efforts or be in violation of the law the lack of information in the minority communities is a very serious problem if a substantial number of negro workers is put to work in a previously allwhite industry the word eventually gets around but if there is no community experience with this employment opportunity and the employer is relying on the newspapers and the radio the message may not get through communications cannot be good with communities who have so long been alienated from the mainstream of american life lack of complaints the small number of complaints actually filed with the fep commissions is one result of this lack of information and communication the surveys reveal a much greater incidence of discriminatory practices than the number of filed complaints would indicate another weakness that has been revealed in the present fepc structure concerns the complaint procedure most fepc laws are built around the filing of a verified complaint while it is true that many job practices are improved because of the processingpossibly even the filingof one individual complaint it is also true that fep commissions have had to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction lack of evidence or lack of proof at least per cent of the cases filed the trailblazing efforts made by a number of fepc officials where despite a poor case they have found evidence of discrimination with which they were able to deal has been a valuable contribution to the methods of achieving progress but this only highlights their almost complete dependence on complaints and the severe limitations resulting from so few complaints actually being filed a commissions right to initiate action wherever it sees discrimination regardless of whether any complaint has been filed becomes critical under these circumstances a federal law based completely on response to complaints would be most effective in those areas where the minority population has had the most developed aspirations and sense of individual rights in these areas a federal law is needed least in the south on the other hand unless there is an organizational approach to the filing of complaints by the naacp or core or by the southern christian leadership movement few complaints will actually be filed drafters of fepc bills and proponents of fepc bills need to keep these problems in mind those who are attempting to administer present laws are well aware of them need for training but these technical deficiencies of fep laws are dwarfed by the problems of inadequate training in a period when the number of jobsespecially jobs requiring a minimum of skillseem to be declining in the long term curve unskilled and semiskilled males of all groups will be hard pressed to keep steady jobs the negro who is displaced by automation finds his problem compounded by the history of discrimination to which he and his race have for generations been subjected he is unequal to the guarantee of equal opportunity despite his years of hard and conscientious work because in comparison with the white jobhunter he starts with an inferior education and because of prefepc discrimination no experience in those jobs which might now be open to him there are many statistics on the current increase in technological unemployment but a few will suffice here in the last ten years the index of manufacturing has climbed from to but the number of production workers has remained at the level gerard piel publisher of the scientific american writes it is evident that the number is now due to decline the rate of unemployment for negro workers remains constantly about twice that of white workers in about per cent of the white workers in the country were unemployed as against about per cent of nonwhite workers in about per cent of the white workers were unemployed as against about per cent of nonwhite workers in other terms unemployment among nonwhite workers multiplies twice as fast as unemployment among white workers the impact of automation on negroes in skilled jobs is dramatically illustrated by a picture in business week of jan showing clerks being replaced by machines in the spiegel mail order house in chicago in one picture a large number of negro clerks are shown at work in order filling departments in the next picture a few mixed negro and white clerks are at work in a large room filled with machines it is to be noted that mr spiegel obviously has made a special effort to hire more than the usual proportion of negro employeesit is the machine not the white worker who is the competitor but it is minority youth in or just out of high school who are having the most difficulty finding employment youth in general make up a disproportionately large share of the unemployed in a study quoted by dr conant in slums suburbs we find that in june the unemployment rate nationwide is something over per cent for all age brackets but unemployment among youth under twentyone years of age is about per cent or more than twice the nationwide rate for all workers the department of labor has estimated that adolescents will enter the labor market in the sixties which of those will get what jobs exist on the basis of the pattern we see today negro youth will have much the rougher time landing a job dr conant reports in a slum area of people mostly negro a sampling of the youth population showed that roughly per cent of the boys and girls ages sixteen to twentyone were out of school and unemployed when one considers that the total population in this district is equal to that of a goodsized independent city the magnitude of the problem is appalling and the challenge to our society is clear need for counseling unless these negro boys and girls have been much better counseled by their families or their schools than is usually the case the kind of unskilled or service industry jobs they have been thinking of getting may not existfor them or for anyone else donald n michael in cybernation the silent conquest argues that service activities will also tend to displace workers by becoming selfservice by becoming cybernated and by being eliminated there may be other jobs or at least as a result of fepcs there may be other jobs from which they are not barred because of race but they may never have heard of these jobs perhaps they did hear of them but did not consider them early enough in life to prepare for them with the necessary high school courses and the basic high school diploma which becomes a prerequisite to enter the training program for such better jobs and if our negro youth did take what courses were available to him and did get his high school diploma the slum school is too often our least effective educational institution especially at the secondary level its problems are greater but its staff and its budget are usually less its students need more special counseling and motivation than the college preparatory student but they usually receive less than those who by home background and teacher inspiration are already motivated the inequality of their total preparation for the job market is enormous if this is true for the northern city slum school how much more is it true for the many segregated and lowstandard schools of the south the south alone does not pay for its neglect youngsters from these southern schools come north looking for work fepcs are too limited to be of much help to this mushrooming group of unprepared unemployed young people fepc in good faith gives them a key to the world of work but the door has a double lock and the other key is education the basic economic problems of america will keep a substantial number of americans out of work regardless of race or religion until programs are developed to meet the problems which automation brings as things stand now however americans who also belong to one of our racial minorities do make up and will make up a disproportionately large share of these unemployed approaches to equality it would now seem necessary to develop some more affirmative approaches to the problem of equal employment opportunity it would now seem necessary to move from a neutral emphasis on eliminating discrimination at the point of hiring to an emphasis on programs which will selfconsciously place more minority workers in more and better jobs the civil_rights slogan of merit employment cannot be allowed to become a selfimposed limitation on efforts to achieve equality in employment some of the approaches of the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity do seem geared to accomplish this purpose the requirement of annual progress reports from firms employing fifteen and a half million workers does not merely ask these employers to show compliance with the antidiscrimination clause in their government contract it also asks for a report on what positive progress has been made the plans for progress which are voluntary agreements with about thirty of the nations largest government contractors go even further the rca plan for example lists under plans for continuing affirmative action added emphasis to existing programs for the purpose of seeking out greater numbers of qualified negro and other minority group applicants through a concerted effort during hiring campaigns the objective is to increase such groups representation in occupations at the higher skill levels directives to employment and personnel managers at all locations to increase their contacts with negro organizations and other agencies in the development of qualified candidates for job referrals a general program of guidance and encouragement to be made available to negroes and other minority group employees to stimulate upgrading training and transfer potential within their occupational specialty training managers at each location to arrange periodic sessions with individual employees or with groups of interested employees a positive program of action to be undertaken for the appraisal and counseling of negro and other minority group employees who appear to have potential for advancement into supervisory and management positions the emphasis of the presidents committee is not on single cases of discrimination as it is with most fepc work but on the overall affirmative goal of employing more minority people the federal government can make other important contributions for example it is not enough to prohibit discrimination in the apprenticeship programs which receive government assistance it is important to take steps to provide for more apprenticeship training programs and more opportunities for the employment of apprentices equal opportunity is important but at the present time it is scarcity of apprenticeships which is being shared in california alone for example collective bargaining agreements are said to provide for about apprentices but employers are willing to employ only about this year of these over are in the carpenters program so the opportunities in all the remaining programs are very limited indeed it would help if the government would stipulate that every federal contract must have joint labormanagement apprenticeship training programs good vocational guidance programs are now administered by some state departments of employment these are especially helpful to young people this resource is not sufficiently used by minority people the federal government through its possible control over these state departments could make effective job counseling a service available in all states and to all people it could coordinate this counseling service with the training programs for national manpower needs for which the federal government must take increasing responsibility it is also necessary for government employment which is constantly expanding to develop a more conscious overall pattern of equal opportunity there is now substantial minority employment in government jobs but it varies from area to area from department to department and from job level to job level often depending on the prejudices of the local hiring officer here too it is necessary to go further back than the point of hiring for in some areas according to the united states civil_rights commission no negroes applied for the necessary civil service examinations perhaps while most of the schools in the south are still segregated the negro schools can play a special role making sure that their students are informed of possible civil service examinations and their requirementsand the fact that the federal government may not discriminate in employment at least not without violating a presidential order in short it is now urgent to recognize that the active measure of success for equal employment opportunity is not just the low number of discriminatory practices but the high number of minority people who are actually being hired the social remedy lies in a range of positive steps from improving the existing fep laws and practices to special training and recruiting programs to perhaps a drastic retooling of public school programs fep laws are an indispensable first step towards the achievement of equal job opportunity but even at best only a first step im sick of by horton floyd m sick soul i and tired of yes i am i say this knowing fuu weh that i will draw upon myself all the wrath and venom of a whole multitude of soulshouting chauvinists more intent on terror than on truth but it is about time that someone punctured the big balloon of budding black supremacy and it might just as well be me first let it be clearly understood that ilike most fairminded clearthinking americans negro and whitefully understand the emotions which drive so many negroes to seize what they consider a racial virtue and to attempt to raise it to the level of a unique and exclusive badge of superiority the racist practices which degrade and dehumanize negroes in this country deserve the worst possible opprobium it is madness but must negroes ape this madness if madness is to be fought with madness then what is to happen to sanity one of the legacies left by our negro ancestors was an enduring sense of simplicity and saneness must we abandon our heritage in the act of defending it in a brilliant article in a recent issue of the progressive magazine columnist murray kempton wrote we all americans owe to unknown southern negroes whatever has been epic in the history of the united states for the past ten years cooks and maids poor isole farmers students in colleges that hardly have libraries have become authors of that history kempton is a white man one who understands how racism can drive people to depths of depravity on the one hand and to great heights of nobility on the other hand and he knows which hand will hold the victory they will win who cling to honesty and truth and a vision unclouded by hate and revengehowever meritedand to the promise always inherent in the idea of freedom and dignity but the fanatical adherents of the cult of soul do not seem to understand this they are playing the enemys game by isolating what they believe to be a superior negro characteristic they are merely giving credence to the racists dogma they have swallowed the propaganda of racial superiority and are trying to twist it around to serve their own undernourished egos to begin with just what is this thing called soul stripped of emotion it seems to stand as that quality of negroness resulting from the fact of racial oppression and denial physiognomy aside negroes differ from whites in america in proportion to the degree of variance of their life experiences the american culture is a manyfaceted thing andcontrary to the preachings of the silly southernersthe pattern of life devised by negroes in an effort to overcome the obstacles strewn in their path is one of the central elements of the complex whole this negro subculture as the sociologists call it infused as it is with hurt and anger and anguish and love is the fertile womb of the concept called soul as expressed in muthe calm indomitable elegance of marian anderson the cool hard determination of james h meredith these are the qualities bred by suffering and denial and the strong unbreakable faith in human dignitywhich is a strong unbreakable faith in self but the negro is merely expressing in his own very special way the same qualities of character and perseverance which other races and sicwhich seems to be the principal medium through which it is expoundedsoul is the sorrow and pain and joythe tonal sum total of the negro experience it is the salty blues of dinah washington the wailing laments of ray charles and the sweet bitter soaringly melancholy notes from the horn of miles davis and it is more it also is the lilting searching imageshattering prose of james baldwin the loping insinuating panthery grace of sidney poitier other peoples express in their different ways the soul cultists would have the world believe that those characteristics bred by the negro experience are ipso facto superior this is pure nonsense the negro does indeed stand at this moment in historyin a morally privileged position but this is a gift chiefly given him by the folly and failure of white people in the pursuit of their vaunted principles by practicing rampant racism in the face of all the noble declarations about freedom and democracy white people have surrendered their right to identification with these precepts negroes can yet lay claim to these principles for circumstances have not provided negroes the opportunity of betraying them not yet that is but the black chauvinists are certainly doing their part to throw away whatever moral advantage the same logic apply in other areas to other art formsto opera for instance since opera is the creation of white people developed out of their experiences it therefore follows that no negro can sing it with appropriate feeling leontyne price then can never hope to equal the performance of renata tebaldi in interpreting the music of the italian composer verdi on the operatic stage and grace bumbry negroes may have in this ugly racial rivalry take the question of jazz for example in recent months a great wave of militancy has swept over certain negro jazz musicians and jazz lovers jazz they declare fire in eyes is a negro creation born of the travail and heartache and primeval memory of the race and therefore no white man can feel it and play it with the proper amount of soul well okay for the sake of argument assume this is so would who had the singular honor of singing the german wagners music at the great bayreuth festival should have accepted beforehand that she could never match elizabeth schwarzkopf as venus absurd worse plain silly leontyne price and grace bumbryand a whole handful of superlative negro singersare extraordinary vocal artists capable of performing operatic roles on a par with their white peers the fact of race is just inconsequential and white vocalists like barbara dane and anita oday can sing rings around a whole host of runofthemill negro blues singers and will match some of the best can diahann carroll sing the blues better than peggy lee because diahann is a negro and peggy is white well the answer to that is obvious diahann is a singer of sweet and sophisticated songs and she brings such an exquisite quality to them that the great richard rodgers who is white wrote a musical for her on the other hand peggy latches onto a barrelhouse number as if she came from rough and ready lower basin street rather than the placid plains of jamestown north dakota when it is a matter of style with these two lovely ladies race is irrelevant i want to make it perfectly clear yea to even emphasizethat i am not saying that negroes do not bring a certain indigenous quality to the blues that they do is selfevident but by the same token it is not true that only negroes can sing the blues any more than it is true that only whites can sing romantic balladsor opera american negroes have much to be proud of no group of people in this countryand few in any countryhave had to struggle as long and as hard against such strong and unrelenting forces in order to enjoy a measure of freedom the battle has been fought with great valor and with even greater dignity and the american culture has been glorified and enriched by the negros uncommon faith and perseverance but as splendid as the negros fight has been it has not been really unique considered in the vast context and panorama of history courage and determination are traits that belong to the human race not merely to the negro race nothing could be more selfdefeating than the idea that negroes share some superior natural virtue alien to the rest of mankind this is rabid racism no matter what other name it assumes and that is why i am sick and tired of hearing all this boastful talk about soul soul is merely an esotericsounding concept disguising the ugliness of racisminreverse and i want no part of it neither now nor ever commenting upon the contents of this volume the authors wrote in the picture of life in that emerges from these chapters is a candidcamera shot of the community in the final stages of the depression and in the midst of the second world war depression and war have passed peace and prosperity prevail the reader will no doubt want to know to what extent has the community changed during the past years bronzeville as a compact and selfconscious community still exists there has been very little change in the fundamental values of its people or in the basic social structure and cultural patterns of the community if we compare the content of the chicago defender as described in black metropolis for instance with that in the worlds greatest weekly of today we find that the basic themes and orientations persist although details have changed church and club news is still reported in elaborate detail and race heroes and race leaders are still big news although joe louis has been replaced by rafer johnson and archie moore and haile selassie by the new african leaders stories about martin_luther_king now compete for space with those about oldline politicians and race leaders and there is an increasing number of firsts and a diminishing number of onlies even a cursory tour of bronzeville will reveal that the measure of the man remains the same and that much of life still revolves around those axes of life originally selected for discussion staying alive getting ahead having fun praising god and advancing the race the changes which have occurred are related primarily to two crucial facts of the s namely that america is experiencing a period of prosperity and that negroes are living in the era of integration by the lean years had gone just staying alive had ceased to be the problem for most people negroes were beginning to sing happy days are here again instead of moaning ive been down so long down dont bother me by money had been circulating freely and rapidly for over a decade credit had been made easy through budget plans and wage assignments and in it was even possible to find an ad like this in the negro press everyone rides we guarantee you a car even if youve had a repossession garnishee or judgment no comakers needed fine clothes new furniture and household gadgets ubiquitous tv and radio sets as well as a plethora of cars give visible evidence of bronzevilles participation in the abundance of the affluent society the negro population of chicago doubled between and bronzevilles doctors dentists lawyers preachers and businessmen captured a sizeable share of the dollars circulating in the expanded and to some extent captive black belt market their offices churches and homes reflect the new prosperity as do newspaper notices of frequent continental and occasional intercontinental travels and the elaboration of social rituals the addition of new neighborhoods to the black belt has increased the number of negro aldermen in city hall and has resulted in more precinct captains ward officials and jobs for the boys as well as symbolic appointments to high office the business center of bronzeville has shifted two miles southward as the community has grown in sizefrom th street to rd street negro entrepreneurs have opened up numerous new restaurants taverns liquor stores hotels barber shops and beauty parlors some negroes have also made a killing in real estate negro cab owners have not only expanded their illegal but protected business of running jitney cabs on bronzevilles main thoroughfares but they have also won the fight to operate their metered cabs throughout the city negro insurance companies have held their own and some have prospered greatly although they are still pygmies beside giants like metropolitan and prudential morticians too have profited from the population increase a highly successful sausage company and a cosmetics enterprise are both selling to the broader white market but these are the exceptions which prove the rule that negro business still caters to a predominantly negro market the most spectacular business successes during the past decade have been scored in the publishing field one enterprising bronzeville publisher has nurtured his magazines ebony jet tan and negro digest to the point where they not only attract a high volume of national advertising but are also sold on newsstands throughout the country and overseas a daily defender has been in existence for almost five years to supplement the weekly chicago defender both publishers have purchased property in neardowntown chicago and moved their businesses there a bronzeville businessman has bought the pittsburgh courier and now publishes a chicago courier as well for the benefit of readers in black metropolis the new crusader has replaced dynamite as a sensational race conscious agitational organ carrying the slogan negroes must control their own community the preachers have taken full advantage of the fat years to pay off mortgages and to build new churches and remodel old ones attractive modernistic edifices have sprung up and several church community centers planned and dreamed of during the depression years have now materialized also as in the past negro congregations have been buying the churches and synagogues abandoned by white congregations as they retreat in the face of negro settlement in new neighborhoods what was once bronzevilles most spectacular negro business policyhas been taken over by the mob policy shops no longer operate openly as negro businesses the jones brothers the gentlemen racketeeers who were described as race heroes in the first edition of black metropolis have now gone into legitimate business in mexico city they fled chicago after one of them was kidnapped by white racketeers and held for ransom the front man whom they left to look after their business in chicago was eventually gunned down on a street in bronzeville thus making the takeover of the once black syndicate complete while some successful negro policy operators still remain they are really only small fry and none of them exhibit social pretensions the policy racket lost its functional utility when prosperity came to bronzeville and its glamor when it ceased to be a negro controlled business few race leaders feel called upon to defend it now as they did during the depression change is most immediately evident in the physical setting within which community activities take place the black belt has grown enormously in size and thousands of negroes are now living in fine apartment buildings and in relatively new attractive homes vacated during the last ten years by white people who were getting ahead and who symbolized the fact by increasing the physical distance between themselves and negroes with money in the bank and gi and fha loans available bronzevilles home owners have been lavishing attention upon their newly acquired properties partly because of intrinsic satisfaction in so doing pride of possession and aso because it is part of the ritual of advancing the race they feel impelled to stamp out the stereotype that negroes always run neighborhoods down even the older parts of the black belt have a new look extensive slumclearance and rebuilding have changed the face of the black belts northern section while elbow grease paint and grass storm windows and flowers have eliminated much of the drab rundown depression look of yesteryears but unkempt neighborhoods and litterladen alleys and streets have by no means disappeared and bronzevilles masses are still piled up on top of each other in cramped quarters to a greater extent than in any other part of midwest metropolis to them the black ghetto has become a gilded ghetto but a ghetto all the same the economic and ecological changes have inevitably affected what was referred to as the system of social classes in bronzeville although the basic pattern ville although the basic pattern has not been altered the departure of the gentlemen racketeers from the city and the tendency of members of what was described as the upper shady group to concentrate their investments in legitimate enterprises has been accompanied by the disappearance of an upperclass sector that was important during the depression years it might now be more accurate to define a center of orientation at the upperclass level called the unconventional uppers or the sporting set and to drop the term upper shadies the style of life of the upper respectables or the conventional uppers has not changed it has simply become more elaborate the same exclusive male clubs originally described in black metropolis set the tone of upperclass social life but the civic activity and social ritual of the upperclass and the activities of the greek letter fraternities and sororities are now functioning to weld together a new and larger upperclass stratum based upon a core of younger college graduates recruited from all social levelsthose who have made money during the period of prosperity and who want to live the upperclass style of fife not all of the successful professional men strive to become upperclass however some settle for a less expansive uppermiddleclass existence the upper and uppermiddle strata continue to supply leadership for the national association for the advancement of colored people the urban league the ymca the ywca provident hospital and a wide range of other civic organizations in bronzeville members of these strata too are beginning to appear in greater numbers upon the citywide boards of charitable and civic organizations thus linking bronzeville to influential sectors of the white community through membership in a variety of interracial organizations upon whose boards they serve at whose meetings they frequently speak and with whose members they now sustain to an increasing extent more intimate social participation but the major professional organizations do not yet welcome their negro counterparts as members and parallel structures to those organizations still exist in bronzeville the members of the upper stratum also continue to link bronzevilles elite to the negro elite in cities throughout the country by membership in national negro organizations and clubs and by frequent intervisiting the black proletariat divided into middleclass and lowerclass segments and sharing the fruits of the period of prosperity is even less inclined than in the past to think of itself as a part of some interracial workingclass in the marxian senseexcept during an occasional strike many of its members who however like their white counterparts belong to unions by checkoff if not by choice middleclass status now as in the past demands respectable public behavior relatively conventional family life and some concern for getting ahead the fact that recent migrants from the south are better educated than those of the past has probably augmented the size of bronzevilles middle class the world of the lower class is no longer neatly patterned in a physical sense as it was sixteen years ago slum clearance and urban redevelopment programs have wiped out the concentrated cluster of lowerclass institutions and scattered the population but as a subculture the world of the lower class still exists storefront churches flourish but illiterate and semiliterate individuals who feel that they are called to preach find it increasingly difficult to rent stores since rundown business streets are being eliminated by slum clearance and lowcost housing projects make no provision for such spiritual entrepreneurs there has been a substantial increase however in the number of conventional churches catering to lowerclass religious tastes the two large churches which were popular in these religious circles when black metropolis first appeared are still in existence but elder lucy is dead and when she passed her body was paraded through bronzevilles streets in state with coach and horses new churches appealing to recent immigrants from the south are now far more popular than either of these two churches still constitute a center of stability amid the constant flux and disorder of the world of the lower class bronzevilles upper class continues to worry about the negro image created among outsiders by lower class activities but they have had to resign themselves to what they consider the loud and unrepresentative radio programs for which the lower status churches easily find sponsors they are particularly concerned over the high degree of social disorganization which persists at the lowerclass level for the slicks the mr bens the baby chiles and their circle of associates are still prevalent how prevalent we really do not know but because their plight is so dramatic and their activities so unconventional they receive continuous publicity and thus help to fix an image in the popular mind within the disorganized segment of the lower class are the highly publicized unwed and deserted mothers some of whom draw a regular income from welfare sources as well as the women and men who have formed loose and shifting commonlaw alliances the recalcitrant and sometimes violent school children the teenage gangsters the dope users and pushers and the small hard core of habitual criminals urban renewal tends to make the entire city more aware of bronzevilles lumpenproletariat for as the slums are cleared and the physical locus of the lower class is shattered individuals and families are forced to scatter into middleclass neighborhoods and onto the margins of these areas since public relocation housing has never kept pace with demolition enterprising realtors in middleclass neighborhoods are always ready to convert houses and apartment buildings in order to accommodate new tenants in crowded discomfort while the most marginal families huddle in dilapidated buildings awaiting demolition within clearance areas an occasional tragedy as when a firetrap burns or a baby is bitten by a rat excites a spate of excited newspaper comment and sometimes an expose the urban league refers to members of this group as chicagos dps bigger thomases as richard wright described them in native son keep on being bred and the frying pan is still useful against the rodents most of the people in midwest metropolis are now aware that all negroes are not that way but many people negro and white feel that too many of them are the middle classes insist upon increased police protection but realize that arrest and punishment solve no problems there is a general feeling that all social work efforts are merely holding operations until complete job equality and adequate housing provide a new physical and economic framework of existence and new incentives for young people out of which it is hoped new patterns of behavior will grow the lowerclass churches do not speak of the condition of the disorganized masses and very few brands are snatched from the burning despite continuous praying and singing preaching and revivals in recent years new black gods of the metropolis have appeared the leader and teacher the honorable elijah muhammad who was taught by the god whose proper name is allah has bought a synagogue near the university of chicago and converted it into mr muhammads temple no with its affiliated university of islam here and through his newspaper and over the radio he exhorts the socalled negroes to repudiate the white mans religion to cast off the names inherited from slavery to eschew pork drinking smoking and gambling and to help build a nation in this wilderness of north america he encourages his followers to go into business but the attempts of the muslims to erect a business center in a new negro middleclass neighborhood created such vigorous opposition that the venture was blocked the moors were operating in chicago as early as the s but it is only since the second world war that black muslims have attracted a substantial following the female faithful in their colorful pseudoarabic gowns and the fanatical males including the judotrained fruit of islam can fill the chicago stadium at nationwide conventions of the black muslims but the number of people in bronzeville who have actually joined the movement would hardly fill the auditoriums of the two largest baptist churches the rise of the black muslims is one index to the deep resentment among lowerclass negroes but is no more likely to have a significant impact upon bronzeville than did the communist party during the depression years neither the christian churches nor mr muhammad are able to influence that large segment of the lowerclass whose resentment is expressed in apathy cynicism and aggression and whose primary mode of escape is through having a good time it is the hope of most middleclass social workers and educators that as increasing numbers of migrants find regular employment as they settle inand as the educational level of bronzevilles population rises more and more people will adopt the middleclass way of life in addition to conventional family patterns this would involve widespread acceptance of church oriented and society oriented behavior the middleclass way of life thus takes on a degree of significance which justifies detailed consideration by sociologists it represents a realistic goal toward which younger people in the lowerclass can aspire it provides patterns which can be acquired without a great deal of selfdenial and with only a moderate amount of schooling a regular income is the main prerequisite it is a pattern which is attractive to the masses and which can motivate people to strive for it judged by intellectual standards it represents devotion to trivia judged by functional standards it provides stability amidst disorder consensus instead of anomie middleclass society is very much as it was sixteen years ago the same clubs which set the pattern when black metropolis was originally written are still going strong the kool kustomers dances are even more elaborate in this era of integration and they are sometimes held in loop hotels but scores of new clubs have also come into being some of them perhaps more popular than the amethyst girls and the kool kustomers the emergence of new clubs is sometimes mentioned in defender club notes in such announcements as a capacity crowd frolicked with the dapper dans when the clubs marked its first anniversary in clubdoms ranks or when it was stated that the contessas were busily preparing for their debut in a first annual dance fashion shows have become one of the most popular moneyraising activities throughout bronzeville prosperity has made possible an extreme elaboration of the cult of clothes which serves to integrate the world of society and the world of the church in upperclass and middleclass circles style shows and fashion revues are a fixture of the bronzeville subculture and no one sees anything incongruous about the guild of a catholic church sponsoring a pert and pretty fashion show or a baptist church presenting excelsiors in fashion review at its thirtythird anniversary services at the center of the cult of clothes is a group of amateur and professional models male and female some of whom are graduates of or students at charm and model schools the pace is still set by the group of women referred to in black metropolis as being the fashion setters sixteen years ago along with their younger admirers these women have connections with downtown department stores and some of them occasionally travel to paris in order to familiarize themselves with the latest styles these models move about bronzeville continually appearing at events sponsored by clubs and churches or giving their own revues despite the conspicuous consumption characteristic of bronzevilles people during the past decade considerable anxiety and apprehension exist beneath the surface for the bubble could burst as it once did in also despite gains in living space the middle classes still have the problems posed by lorraine hansberry in her play a raisin in the sun uneasiness exists also over certain dilemmas presented by the era of integration all race leaders must express full commitment to the ultimate goal of complete and total integration but they find themselves involved in contradictions which result in inconsistencies of attitude and behavior there are problems and questions such as the following bronzevilles political power is based upon the existence of a segregated community what kind of political influence and rewards could negroes hope to expect if the black belt were to disappear some middleclass negroes are living in integrated communities the pressure of an overcrowded black belt is likely to transform such communities into sections of the black ghetto should negroes cooperate with whites in using various devices to maintain a realistic racial balance in these neighborhoods given the fact that their fellow black citizens need more housing should they help to keep the proportion of negro residents down in such areas the prosperity of negro business and professional men rests upon the existence of a black belt could they survive under conditions of general competition if the church is desegregated will mixed congregations ever accept negro ministers are there values and cultural products which have developed among negroes that will be lost if full integration ever becomes a reality such questions do not of course have the same urgency for those whose incomes do not depend upon the existence of a negro market or a negro electorate the negro masses for instance applaud the new race heroes on the white sox and cubs teams without giving a thought to the effect of this draining away of talent from the negro baseball leagues younger people too seem to be gaining a greater sense of confidence in their ability to face competition in an integrated america bronzevilles institutions keep alive the myth of salvation via negro business but the fact remains that despite the multiplication of small capitalists and the greater affluence of some large ones negroes have not broken into the industrial and commercial big time and the bulk of the negro markers money goes to white banks and loan companies the supermarkets the downtown department stores and to white insurance companiesnot to negro enterprises occasionally integrationist trends are viewed with alarm as a threat to negro business in midapril of for instance the chicago negro chamber of commerce met to discuss how does integration affect negro business and the new crusader reported expressions of grave concern the negro masses on the whole have shown no inclination to sacrifice in order to build cooperatives nor to earmark a part of their income for supporting negro private ventures enough have shown racial loyalty however to support two very successful savings and loan companies and one cooperative store and credit union the goal of a selfcontained negro economy has always been considered a defensive measure and not an ideal solution to bronzevilles problems now some of bronzevilles capable and alert oldergeneration businessmen are talking of selling to the american market not just to the negro market and at least one is proving that it can be donehe has developed a cosmetics business which sells one line of goods to negroes and another to whites operating on a national scale his annual conventions of executives and salesmen are held at downtown chicago hotels and the defender refers not only to the lush setting but also to the fact that these conferences are an example of integration in action the competitive situation in this period of highly developed capitalism makes it very difficult for negroes to enter business with sufficient capital and enough influential contacts to ensure a successful building up of impressive manufacturing or commercial concerns most negro businessmen find it much safer to invest in real estate or businesses within the negro community than to risk their capital in businesses oriented toward the general american market in recent years too there has been increased interest within the negro middle class in conventional stocks and bonds investments grumbling about jim crow is still one of bronzevilles major indoor sports taking the white man apart remains a routine conversational activity but fulltime fighting against discrimination and segregation is considered a specialist activitythe job for race leaders and race heroes for a certain kind of white person for job holders in the newer race relations organizations and for college kids who go freedom riding in the south or take a part in sitins and swimins in midwest metropolis everybody feels however that such people should be backed up raising money for freedom riders became a part of church ritual during the height of the movement just as campaigns for the scottsboro boys emmett tills defense fund or the montgomery bus boycotters had been in the past people also generally feel that they should contribute to the naacp and urban league even when they may not do so but for most people wearing their dark skin color is like living with a chronic disease one learns to take it and not to let it unduly cramp ones style of life and anodynes are always present religion the social ritual whiskey dopeand for those who can afford it an occasional trip to europe latin america or africa as a kind of play therapy from the black muslims point of view negroes should deliberately accept segregation they assert that negroes of all social classes are losing their selfrespect by pursuing an integrationist willothewisp the muslims continuously assail martin_luther_king the freedom riders the naacp and the urban league and call for the building of a black nation upon land to be secured from the government as compensation for back wages stolen during several centuries of slavery one member writes there are at least three things that we must do in order to lift the heel of satan ie the white man from our necks and that is to one separate our people from the caucasian race which means putting an end to integration second return the white mans religion of christianity which is the mental chain that is rusting and destroying our peoples minds and third we must come together this means dissolving our very foolish and false class system doctors professors lawyers college students mothers and fathers the young and old should take up the banner of islam and build a righteous nation on this earth most negroes reject the muslims racism and separatism while admiring their militancy and successful business enterprises during the s there has been a marked increase of interest in africa among the people of black metropolisa fascination with the rise of the new african states coupled with some resentment over the fact that special treatment is reserved for african diplomats so that they are less subject to discrimination at the upper and uppermiddleclass levels this interest is reflected in occasional parties for prominent african visitors in vacation trips to africa by the few who can afford it by investment in a few african business projects and by the frequent programming of lectures and discussions about africa before church groups and clubs at lower status levels there is considerable vicarious identification with leaders like jomo kenyatta and lumumba who symbolize violent assault upon the ramparts of white supremacy yet bronzeville rejects neogarveyism with its backtoafrica emphasis as decisively as it rejects mr muhammads nation in this wilderness identification with emergent africa while providing reinforcement for the sentiment of race pride is not diverting bronzevilles leadership from the primary goal of full integration into american life this blending of interest in the new africa with the american struggle for equality was reflected in the activities of those race leaders who in were preparing for an exposition to celebrate the centennial of the emancipation proclamation their lobbying had secured financial support from both the federal and state governments most of the exhibits were to deal with the progress of the negro in america since slavery but considerable time and money was also being expended upon preparing an attractive display of our african background and of development in modern africa life in bronzeville is interesting often exciting and always meaningfulthough usually not in terms of values richard wright would have respected or admired yet like most intellectuals he underemphasized the extent to which a serious interest in art literature music and ideas has always existed side by side with the social ritual in the upper and uppermiddle classes the system is paying off and occasionally someone hits the jackpot opportunities and money are present for having a ball when people want to the mass culture provides a very wide range of satisfactions negrosparked race riots or mass demonstrations emigration to mother africa to the soviet motherland or to mr muhammads utopia have no appeal for they do not make sense in a period of prosperity and the era of integration and the big questions such as what of the bomb are seldom asked in bronzeville negroes in bronzeville are very much americans and this means too that if the masses are driven too far they are likely to fight back despite their sometimes seemingly indifferent reactions to discrimination and segregation a potential for future violence within black metropolis exists that should not and cannot be ignored the quiet leader by bernard molohon he year marks t the anniversary of the p passing of one of the truy nee ro lead ers of this century but because he shunned publicity during a lifetime devoted to bettering the lot of his people washington wire services gave his death only passing notice by the time those dispatches were published in the hinterlands most newspapers had cut the story to one paragraph the humble man who died of a heart attack at the age of would have been very well satisfied with that because he was a government worker and those people are said to have a passion for anonymity he might have expected even less but i am one person who feels he deserved a large page one story dr ambrose caliver was the first negro ever to receive a permanent professional appointment to the united states civil service breaking this longtime insurmountable barrier alone could have tagged dr caliver for immortality among his people for his persistence not only opened those doors but helped pave the way for higher appointments of the ralph bunches and the robert weavers the latter to a full cabinet post if president kennedy had not been frustrated by a few narrow politicians however dr caliver was not satisfied merely to have broken down a colored berlin wall for years he quietly headed the negro education unit in the u s office of education working diligently to better the lot of his people in the one field which could truly make them equaland free and when he died he was chief of the adult education section of the u s office of education where he could help older people of all races who felt they had missed something in their youth or who eagerly wanted to go on learning among them he felt there was a high percentage of negroes because dr caliver wished that his many accomplishments be softpedaled he died barely known outside of american educational circles sad to relate millions of american negroes were hardly aware of his existence but his influence touched and will continue to affect the life of every negro in the united states for a long time and influence for generations many even beyond these shores i first met dr caliver shortly after world war ii had broken out in europe he was then head of the negro education unit in the u s office of education and i was starting to gather material for my book voices of democracy since the iron boot of dictatorship was daily grinding down more areas of democracy america was determined to do everything possible to see that the torch of freedom was not entirely blotted out my little job was to put together a handbook for teachers speakers and writers showing what had been said and done over the centuries to further the cause of democracy one section was to consist of memorable stories of the long fight for freedom the other of quotations on all phases of freedom what was happening to minorities in europe probably blinded my thinking when i called on dr caliver for quotes and stories on the rights of minorities especially something from negro leaders since he was best acquainted with them the tall welldressed man thought a minute and then politely asked what other subheads i would have in my book i looked at my rough notes and read off some of the things i had in mind our inalienable rights liberty defending liberty giving up liberty power suffrage criticism freedom to know freedom of expression freedom of conscience free government free homes justice equality what we read and write truth thinking as we please they were all just in the thinking stage but i felt most quotations would fall under those headings dr caliver made some notes and then told me he would have something for me in a few days he did but he personally brought it to my office rather than have his secretary call me and tell me the material was ready ive probably gone pretty far afield here and there he said rather apologetically but you can use what you want and throw out the rest for instance booker t washington spent his life trying to improve the mind of the negro but to my way of thinking one of his most memorable remarks was that no man should be ashamed to use his hands he stood in front of my desk as i glanced over the sheets he had handed me besides the pointed remark by booker t washington that the black man who cannot let love and sympathy go out to the white man is only half free and vice versa he included statements by such negro leaders as charles s johnson james weldon johnson william pickins and charles harris wesleyall caliver contemporaries but there was nothing by dr ambrose caliver when i reminded him of this he modestly said he had nothing worthy of being included after dr caliver left i realized that he had not confined himself to quotations by negro leaders on the narrow subject of minorities i remembered that i had suggested just that but without making a point of it dr caliver had included statements by negro leaders which would fit many other categories i could as he reminded me use them or not as i saw fit i wondered why i had been so warped my only excuse was that the pathetic state of minorities in europe screamed at me every day from the front pages of our newspapers certainly negroes had said things about other phases of freedom and liberty dr caliver also gave me leads to such stories as how john quincy adams broke the gag rule in the house of representatives with petitions signed by slaves and how james madison living in a slave state showed how he detested slaverywelcome additions to a section of the book carrying capsule stories of democracy another thing bothered me after dr caliver left my office he had stood courteously at my desk while i overcome by the windfall of material he had brought me had been too absorbed or too impolite to ask him to sit down i mentioned this at lunch to a fellowworker in the office of education who had known dr caliver for a long time i know i should have invited him to sit down but wouldnt you think he would have anyway i asked no not dr caliver said my friend not until he gets to know you better for all he knows now you might be one of those birds who thinks hes superior to a negro so you were making him stand there on purpose what i was too surprised to say more sure and he wouldnt fight about it if you were one of those guys after all as long as he knows youre not any better than he is nothing else matters but a big guy like that by big i meant that dr caliver with his string of college degrees really was a big man in educational circles in later months we had a good laugh together when i told him he was several degrees smarter than was since i had missed getting my ba by three days but my friend thought i was referring to the fact that dr caliver was physically larger than i was well while he was standing there he was looking down on you wasnt he later when i got to know dr caliver better and found how easy it was to talk over such problems objectively i had it driven home again that trifles never bother a real big man no matter what his race the overall job of bettering the educational plight of the american negro was such a big undertaking that dr caliver could not waste time jousting with puny windmills human or material and today when a dr ralph bunche says i both scorn and pity white bigots but i despise those who are black i can see that the influence of dr caliver has seeped down to the next generation just as dr caliver learned from his great hero booker t washington that love and sympathy are twoway streets knowing dr caliver better also gave me a new insight into his thinking and explained many of his actions i found that he in reaching his high state in civil service met with many problems similar to those encountered by benjamin o davis sr in becoming the first negro in u s history to receive a generals star but neither man seemed to resent the fact that to get such an appointment he probably had to be just a little better than the white man who attained the same grade instead both men appeared to welcome the gauntlet thrown down for them and were proud to pick it up in the end of course both confounded critics of the appointments however at times in dr calivers career he felt as if he had run into a brick wall but instead of resenting it or getting violent about it he merely marked it down as experience refused to make the same mistake again backed up and made what he called an endrun around the wall he was quite adamant about violence im sure he was not a a pacifist but his attitude was that every time an agitator stirred negroes to violence they lost ground that had been gained by peaceful means and at the same time lost many potential friends he preferred to knock down enemies in a far more lasting and devastating manner somewhat in the way the man who was to become the catholic churchs first negro cardinal did a free north new jersey barber who refused to let him in his chair with a shrug and the remark its all right prayed for the man as dr caliver regarded such incidents the barber could quickly repair a broken window or even heal a split lip but he could never wipe out the scar left by such a perfect squelch and speaking of resentment i once asked dr caliver if it wasnt an affront to his race that a big part of the u s office of education was set aside as a negro unit when education in this country should be free and equal no i dont resent the idea at all negroes have special problems at least at this stage of the game and those problems can best be handled by people of their own race time will gravitate this unit out of existence of course but if the whites had learned that lesson early in their handling of the american indian maybe they wouldnt have had so much violence in finally settling the indian problem that made sense to me a pacific northwest native who had been reared a mile from an indian reservation dont you get discouraged with the slowness of negro educational progress in this country i asked him not at all we havent done so badly in the few generations since the american negro was freed from slavery would you like to see some charts on how weve progressed from practically one hundred percent illiteracy in just a few short years i mean when compared to what the white man did in hundreds of years after he came to americaa free man i got the point however dr caliver went on there is just one thing a good many negroes havent learned yet from those white men even the ones who couldnt write their names many of those people came from countries where their station in life had been set for generations they came to america to get out of those ruts especially as they moved west one of the first things those illiterate pioneers did was build schools for their youngsters they were not too illiterate to realize that there would be jobs opening up in america for which their children couldnt qualify unless they were educated and they put forth a good deal of money and effort to solve their own educational problems i do not go along with any negro who spurns education because he thinks it is fruitless to prepare for a better job in america that was about as violent a remark as i ever heard from the lips of the man who in his humble way was trying to lead his race to a better life i am sure dr ambrose caliver would have been a success in any line of endeavor he chose with his unaffected dignity i often thought what a great doctor of medicine he could have become and how much money he could have made in that profession but he chose to get his doctorate in another field and to devote his life to helping all his people improve their lotat great personal and financial sacrifice to himself that is the mark of a true humanitarian and america lost one it could ill afford to lose when dr ambrose caliver died the negros escape from freedom by dr nathan hare recent years of study and observation of fellow negroes from coast to coast in america have made me ever aware of a strange paradox this is the unfortunate fact that the negro in our time is tenaciously engaged in a frantic escape from freedom the manner in which he makes his escape is somewhat curious and subtleif not sneakyyet unapparent to most owing in part to the complex sources from which it sprang indeed it has been a shocking study to me to analyze the motives for this pathetic situation i first became aware of it some years ago as i listened to the overworked cliche responses made to the question of negro disunity apathy and the appalling sense of defeatism that is the plague of so many of them i noted that they invariably fell back on some convenient rationalization minimizing their own responsibility and group worth such as well you know we originated along the nile across from the euphrates before the dawn of civilization and the white europeans came and you know we were slaves for several centuries and you just cant expect etc it was not long before i came to realize that in spite of the fact that the negros past experiences and enduring white abuse have inflicted formidable burdens on him negro intellectuals in their noble efforts to explain away and apologize for his current failures actually have contributed to the negros sense of defeatism and helplessness the resulting tendency is to refrain from what is thought to be futile action on his part as an individual this not only affects the negros conduct in the area of whitenegro relations in a number of amusing and interesting waysmore about that laterbut has tended as well to make him curiously more conservative in some respects than whites increasingly he has grown unwilling to differ from the general herdparticularly the white one thus he voluntarily enslaves himself without question or opposition to the white norms and standards which eric fromm the world famous psychoanalyst has diagnosed as representing collective neuroses let us take up these matters one by one to indicate specific ways in which the negro manages to escape from freedom while at the same time crying out that it is only being denied him it is apparent to begin with that the custom of apologizing for the negro has four main effects increasingly allows the negro to give up his fate to the whims of the white world magnifies the sense of white power and superiority minimizes the negros own sense of responsibility for doing something about his situation himself including the forcing of white hands and all of the foregoing contribute to the destruction of the negros selfrespect in both the individual and the collective sense undermine his selfsufficiency and destroy his general feeling of togetherness indeed a princeton university psychologist bertram p karon recently made an intensive study of the negro personality in which he concluded that some negroes now inwardly think of themselves and other negroes as just about as worthless as feces thus too many of them especially the middle class which should be setting a worthwhile model and contributing sound leadership merely overidentify with the white world then frantically struggle to ape the same and to escape all traces of their negro identity see the black anglo saxons negro digest may many seem pathetically unaware of the fact that they will always be coloredand never white once i conducted a survey of negro college juniors and seniors in which a question asked was discuss the negros situation as you imagine it will be by just years from now mind you but i was amazed to note how many thought that the negro race will then be invisible or indistinguishable owing to the process of miscegenation thus these young leaders of tomorrow along with their highclass parents and peers flee desperately from their responsibility to the negro race and overconform to the trivialities of the white middle class yet being without recognition and true equality they experience a gnawing feeling of being left out of things and consequently pant after the signs and symbols of acceptance and participation too often excluded they affirm that they are not going to miss a thing and seldom do yet continue to feel that too much of the life they covet is passing them by many are the frenzied hours spent on spacious lawns and redecorated patios at getacquainted parties and gettogethers some take trips as far away as cairo egypt to get included in the act while touring abroad they frequently are able to feel like a foreigner that is a nonnegro before jetting in to their waiting jobs those unable to take such trips even on paylater plans will sponsor make believe cruises in which they pretend to stop at such points as paris hawaii or sydney australia but almost never drop their imaginary anchors in a country inhabited by negroes or black folk at home again in the united states they frequently boast that they find more in common with whites even foreigners than with members of their own race and yet they are tormented by daily reminders of conscious differences this leads among other things to a sustained clamor for invitations to gatherings thrown by bored whites who use them in their quests for the thrill of the exotic and the forbidden and to satisfy their curiosity about the negro race to offset any feeling of similarity to lower class negroes on the other hand they label highclass residential sections for negroes gold coasts even though the nearest body of water may be miles away across town in integrated neighborhoods they may feel more perturbed than whites when they look up and see other negroes moving in in their group activities they constantly collect monies to rent swank ballrooms in downtown white hotels and night clubs in the effort to intensify their feeling of apartness from lower class negroes via scented invitations to formal balls and closed banquets there they proudly devour five course meals and boast that everyone was dressed for dinner after affairs not specifically devoted to eating are over the guests typically are feted at brunches sunday mornings after allnight drinking bouts and general barrelhousing then rush off at full speed and in solemnfaced piety to the front pews of their citys most elaborate church houses to show that all of the foregoing and especially the descriptions of negro behavior to follow represent an escape from freedom on their part let us first consider the validity of our general perspective this briefly is that man while influenced by things external to himself is not a slave to his circumstances past or present where lower animals rely on instinct and the nature of the habitat man is capable of resorting to strategy and reasonthough many do not indeed mans scientific name homo sapiens is translated thinking man although scientists also toyed with then discarded the label homo loguens or talking man which admittedly characterizes the majority of negro leaders but in a fundamental sense man is distinguished from other animals by his ability to think which is in the ideal sense an important aspect of talkingand is capable of choosing between two or more ideas or alternatives rejecting one or both history let alone the biographies of individuals is a testimony to mans ability to rise above the surface of his circumstances suggesting that whenever he does not he at least in part has himself to blame for man is able to cool deserts create warmth in icelands find water beneath the earth and fire and electricity in the clouds even if it could be said that the individual is one hundred per cent controlled by his circumstances it would be difficult to prove that the negro should be so more than others how long then can we continue to rationalize the negros escape from freedom and his all too frequent lack of gall yet this very thing continues at an accelerated speed with no promise of a letup indeed the pursuit of integration itself which began as a promising means to an end has contributed to this tendency in becoming an end in itself whereas other minority groups will insist on the right of their group to exist on an equal plane as distinct categories the negro prefers to liquidate the negro altogether as fast as possible thus integration is equated with acceptance by whites and mistakenly made synonymous with legal and objective equality the socioeconomic elevation of the negro as a group and the freedom of the individual indeed it often stands in the way of both negro uplift and ironically the achievement of the integrated goal itself the university of chicago political scientist prof james q wilson has pointed out in his book negro politics that negro voters for example are characterized by apathy and seldom take the trouble to vote even where they are not restrained this is due to a sense of futility which also is responsible professor wilson found for the inability of the naacp to draw more than a handful of negroes to its mass meetings and freedom rallies and the necessity for overtaxing whites for contributions to make up for the failure of the negro community to come up to its quota at the same time the typical negro is prone to shell out his last penny to smiling white women collectors in exchange for some paper tag or emblem to wear on his coat lapel to signify that the chesty bearer has contributed to white charity professor wilson also was at a loss to explain the tendency of negroes to regard anything run by negroes as less than worthless and thus by refusing to patronize negro concerns help make their own evaluation turn out true this tendency to flee from organizations for negroes recently reached extreme proportions it seems to me when the president of a state branch of the naacp told his congregation of state con ventioners that the organization should not be called naacp the national association for the advancement of colored people but rather should be the naaap the national association for the advancement of all people apparently we may soon see the day when colored folk will be actively advancing whites indeed this is not mere speculation when the national baptist convention the largest negro religious body met recently it voted a ten thousand dollar donation to rich roosevelt university a white institution forgetting all about the small colored colleges struggling in the south it is the considered opinions of some persons that colored folk are still too poor to show off like that another curious incident grew out of the negros efforts to gain white acceptance at all costs particularly by a conspicuous display of loyalty and similarity to the white race to the point of overconformity and superpatriotism this tendency is a point welldocumented by white behavioral scientists such as gunnar myrdal author of an american dilemma and the psychotherapists abram kardiner and lionel ovessey who wrote the classic study the mark of oppression as a matter of fact i have met negroes graduates of leading universities who argued in behalf of states rights one was even peeved because negroes are not allowed in the john birch society only recently i sat in an integrated gathering and listened to a negro gentleman proclaim that he didnt believe in all these overnight changes sometimes you end up worse off than you were before he then declared his conviction that rather we should go back to the customs we followed about two hundred years ago he seemed completely stunned when reminded that he himself would then be a slave fieldhand the negros cuperfrantic quest for sameness and social acceptance is even tightening the taboo against the negro individuals freedom to shun white company if he wants to when it is offered to him for fear of being accused of holding back integration at the same time they voluntarily submit in many cases to conditions of inferiority yet think that it is because they are forced to only i will never forget the way so many negroes in san diego california when i was there as a boy during world war ii used to slink to the back seats of buses in spite of the fact that they were free to ride anywhere years later in i watched this same behavior in virginia after segregated seating rules were lifted on buses those i talked with said that they did not want to start no trouble or something to that effect i have often grown weakkneed and nauseated to see negroes cringing up to cubbyhole takeaway windows for their orders to go in the north i have watched full grown negroes calmly defy young children with pickets to enter places simply because im not going to walk way down yonder to that other store or hunh i got a charge account in there they let me have anything i want it is not hard to see that this tendency to place individual acceptance over group elevation which is a product in part of the negro individuals low regard for his own kind his desire to liquidate it and a depreciation therefore of his own sense of responsibility to it has a braking effect on the rise of the negro race in america it will take the negro far longer to acquire true freedom if he does not halt his frantic efforts to escape from it rude awakening by terrezenia like most fourteenyearold girls approaching the perplexing but wonderful age of fifteen am a dreamer dreams are good because you can escape the ugly things in life you can escape to a paradise all your own you can escape reality for a while any way sooner or later you are captured and all of the things the ugly things you wish never existed hit you right in the face hard thats what happened to me when i was running an errand for my mother one warm sunny afternoon in new jersey as i rode along the sidewalk on my bicycle everything was peaceful and quiet like it had always been in our interracial community suddenly a car speeding down the road broke the serenity i noticed it but continued to ride my bike when the car came to a screeching halt forcing the passengersa pale white man and probably his wife son and daughter forward then the man yelled to me hey i turned in his direction still riding my bike nigger he screamed his entire face turned red an awful ugly red that i dont like to remember his words cut through me like a sharp knife i got off my bike to prevent myself from falling and stared at him in horrible disbelief saying nothing then he started up his car and continued his journey down the road that man must be crazy i thought risking his own life and everyone elses just to mock me about my brown skin momentarily i lost all faith in the caucasian race i didnt trust any of them i started to run home and tell my mother but then decided to go on to the store my two younger sisters would probably think i was chicken and i didnt want that to tell the truth i was chicken i was afraid to carry out my errand because i thought maybe he would come back and do something a lot worse than calling me a name maybe he would try to shoot me a lot of crazy thoughts ran through my head and for the first time in my life i was at a complete standstill and didnt know what to do or were the thoughts really so crazy hadnt i read in the newspapers and heard on the radio about poor unfortunate negroes in the south being shot beaten and having ks carved into their backs but this was the north it couldnt happen to me or could it i suppose these thoughts had really taken an effect on me because when a car pulled alongside the road occupied by white passengers and a man asked me very politely for directions to a nearby town i just stared at him wanting to run and wondered if the first man had really come back then i realized he hadnt because there were five people in this car and there had been only four in the other one just keep going straight for about two miles i said dont make any turns and youll run right into it thanks the driver said i made a weak smile trying to act natural before i had a chance to remount my bicycle another car stopped occupied by a man woman and two childrena boy and girl the man asked for directions to a place where he could discard some rubbish he had previously passed a place where he could do just that about two hundred yards from where i was standing i jumped onto my bike and said pointing back there and rode up the street as fast as i could i looked back to see if the man was really going to dump some rubbish when the car passed by me as it did the people smiled at me it wasnt a friendly smile it was more like an imadeafooloutofyou smile or smirk i felt sorry for the two children of the man who mocked and ridiculed me it couldnt be too pleasant living with a father that found hatred in his heart so strong im glad that my parents never taught me to hate anyone especially because of something physical that could not be helped somehow im sure this man didnt try to ridicule me because of my skin color alone it has to be something else something much deeper than that maybe its because he and other whites like him resent the great increase in negro progress after so many years of slavery after only fourteen years of life half spent in a segregated southern town in alabama and the other half spent in integrated northern communities in new jersey i really cant say that im much of an authority on the subject but i do know the difference between right and wrong ive been attending integrated classes since the third grade there have never been more than four negroes in my class for a couple of years i was the only colored student in my class at first i felt a little selfconscious and different and as if i didnt belong but the other pupils were so warmhearted and friendly that soon i felt like a member of the class i made many friends that i will never forget and the teachers were all very kind and understanding now that weve moved to los angeles i miss them very much often i think of the good times we had together on class projects and trips these students over fivesixths of them white never once called me a name relating to my race and color i invited the mayors niece along with other white and colored friends to some of my parties and we had a wonderful time we hardly ever discussed racial conflicts and problems arising in the south and i couldnt fully understand about the sitinners and freedom riders because i had not experienced what they were going through i couldnt understand why such a fuss was made over who rode in the front of the bus and who rode in the back and who ate at lunch counters and who couldnt and why colored and white children couldnt attend school together without riots and police i couldnt understand because i dont remember much of my first seven years spent in the south except that i attended a segregated school and lived in a segregated community in the beginning i resented the white man who mocked me but as i grow older this resentment turns to pity in this case he was my captor he was the one who awakened me from my dream and made me face things as they really are a letter to my nephew by james baldwin i have begun this letter five times and torn it up five times i keep seeing your face which is also the face of your father and my brother i have known both of you all your lives and have carried your daddy in my arms and on my shoulders kissed him and spanked him and watched him learn to walk i dont know if you have known anybody from that far back if you have loved anybody that long first as an infant then as a child then as a man you gain a strange perspective on time and human pain and effort other people cannot see what i see whenever i look into your fathers face for behind your fathers face as it is today are all those other faces which were his let him laugh and i see a cellar your father does not remember and a house he does not remember and i hear in his present laughter his laughter as a child let him curse and i remember his falling down the cellar steps and howling and i remember with pain his tears which my hand or your grandmothers hand so easily wiped away but no ones hand can wioe away those tears he sheds invisibly today which one hears in his laughter and in his speech and in his songs i know what the world has done to my brother and how narrowly he has survived it and i know which is much worse and this is the crime of which i accuse my country and my countrymen and for which neither i nor time nor history will ever forgive them that they have destroyed and are destroying hundreds of thousands of lives and do not know it and do not want to know it one can be indeed one must strive to becometough and philosophical concerning destruction and death for this is what most of mankind has been best at since we have heard of war remember i said most of mankind but it is not permissible that the authors of devastation should also be innocent it is the innocence which constitutes the crime now my dear namesake these innocent and well meaning people your countrymen have caused you to be born under conditions not far removed from those described for us by charles dickens in the london of more than a hundred years ago i hear the chorus of the innocents screaming no this is not true how bitter you are but i am writing this letter to you to try to tell you something about how to handle them for most of them do not yet really know that you exist i know the conditions under which you were born for i was there your countrymen were not there and havent made it yet your grandmother was also there and no one has ever accused her of being bitter i suggest that the innocent check with her she isnt hard to find your countrymen dont know that she exists either though she has been working for them all their lives well you were born here you came something like fifteen years ago and though your father and mother and grandmother looking about the streets through which they were carrying you staring at the walls into which they brought you had every reason to be heavyhearted yet they were not for here you were big james named for me you were a big baby i was not here you were to be loved to be loved baby hard at once and forever to strengthen you against the loveless world remember that i know how black it looks today for you it looked black that day too yes we were trembling we have not stopped trembling yet but if we had not loved each other none of us would have survived and now you must survive because we love you and for the sake of your children and your childrens children this innocent country set you down in a ghetto in which in fact it intended that you should perish let me spell out precisely what i mean by that for the heart of the matter is here and the crux of my dispute with my country you were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced because you were black and for no other reason the limits to your ambition were thus expected to be settled you were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity and in as many ways as possible that you were a worthless human being you were not expected to aspire to excellence you were expected to make peace with mediocrity wherever you have turned james in your short time on this earth you have been told where you could go and what you could do and how you could do it where you could live and whom you could marry i know your countrymen do not agree with me here and i hear them saying you exaggerate they do not know harlem and i do so do you take no ones word for anything including mine but trust your experience know whence you came if you know whence you came there is really no limit to where you can go the details and symbols of your life have been deliberately constructed to make you believe what white people say about you please try to remember that what they believe as well as what they do and cause you to endure does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity and fear please try to be clear dear james through the storm which rages about your youthful head today about the reality which lies behind the words acceptance and integration there is no reason for you to try to become like white men and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption that they must accept you the really terrible thing old buddy is that you must accept them and i mean that very seriously you must accept them with love for these innocent people have no other hope they are in effect still trapped in a history which they do not understand and until they understand it they cannot be released from it they have had to believe for many years and for innumerable reasons that black men are inferior to white men many of them indeed know better but as you will discover people find it very difficult to act on what they know to act is to be committed and to be committed is to be in danger in this case the danger in the minds and hearts of most white americans is the loss of their identity try to imagine how you would feel if you woke up one morning to find the sun shivering and all the stars aflame you would be frightened because it is out of the order of nature any upheaval in the universe is terrifying because it so profoundly attacks ones sense of ones own reality well the black man has functioned in the white mans world as a fixed star as an immovable pillar and as he moves out of his place heaven and earth are shaken to their foundations you dont be afraid i said it was intended that you should perish in the ghetto perish by never being allowed to go beyond and behind the white mans definition by never being allowed to spell your proper name you have and many of us have defeated this intention and by a terrible law a terrible paradox those innocents who believed that your imprisonment made them safe are losing their grasp of reality but these men are your brothers your lost younger brothers and if the word integration means anything this is what it means that we with love shall force

james and godspeed your uncle james revolt and revenge by john a morsell week or so after a a violent black nationalist demonstration in the united nations in february the new york times published two lengthy background articles dealing with this recurrent manifestation of negro discontent the reporters were able to identify and interview the leaders of some thirteen groups based in new york city and adhering in one way or another to racially selfassertive programs for negro americans these groups included besides the wellknown temple of islam the socalled black muslims such names as muslim brotherhood hostile to the black muslims united african nationalist movement universal african nationalist movement african nationalist pioneer movement united sons and daughters of africa liberation committee for africa cultural association for women of african heritage provisional committee for a free africa and so on solid information regarding the numbers of people involved is unobtainable the times reporters estimated that the total might be as low as in the city itself at least half of them black muslims figures on the nationwide strength of these groups are even more elusive eric lincoln has made current a figure of for the black muslims but he concedes that this guess is based on nothing that can be subjected to verification the significance of the black nationalist groups is not however simply a matter of their numbers as a matter of fact it derives in part from the very obscurity which surrounds the estimates of size as numerous observers have noted black nationalism is an extremist manifestation which rises out of deep and ancient fear and suspicion and which is nourished by contemporary frustration at the persistence of racial discrimination if even a relative handful is sufficiently impelled to active and personally satisfying participation and particularly if partial echoes of their arguments can be heard at nearly all levels of the negro community then there is some justification for thinking that the potential for espousal of black nationalist doctrines may be a good deal greater than the ascribable organizational base suggests it is important to understand that black nationalism is not a new phenomenon in organized form it reached its peak in the universal negro improvement association founded and led by marcus garvey just after world war i there may have been as many as american negroes who enrolled as members or made contributions looking toward the establishment of an african state to be populated by black american emigres although the organization and its program failed to survive it is likely that fond memories have sent at least a few of its veterans into the presentday black nationalist camp in its african fatherland aspect even garveys movement was antedated in american history the colonization movement conducted and financed largely by proslavery elements in the decades prior to the civil war was the real forerunner despite its temporary appeal to some opponents of slavery it never flourished it was doomed by the neartotal lack of interest on the part of free negroes and by the eventual ascendency of abolitionism in the allegiance of those opposed to human bondage but the colonizationists must be reckoned the originators of back to africa it is equally important to understand something of the varied strains which have entered into black nationalism sometimes in combination sometimes indirectly and to see them in relation to the sustaining forces at work today i do not attempt here to develop a systematic analysis but am perforce content with what is largely an itemization in this should be included the rebellion against the sense of personal inferiority bred of generations of inferior status and fed by the constant exclusions disabilities and humiliations characteristic of the segregated society in which the basic orientations of most negroes are formed to escape some measure of this has been the good fortune of only a few but the urge to escape it is virtually universal many seek release in what is in all logic the most direct waynamely by creating an image of racial superiority in which the bruised personality can find solace parenthetically it may be noted i that the rallying cry for todays f black nationalism is africa and the j african heritage and there is obviously an element of contemporary accident hereie the rise of new black nations in the dark continent fixing on africa as the chief symbol of negro militancy is something of a paradox it really implies acceptance of the derogatory stereotype of the american negro as submissive and dependent the passive beneficiary of a freedom bestowed upon him peri sons genuinely free of this stereotype and adequately informed as to their history might well have chosen their heroes and heroines ii from the american negros too littleknown record of slave revolts escapes resistance to captors abolitionist crusading and valiant combat by tens of thousands in the revolutionary war the war of and the civil war and they might have reflected too that africas new states won their independence not on the field of battle but by the relinquishing of sovereignty through negotiation and under the pressure of world opinion another strain of great importance in the nurture of black nationalism is the abandonment of hope that racial justice will or can be achieved in the united states through invocation of the established process of democratic government it was the belief that the negros quest for constitutional rights had no hope of success in his or the succeeding generation that led booker t washington to preach the doctrine of negro selfimprovement rather than negro rights the conviction that negroes can never expect full equality of citizenship with the white majorityindeed that no white people can sincerely advocate such equalityis basic to the creed of the black muslims and some of the other racist groups the selfimprovement doctrine has persisted and it has numerous adherents who do not by any stretch of the imagination belong in the black nationalist category it is essentially separatist nonetheless drawing upon the seemingly unquenchable appeal of an economically selfsufficient negro community owning its own businesses and industries and in the perennial phraseology of its advocates keeping the money in our own neighborhoods it rests heavily upon the assumption that once negroes as a group have acquired their proportionate share of the nations wealth they will move as a matter of course into political and social acceptance its most common overt manifestation aside from the endless spinning of schemes for the raising of millions of dollars among negroes for investment in grandiose business proposals is the buy black movement the reference here is of course to economic selfimprovement preached as a doctrine of racial salvation obviously there can be no question of the necessity for achievement by negroes in economic affairs as in other areas of life the itemization would not be complete without a passing reference to the communist partys advocacy for many years of a separate negro state as formulated in its policy of selfdetermination in the black belt although this policy was imposed upon the american party leadership during the twenties for rigid ideological reasons and was as remote as could be from any realistic evaluation it remained in the partys program until comparatively recently evidence of communist connections in any of the nationalist groups is thus far not established and some of them are explicit in their rejection of such links communists and russians are after all mostly white people but it is most unlikely that the thought of infiltration has not at least entered the minds of the party leaders besides the racial elements in black nationalist growth there are other kinds of contributing factors of most of these it can safely be said that they would constitute sources of frustration and discontent even if every kind of purely racial discrimination were wiped out tomorrow with almost no exception black nationalist activity is urban it is most vigorous in the largest cities squalid housing a narrow range of job possibilities because of poor training low family income and the cultural aridity typical of the demoralized slumshocked fringe component of the city population are a way of life from which black nationalism seems to many to promise salvation a dim view of authority particularly as embodied in the police resentment of the more fortunate in this case middleand upperclass negroes endemic dislike of landlords shopkeepers and bosses so often jews and in any case usually white all these help to fuel the fire and to focus its heat on specified targets the grievances themselves are genuine enough the police are frequently brutal other negroes are too often insensitive to the needs of the disadvantaged and exploitation is not unknown on the part of landlords shopkeepers and employers but for the very reason that these are class not racial grievances they cannot properly be top priority items in organizational programs which are committed to the struggle against racial wrongs such problems are thus not within direct reach of the organized efforts in which aggrieved negroes are accustomed to think of themselves as being actually or potentially involved on a personal basis if however these nonracial problems can be so represented as to seem part and parcel of the racial burden per se the black nationalists hope to accomplish two things first in the minds of their followers a remote impregnable complexity will be replaced by an apparently simple and direct line of attack second the established civil_rights efforts can be exploited as whipping boys for their failure to solve all the problems that happen to affect negroes in the case of the muslim groups there is finally the explicit element of religion in a fashion made familiar by the father divine movement spiritual regeneration becomes part of the arsenal and numerous claims are made of the movements achievements in reforming thieves drug addicts prostitutes and so on there is no reason to doubt that some of these claims at least are warranted in view of the tremendous egosatisfaction derived by many adherents from their muslim affiliation beyond the buy black appeal and other activities growing out of the selfimprovement philosophy little in the way of specified objec tives and their related programs s discernible for some there seems to be nothing beyond activity intended to buttress internal morale by endless review and denunciation of the spectrum of grievances all profess to be concerned with awakening american negroes to their true ethnic status and with inculcating pride in their racial origins some do what they can along this line through meetings literature and individual example and exhortation the purely cultural manifestations often include campaigning for wider or exclusive use of african themes and artifacts in decoration negro women are called upon to abandon the hairdresser and to substitute natural modes of wearing the hair in the african style or more accurately in one of the great variety of african styles a few of the groups concern themselves chiefly with activity in behalf of what they conceive to be the best interest of the african nations they seek to interpret african needs to the american public generally and to have united states diplomatic pressure exerted in behalf of the african states and in opposition to colonial rule many of them have enshrined as patron saint the late patrice lumumba who is depicted as a black hero singlehandedly opposing the imperialist machinations of the western countries and murdered conspiratorially at the behest of those nations the closest approach to formulation of an ultimate goalie one intended to be the final solution to racial discriminationis that of the black muslims they are committed to working for the cession by the united states government of a portion of the continental united states preferably on the southeastern seaboard for settlement by negroes who will establish there a nation of their own no program of any kind has ever been announced for bringing such an event to pass although on many occasions attempts have been made to obtain one from black muslim representatives at least one group it should be noted for the record has been identified with a genuinely violent program looking to the disruption of civil authority by force this is the first africa corps sometimes known as the rastafarians originating in jamaica west indies federation and with at least one unit in new york city death sentence was pronounced earlier this year on one of its leaders who had been convicted in jamaica of the murder of two british soldiers the rastafarians however are a lone exception to the rule of professions of peaceful intent by black nationalist groups some observers have inferred an ultimate black muslim commitment to violence on the theory that they must know that peaceful requests cannot acquire for them their black slice of united states territory it scarcely seems necessary however to insist that the black muslims face up to the logical consequences of their propaganda premises they are surely not unique in their readiness to employ arguments of great emotional appeal without regard to where implementation of the arguments should logically lead southern segregationists are an eminent case in point indeed much else of what we see in the world today suggests that our age is strangely characterized by the potent allure of calls to action actionalmost any action and to intense personal commitmentalmost any commitment so long as they are intense and personal and fill the individual with a sense of purposeful involvement the need for escape from the hard work of seeking out and studying the facts which only leads to the even harder task of serious thinking and planning has made the emotional jag highly alluring to thousands and tens of thousands of peoplein this country and elsewhere for example this partly explains the massive appeal of the radical right with its substitution of nameless and ubiquitous conspiracies to fluoridate our water and poison us to promote mental health and brainwash us to lead us hypnotized down the road from free inquiry to communism for evaluation and acceptance of the realities of our national position and of the rigorous programs needed to sustain it certain special responsibilities are obviously imposed upon all of us who are in the fight for racial justice and who want it conducted with intelligence and effectiveness as well as with passion we must face the fact that logic to the contrary notwithstanding sizeable segments of the community will continue to heed the call of false prophets and with properly disturbing implications we should anticipate the strong possibility that the followers of black nationalist messiahs may become explosively frustrated when they discover that what they have bought is not hope but illusion if we understand the need not only for making such diagnoses but for performing the necessary prophylactic and restorative functions we must of course go farther at the very minimum we must never cease to be possessed by a level of moral resentment and indignation at least as high as that of the misled victims an indignation directed not so much at the false prophets as at the conditions which permit them to flourish failing in this we will not deserve and cannot arouse the confidence and respect on which our chances of being helpful rest among other things this means that we should be as deeply moved by a restricted apartment or a racial job denial or a segregationstunted mind as we are by a freedom rideand that we should see to it that others achieve the same comprehension the fact is that there are hardly any priorities the evils we face are all of a piece and we have no choice but to take them on collectively and we have very little time by joe gores hate that word i was born in boston and educated at harvard business but when i was in the army i was stationed down south and heard too much of it going back to the base after a night in town wed see them riding in the back of the bus they had their own waiting rooms rest rooms restaurants theater entrances everything here in san francisco we treat our negroes just like we treat our orientals and were damned proud of it despite anything duane duganhes from dallas texas might say barb and i have been paying the terrific rent at miss barrets just so we could have the apartment next to the dugans because duane is magnins hottest young executive and through him i hope to get their account for colt sheppard and davis but when he used that word in the elevator day before yesterday i caught him right up a what you know i hate that word duane okay buddybuddy call it the shadowed livery of the burnished sun but i tell you that one moved in upstairs yesterday be reasonable duane the cheapest apartment in the place is one seventyfive a month and the number of them that could afford he was lugging a bunch of boxes into eightysix probably just delivering a tv set or something number eightysix is the eighth apartment on the sixth floor duane and i were on four as we stepped out of the elevator duane grabbed my arm how about you being reasonable buddybuddy you know damned well that the naacp has agents out all the time guys they pay to go around just trying to get refused rooms or apartments or drinks so they can cause trouble what do you want to do for christs sake go burn a cross on his door i jerked my arm loose and went into the apartment duane might have blue eyes that can blaze like rockets and he might have played guard for smu and have forty pounds on me and he might even represent the magnin account but guys with his basic attitudes do more harm to this countrys prestige abroad than every nuclear device weve ever tested and i wasnt going to let him back me down barb wasnt home but it was a nice afternoon so i went to the back balcony and looked down at the pool it made me feel better just to see her below sunning herself with those long tanned thoroughbred legs and that honeygolden hair as pretty as a starlets hey lovely lady she looked up and waved and that wonderful smile that i always feel right down to my toes lit up her face her gesture made the slanting afternoon sun cast exciting shadows down the dip of her suit i was glad it was friday afternoon and wed be able to stay in bed late the next morning come on down the waters fine dont kid me ill bet you havent even gotten wet yet i have too i went down and in a breathless water fight made sure that she got wet after a quick plunge id gotten over my irritation with duane and had even forgotten about the negro who was supposed to have moved in the sun was still half an hour above the high redwood fence around the pool area so we stretched out sidebyside on the warm cement i was almost dozing when barb said honey has miss barret gotten herself a chauffeur or something huh then i grunted drowsily i dont know baby but the rent she charges she could afford a brace of em like russian wolf hounds and she could afford a brace of those too why an absolutely huge negro man bowed to me on the stairs today when i was coming back from the hairdressers she gave a wicked little wiggle that she never learned at bryn mawr unless it was during a certain football weekend at harvard and just before you got home i was sure i saw him again staring at me over the balcony of one of the sixthfloor apartments i was wide awake by then dont tell me youre going to start in on me too baby before colt sheppard and davis moved us out here last january i dont believe barb had seen a dozen negroes in her life i never took her slumming in harlem or even to the village during the two years we were in new york and where she comes from in connecticut you couldnt find enough negroes to field a basketball team but shes gotten this idea maybe from seeing gone with the wind too often as a kid that a negro in negro digest april a white apartment house just must be a domestic im not starting in on you herbie i just said that i saw a negro upstairs today and that i wondered im sorry i snapped baby especially on a friday night when weve got a whole weekend ahead of us and im having sexual urges its just that duane dugan claimed in the elevator today that a negro has moved in upstairs youre kidding dugan isnt hes convinced of it not only that he swears this guy is an naacp agent but you know all southerners are paranoid on the subject of negroes in general and the naacp in particular by then barb was more excited than she was last christmas over the pearls ill have paid for next year so i had to tell her the whole conversation ill bet thats just who he is she exclaimed triumphantly when id finished ill bet hes just waiting for someone to start trouble and then hell bring a lawsuit and the naacp wouldnt get to first base working that way baby not in this apartment house not with miss barret if you think theres anything about con that old gal doesnt know look at our rent but she wouldnt let go of it so i finally said all right then wench of my heart tomorrow about noon when we get out of bed were going upstairs and ask her we had a wine and candlelight dinner and it was nearly noon before we got up to the landladys yesterday as wed known she would she invited us in for cafe au lait and croissantsshe has a lot of oldworld ideas she once said that the bone structure of barbs face indicated true breedingand i opened up our subject casually with the cream and sugar say i hear that weve gotten some new tenants in eightysix miss barret is of indeterminate age stocky and grey and she wears clothes that are truly stylish and is the only woman ive ever met who can use a cigarette holder with elegance she was educated in france and once told us that at a parisian garden partythis was before world war iishe informed charles de gaulle that he had a very large nose and de gaulle responded gertrude it is not assez grand to interfere with my drinking which is all i care about with gallic gestures this always breaks barb up anyway when i asked miss barret about the new tenants her eyes lighted up and she exclaimed have you met them yet a charming couple not yet duane dugan said hed seen the husband in the hall she threw back her head and pealed out a ringing laugh something few women can do without sounding like a polly adler girl i imagine that mr dugan considering his geographical antecedents was disturbed to the point of trauma mr veli is a melanesian from the fiji islands now permanently attached to the staff of the british embassy here in san francisco but im afraid that a southerners unselective eye would see him only as a gardenvariety american negro barb glanced at me and said i guess duanes noun was more colloquial than that and some of the laughter left miss barrets eyes doubtless that is a word which i hope someday will be stricken from our language except as an historical curiosity but i fear the purgation will not occur in my lifetime nor perhaps even in yours we thanked her for the coffee and sweet rolls and got out the porsche for a drive across the golden gate to sausalito and made it back in time for an afternoon dip we didnt see either duane or the new tenants at the pool but miss barret had made us both awfully curious as we were dripping our way up the back stairs toward our apartment barb showed a flaw in her liberal education honey im a little hazy about the exact location of the fiji islands youre asking me i was five years too young for the war in the pacific but i remember reading in holiday that the fijis were close enough to tonga for trading and occasional intermarriage and i know from cinerama south seas that the tongans are lightskinned polynesians i suppose this ratu veli is a little more suntanned than average and that duanes texas imagination did the rest mmf that was all i got until we were in the apartment and towelling off in time to offenbach and then she said as if there hadnt been a break in the conversation you can say dark polynesian but i saw our mr veli in the hall yesterday you didnt and im not convinced her eyes were sparkling as they do when she gets a deliciously naughty idea shall we beard the lion in his den black lions miss smartypants arent really black im not going to get any peace until youre satisfied am i no she said complacently so after dinnerthis was last eveningwe went up their name was in the slot beside the door mr and mrs ratu veli oxen ab i wasnt sure theyd be home on a saturday night but veli answered as soon as i pushed the buzzer and barb never finished what shed started to say when the door opened we were staring at that mans pectoral muscles i am fiveeleven a tennis and my eyes were just chest level on him he was not only tall with a tremendous knot of kinky hair all over his black skull he was broad enough to have to go through doors sideways and since wed caught him wearing just a decorated cloth wraparounda sulu i read in holidayand a white shirt open to the waist i knew there was no fat on him his feet were bare each foot was as long and as broad as a ream of legal paper but their pigment in fact his overall hue was right out of the lamp shade i my name is herbert benson i got it out somehow even though my voice was strange in my own ears this is my wife barbara we live downstairs and we thought thought wed visit thought good neighbors barb was having the same trouble with her voice that i was he was so damned big and black his eyes which were soft as a does looked pleased and he stuck out a hand the size of a squash racket delighted im ratu veli his voice was beautifully modulated and incongruously british just astounding from that enormous frame he turned towards the kitchen called mother put on the tea cosy visitors and then swung back towards us and went on wonderfully decent of you chaps to pop in this way his wife called from the kitchen that shed be half a second her hands were full of cookie dough and i shot a look at barb to see if she remembered our joke about the lion because veli moved with the sinuous grace of a black_panther and saw by her face that she did i surprised another expression there too something i hadnt expected well that was the damnedest half hour ive ever spent watching barb drinking tea and eating english muffins with marmalade and showing no slightest revulsion i was so proud of her that i could have hugged her we chatted right along with them and turned down their invitations to the ballet and the little theater and a soccer game at balboa stadium in the park without being obvious about it at all we learned that veli is eight years older than i am was a noncom in the fijian scouts during world war iihe said it as though i should know what they were that the oxen ab stands for what i thought it did and that he holds the victoria cross his wife brought that up but not as if she were showing him off he sounded like a bright guy but wed learned all we had to know when his woman walked through the kitchen door my jaw muscles are still stiff from holding that awful frozen grin in place we went all the way down to our apartment and were actually inside before barb let out her breath in a big whoosh you too i asked me too were young moderns as the ladies magazines put it and im as liberal as the next girl but i dont have to repeat it all she was talking from a sort of shock and women especially american women who have had a lifetime of leisure to perfect the art can attack a female they find offensive in really vicious terms but last night i agreed with barb all the way i went halfway through the yellow pages before i found a mover who was open on sunday and i agreed to his price without haggling when i turned in the keys this morning i sure got straightened out about miss barret and her phony culture i started to say that id been recalled by phone to the head office in new york but she cut me off short i take it that in a spirit of daring and gay adventure you visited mr veli and his wife last night and his wife yes maam she had me stammering already but that has nothing to do i mean this transfer is sudden and she burst out you disappoint terribly mr benson your wife knows of this fully knows and approves yes maam i mean of course shes going with me i wouldnt be transferred without my wife and pleasespare my intelligence mr benson you may consider the week before your rent is due as sufficient notice of vacating then she took the keys from my hand and started to close the door and then opened it again and said something to me in frenchcalled me something i thinkthat i bet she didnt learn at any garden party with charlie de gaulle it made me a little sore that she wouldnt believe my explanation about why were moving tomorrow ill put in a change of address at the post office so she wont have the satisfaction of knowing that were still here in town twenty minutes ago i dug duane dugan out of bed to tell him that i was moving and to give him the name of the hotel where well be until we find a new apartment i hated to ruin his sunday morning but because of the magnin account i dont want to lose touch he answered the door barefoot and in pajamas his curly brown hair rumpled and listened to what i had to say you give us southerners a lot of heat about civil_rights but now you see what its gotten you fifty years ago one of them living like that right out in the open wed have lynched him in texas now theres nothing either of us can do buddybuddy im sure as hell not going to let him chase me out of my apartment i didnt say any more southerners are the ones who are supposed to have the intense personal pride and it wasnt his wife who was down by the swimming pool as i said ive always been for a good full life for our negroes and i always will be but i also spent two years as an enlisted man in the army and we had three of them in my barracks uneducated arrogant touchy about their color and i know all about how these people think call him a melanesian or any other euphemism you want when i see a black man living with a white woman with blonde hair and blue eyes and a peachesandcream skin and a british accent and when i see in my wifes eyes along with the disgust something she would never admit even to herself then im moving out from caution not prejudice because this ratu veli has what every black man who ever lived hungers after and the british accent and the degree from some overrated european university and the phony war medal wont make any difference his race has only evolved so far hes seen barb in a tight swimming suit and eventually hed go for her thats why its just common sense for me to move out of miss barrets thats why though i utterly loathe the thinking that inspires that word the southerners use i dont want the one in apartment eightysix living upstairs from me not when im away at the office all day not when my wife is home alone not after ive seen that expression in her eyes when she looks at him si ssi e by john a williams sissie duncan aging and gray lies dying in a los angeles hospital waiting for her two surviving children to arrive for that last visit oliver the mate of her later life stands by anxious and loving on the plane winging in from new york ralph joplin and his sister iristrying not to focus on the fearful presentremember moments from the past that past had been grim and turbulent marked with death and degradation and despair the past of the negro in america the story of ralph and iris is different however for they are not children of the south he was born in upstate new york and she was born in chicago but the difference is only one of geography and naturally being a negro man ralph knows this better than iris as a woman iris al most escaped she remembers the lewd passes the white fraternity boys used to make at her and how she felt facing the white girl sissie worked for while wearing a sweater the girl had thrown away but iris has spent the last years in europe where she is a successful singer with a big apartment in barcelona a spanish maid and a citroen and she is about as free as a negro can ever be but these people the central characters in john a williams fine new novel sissie farrar are tethered by the subtle and steely chains that bind all human beings it is one of the glowing virtues of this simple deep and moving novel that it effectively deals with the most secret and intimateand crushing relationships of sissie and her family sissie might have beenas her prototype so often is in novelsthe allprotective allknowing allsuffering mother bravely battling the cruel and uncaring world to bring up her children and to give them the chance that was denied her but john a williams is a more honest and perceiving writer than that sissie is not such a story at all sissie is a fullblown woman as frail and uncertain as most and as ignoble as many and ralph and iris the children who love her understand that though they sometimes hated her sissies journey from the rural cabin in mississippi to a middle class bungalow in california was a manyfaceted triumph and they know too despite all else that the success they have as playwright and chanteuse was founded in large measure on the strength that sissie willed them john a williams whose night song last year won him the coveted prix de rome and who subsequently became the first winner of that award refused by the american academy in rome is a mature artist gifted with and then we heard the thunder by john o killens there are all kinds of reasons for hailing and then we heard the thunder knopf john o killens new novel about negro gis in world war ii in the first place the novel is some years overdue there have been innumerable novels good and badby white writers telling the awful story of that awful war from their vantage point norman mailer that sensitive artist who sometimes now seems to be stumbling dangerously toward derangement first exploded into literary life with his own tale of trial by fire the naked and the dead john horne burns a finer and even more sensitive artist if that is possible dewhites understood negroes the frustration of educated solly saunders in his efforts to advance on merit alone in an army which judged him first as a negro and the cruel irony of men facing danger and death to destroy the twinheaded monster of fascism and racism abroad when that same monster held them prisoner at home and then we heard the thunder is not merely a protest novel as many critics are sure to term it it is a rich complex and believable story of men swept up in a stream of events both historic and violent from the reception center in new jersey to the training center in georgia and on to the pacific battlegrounds the novel moves with vitality and conviction what happened to the negros religion by the rev mr james f campbell n recent years the american negro has made great progress in civil_rights job opportunities housing and even in politics yet there is very definitely a decline in his interest and participation in religion statistics point out that more people are going to church in america today than ever before but of course this statistic is proportional and this is why it is easily refuted when referred to the negro yes there has been a population increase among negroes but at the same time the negros attendance at church and his religious enthusiasm has not kept pace with this increase at one point in the negros life religion was foremost all of his activities were centered around his religion and his church his religion gave him a sense of pride and dignity and even in his sins he felt an obligation to think and act religiously he possessed a deep consciousness of religion inwardly he believed that the things he hoped for and sought would come to him by way of his religion it may easily be said that the negro of yesteryear could be compared favorably with the jew who has always believed that god is first in life and from him comes the benefits of life there was a keen awareness of god in the negros life and his heart was rich with religious vigor but this is not true today from all indications there is a definite lag in the negros religious interests there seems to be a shyness among negroes when confronted with religion it is appalling to note the coolness that is shown throughout the nation toward the church and its activities in years gone by sunday meant going to church for the great majority of negroes and even though the statistics say america has more churchgoers today than ever before this is not true of the negro there is a drastic decline in the attendance of public worship no longer is sunday a big day for going to church todays negro would just as soon go bowling or spend the day at the beach why this is hard to figure i talked with a negro who has a top job with a science foundation his job is to travel around the nation and secure capable high school students who are interested in careers in science he told me that years ago he never failed to go to church whether he was home or away but now he says i almost never go when i asked him why he said he didnt know for one thing the problem cannot be blamed on poor leadership and church activities negro churches today have better trained ministers than ever before and they have good programs too if many of our ancestors could be restored to life again and were permitted to attend their former churches most of them would think they were in college thats just how much progress has been made in negro church life of course there is the danger of overprogramming but we cannot accuse the church of not having a problem perhaps the problem can to a degree be attributed to the negros liberation from poverty and fear the present day negro has a good income and he no longer has fear of being rejected because he knows the courts are on his side already a great number of his prayers have been answered maybe we are characteristic of the people of the old testament who after receiving deliverance from god forsook him about church attendance dont mention night worship service except for metropolitan areas with large churches and many hundreds to draw from you can almost count the number of negro churches that have sunday night services it is almost a thing of the past i will admit that there are some exceptions even in small places yet by contrast far more of the white churches proportionately are having night services i really feel that the negro has let the white man surpass him in the one thing that he alone possessed namely the integrity of religious practices why has this come about this is still hard to figure but perhaps the negros rise to social prominence has made its toll along with the negros rise in jobs and housing he has also found new meaning as a social being he has come about this with pointed interest and enthusiasm and in the process has seemingly overrun one of the most important aspects of life rather than spend his sunday evenings in church he is spending them in the homes of his friends and other places of entertainment sad as it may seem many negroes have taken an attitude of indifference toward religion it is practically an attitude of rebellion they simply dont care to be associated with any religious group there used to be a time when the negro was easily led to believe in god you could tell him that if he did not seek to live a godly life he would go to hell and this was frightening to him so consequently he sought to live daily by religious laws and beliefs but today with the great boom of liberalism and radicalism this kind of reasoning seems like folly to the negro he is far more objec tive than ever before and today he does a good job of matching an idea or a philosophy of life when you tell him something you may have to prove it he even feels quite capable of questioning divine existence years ago this was almost unheard of in the negro society except on college campuses but today this is done on a large scale freedom of belief is a great democratic ideal yet it can be very detrimental if it does not have its limits too many negroes have undoubtedly become obsessed with the idea of achieving and in so doing have denied themselves any growth and nurture from the supreme being integration has played its role too if we had the power to turn back the clock of integration we would not because integration has answered many of our hopes and aspirations but on the other hand i it too has made an apparent contri i bution to the declining religious life i of the american negro many ne i groes resent the fact that for a long i time the negro has been stigma i tized as a religionist in his quest i for integration he would like to be i accepted without being prejudged i in order to avoid this the negro i would rather appear irreligious or i even sacrilegious this seems to i be just how important total accept i ance would be to some people i any reason i have given for this i lag is not excusable in the final an i alysis this has to mean the negro has lost and abused a great privilege and a valuable asset granted all men religion when used understood and practiced wholesomely never fails to assist in making a better mankind it is something to be proud of and to improve it has been said that many times we condemn the things we passionately admire but far too often we deny ourselves of the things we really need and eventually we will discover that these things cant be done without wait till next year by howard n meyer readers who y are old enough to remember the baseball era before jackie j robinson joined the brooklyn dodgers will recall the chant that sports writers used to attribute to the local aficionados as their team finished out of the running wait till next year was the cry and even as it was uttered there was a mutual unacknowledged understanding that next year would never come during the days of my youth it never did school desegregation seems to be as hopelessly stalled today as the brooklyn baseball team ever was for over two and a half million negro children those living in the states of the former confederacy it seems that next year will never comeunless there is a drastic change in the temper of our people followed by a similar change in the conduct of our government we have just experienced the ninth september schoolopening since the supreme court affirmed the principle that racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional eight and a half years have passed since the court ruled unanimously that all provisions of federal state or local law requiring or permitting such discrimination must yield to this principle what did the ninth september produce in reviewing the first weeks developments u s attorney general kennedy commented that this was the second consecutive year in which every public school system being desegregated for the first time made this important transition without public disorder but one needs only to study the statistics to see that very little occurred except in new orleans parochial schools that would cause a segregationist to take the trouble to be disorderly the plain simple and unvarnished truth is that the united states constitution has been nullified in eleven states with only a few exceptions and token ones at that in large urban centers on the seventh anniversary of the court desegregation decision united press international described the period that had passed as the seven lean years and noted that the overall gain in terms of negro pupils in desegregated classes stood at a meager per cent the year and a half that have since elapsed give no promise that the lean years will be followed by seven fat ones the socalled regional overall average as given by the admirably objective southern education reporting service will probably remain under per cent after this years returns are in unfortunately the regional average bad as it is analyzes out to a gross overstatement of what has been really achieved the per cent figure is obtained by lumping together the socalled border states which remained loyal during the civil war with oklahoma and the district of columbia and tabulating with them the exconfederate states if the latter are taken separately as a group the following picture emerges using sers figures of the more than negro children of school age in those eleven states a gross total of were in school with white children by may of and if we exclude texas whose western region accounts for most of that states contribution to the we have ten states with a total of almost two and one half million negro school age children of whom under three thousand are in school with whites another tiny sprinkling was admitted this september whatever the final total the essential picture will remain the same another way of looking at it is from the point of view of the school board there are such groups of local public officials in the eleven states in question each sworn to uphold law and order and presumably the u s constitution only of these school boards have taken any steps toward desegregation it would seem that something must be lacking in our methods of securing compliance with law if the results to date are so disheartening there was published last year a careful and useful study of the performance of the united states district court judges in school desegregation cases in the southern states about the most serious error in the book is its title lonely men that would seem to convey the impression that it is a study of fiftyeight heroic judicial figures standing firm as isolated bastions of constitutional right not quite while there have been and continue to be notable exceptions such as skelly wright of new orleans who was promoted but because of senatorial resistance to a post in washington d cthe average district court judge has not been a lonely pillar of justice in school segregation cases the author of lonely men professor j w peltason of the university of illinois would be the first to agree that nothing could be further from the truth than this idealized picture he has studied the more than two hundred lawsuits launched over a sevenyear period in the effort to compel obedience to the requirements of the constitution at the local school board level his conclusions by and large federal judges applied the law adversely to the claims of negroes the refusal of some of the district judges to clamp down on recalcitrant boards has had a cumulatively adverse impact on the other judges the supreme court has declared public school segregation unconstitutional but many southern federal district judges had permitted the evasion of the consequences of those decisions the judges have approved programs that will keep most negroes in segregated institutions until long beyond the time when even those now starting first grade will have graduated in his book prof peltason tells us with keen insight into the nature of the judicial process just why that process cannot succeed in reforming the offending school systerns some of the obstacles encountered were inevitable builtin as it were in judicial procedure others not so foreordained nevertheless have been erected and made a rocky road wellnigh impassable there has been for example the fact that the district judge is very much a part of the life of the south the author might have been more precise and said the white south and hence reluctant even when seeking to apply the law as laid down by higher courts to take action that will arouse hostility in the community of which he is a part the effect is sometimes not easily pinpointed but there are so many ways in which by delay in holding hearings by upholding technical objections by making the path of the suitor harder in one way or another the judge can deny justice unanticipated and gave difficulties were created by the march manifesto of the ninetysix congressmen from the south who promised their constituencies to use all lawful means to resist the enforcement of law by dignifying the posture of defiance and contributing to the illusion that the supreme courts unanimous interpretation might somehow be set aside they gave the segregationists a major breakthrough school boards took due notice and the judges in the federal courts were faced with an additional inhibition and a further source of actively hostile community sentiment shortly after the little rock episode as we need to be reminded the rumor spread in washington that president eisenhower had said privately that he wished the supreme court had never ruled against segregation and had also said that he felt the southern communities should proceed more slowly confronted at a press conference with this rumor the president declared in his deathless prose i might have said something about slower but i do believe that we shouldbecause i do say as i did yesterday or last week we have got to have reason and sense and education and a lot of other developments that go hand in hand as this processif this process is going to have any real acceptance in the united states the presidents statement was hardly calculated to encourage a lonely federal judge to stand up to the segregationists a reflection of such difficulties can be seen in the retreat of the courts when faced with the pupil placement or pupil assignment laws devised in some of the resisting states to create additional obstacles to those who would take steps to vindicate their childrens constitutional rights in court these are probably the greatest and most enduring of all the obstacles to school desegregation erected during the seven lean years just past and it is a fair statement that until they are broken down the device of token desegregation will stall further progress some twenty years ago an eminent sociologist an associate of gunnar myrdal wrote that the american south is the only place in the world today where one can get a reputation for being a liberal simply by urging obedience to law and where conservatives regularly violate the law true as this statement remains today it needs to be elaborated by the addition of another aspect one can get a reputation as a moderate by urging the community to pretend to obey the law by token compliance what of the future the kennedy administration which has in many ways lived up to its campaign pledges to act against discrimination on every front has not changed significantly the course of events spotlighted in lonely men it was not long after his induction that the new attorney general speaking in georgia forthrightly declared that if the orders of the court are circumvented the department of justice will act we will not stand by or be aloof we will move however the civil_rights crisis in the schools is not so much due to the circumvention of i existing court orders as it is to the i difficulty of securing meaningful i court orders and enough of them i it took two hundred lawsuits i each one privately financed to gain i the admission of the handful of stu i dents who have entered a few i schools not only must each law i suit be privately financed but in i each case a family or group of families must come forward separately in each school district and face the threat of economic reprisals or worse will we ever know the full story of what happened to the negro families whose children at first entered and then withdrew from the parochial school at buras to have a profound and revolutionary readjustment of race relations in the schools depend on privately financed lawsuits with volunteer plaintiffs is utterly unsatisfactory except as professor peltason points out to the segregationists negroes lack the political power to force school boards to integrate their only choice is to litigate and to persuade a judge to command the board to act segregationists do not fear this as long as the national government does not interfere there will obviously be no change in the school situation until there is new legislation there have been plenty of proposals but the kennedy administration has not as yet seen fit to identify itself with any one of them or put forward any of its own presumably the administration has refrained from asking for new legislation in respect to school desegregation either because of a fear of adverse effect on the balance of the legislative program or because of lack of prospect of passage yet it is hard to see how the presidents program could have fared much worse as to lack of prospect of passage it would seem that if the administration were to have brought the facts to the people there might have been a reaction strong enough to get some sort of legislation the eisenhower administration produced civil_rights laws on the subject of voting that while far from perfect or complete have given attorney general kennedy and his civil_rights chief burke marshall tools to move in on the grosser instances of disenfranchisement early in the kennedy administration the congress gave the president an unusual chance to eliminate roadblocks in civil_rights litigation but the opportunity was not seized upon there had developed in the last years of the eisenhower administration a great need for additional federal judgeships throughout the united states to meet the problem of overloaded dockets and court congestion on may the omnibus judgeship bill was passed creating seventythree new federal court posts of these twentynine vacancies were to be filled in states with recurrent civil_rights problems unfortunately as walter dean burnham recently wrote in these pages no president is strong enough to have his way against the entrenched custom of senatorial courtesy the practical significance of that powerful political tradition is that judges appointed by a democratic president are really nominated by segregationist senators consider in this connection the number one appointment made by president kennedy under the omnibus judgeship bill that of william harold cox an associate of senator eastland it seems according to another of our national traditions that when a presidential appointee is acceptable to both of the senators from the state where he resides the rest of the senate liberal or conservative follows a courtesy practice or hands off rule when mr cox was nominated to the federal bench for the district of mississippi there was merely a pro forma hearing and no objection was raised to the nomination compare the ordeal of thurgood marshall judge coxbellwether of the appointments under the omnibus billdid not lose much time in making clear where he stood on the issues that would come before him a federal civil_rights statute of long standing has provided that a state criminal prosecution wherein civil_rights are involved may be transferred to the local federal court in order to assure protection of those rights counsel for a group of the freedom riders sought to so transfer their clients cases the move was rejected by judge cox decisions on such transfer removal cases are nonappealable so that we shall never know whether he was right or wrong in a technical sense but in his decision judge cox gave expression to selfrevealing dicta and characterizations the riders he declared judically came from other states for provocative purposes their destination was jackson but their objective was trouble this court may not be regarded as any haven for any such counterfeit citizens from other states deliberately seeking to cause trouble here among its people what provoked judge coxs denunciation was the quiet entry of whites and negroes into socalled white waiting rooms and lunch counters in interstate travel facilities unfortunately judge cox has not been the only judicial appointee foisted on the president by a democratic state organizationand approved let it be added by the american bar associationwho proved to be an embarrassment and a fierce foe of certain constitutional requirements frank ellis of the ellenderlong organization who was appointed to succeed j skelly wright in new orleans hardly waited until the latter got on the train to leave the state before voiding his desegregation orders which were later only partially reinstated by an appellate court more recent and dramatic was the performance of talmadge henchman j robert elliott of georgia who unashamedly issued without a hearing an injunction against the peaceful protest activities of the albany movement shortly afterwards there was administered the rebuke of summary revocation of his order by an appellate judge but that has not deterred judge elliott from continuing to dispense his own brand of justice these are extreme cases it would be wrong to imply that the average southern federal judge takes his oath of office with mental reservation or purpose of evasion as to the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments but the bulk of the recent appointees give no promise of departing from the pattern of conduct of the roosevelttrumaneisenhower appointees whose performance is studied and found wanting in lonely men the lesson to be derived from all this is that the federal district courts by reason of the character and origin of their personnel and limitations of the lawsuitbylawsuit method are not qualified to continue to preside over so farreaching a reform as the change in the practices of three thousand different local school boards this major social problem calls for the functioning of a single national administrative agency equipped with investigative and enforcement powers very much like those of the federal trade commission or the national labor relations board such an agency could act with speed flexibility that would enable it to cope with evasion and a forcefulness that will come from freedom from local roots and pressures it could devote itself to the singleminded pursuit of compliance with the constitution its orders to cease and desist could be enforced by the federal courts of appealwithout the intervention of a district judgeand the authority of the courts of appeal to review or revise such orders could be limited to the extremely narrow scope reserved for appeals from administrative agencies such a plan and agency would be beyond doubt constitutional section five of the fourteenth amendment expressly provides that congress shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article the right to bargain collectively is not endowed by the constitution it is merely a statutory right yet it is enforced by the effective method of administrative action why should there not be an administrative remedy for deprivation of such a constitutional right as access to an unsegregated school an agency of this nature being truly national in scope would be equipped and obliged to investigate intervene and act in the many situations at the north east and west that have been lumped together under the head of de facto segregation a national body can and should be out gunning for the northern discriminationist as well as the southern segregationist why should the underprivileged families of engel wood n j and mai verne l i los angeles and chicagoto name only a few where phases of this same problem have cropped up in various guiseshave to chip in from meager resources to pay the cost of expensive and longdrawnout litigation one should not of course be under any illusions any legislation let alone effective legislation to enforce the constitutional rights of american children will not be easy to pass it will require the development of a seething burning massive public demanda demand that is not yet in sight not until our collective conscience is aroused to action will our government respond but just as each citizen has an obligation to act to be heard from so too the president has an obligation to give us leadership when the american people are properly aroused no sectional veto or filibuster will stand in the way but as professor peltason says until those favoring school integration fight as hard for civil_rights as segregationists are fighting against them southern schools will remain segregated as long as the schools in any area remain segregated the really basic facts of race relations will remain the sameregardless of whether white lavatories at bus terminals are thrown open to all or whether the second secretary of the upper volta legation can get a meal on route these are the surface the vitals of our difficulty are largely untouchedtotal segregation in most exconfederate areas and economic and residential discrimination throughout the nation voting rights are important but school segregation is the very heart of the issue it plays an overwhelming and selfperpetuating role as both the cause and the effect of prejudice charles sumner great massachusetts senator of a century ago who saw so much so far ahead of his time stated the issue over a decade before the civil war when he vainly sought to persuade the massachusetts court to desegregate the boston school system the worst aspect of segregated schools he said is that they tend to deepen and perpetuate the odious distinction of caste founded in a deeprooted prejudice in public opinion one of the most challenging statements i ever saw on this subject was the opening of an address by the rev raymond t bosler last year on the catholic hour we americans are an impatient people he said we are proud of the fact we want results and we want them right now we are impatient about everything under the sun except one thing and about this one thing we are extremely virtuous we are not only most patient we are most prudent about it this is not the way americans ordinarily approach a problem this is untypical of america and when you come right down to it everything about the race problem is untypical it doesnt fit into the american picture and that is why we ought to get rid of it right away it is time we approached the race problem in the typical american mannerwith impatience with a determination to get results immediate results what is holding us back the recovery of by kwame nkrumah istinguished scholars it is an honour and privilege for me to welcome you to ghana and to this first africanist conference your meeting here within the ramparts of an african university is a reflection of africas recovery and reawakening it is also a recognition of the new spirit which now animates the people of this great continent it is even edifying that this congress is taking place on african soil i know that you who have gathered here represent various fields and branches of learning in fact i see familiar faces of professors of universities and academies what has impelled you distinguished scholars to gather here at such a time as this you are here and are united by the fact that you want to find out the truth about africa and when you have found out to proclaim it to the world scholarly and academic interest in africa is not a new venture the desire to know more about africa has been expressed from the very earliest times because africa has been the questionmark of history to a roman proconsul semper aliquid novi ex africa from the imaginings of the ancient geographers an inaccurate and distorted picture of africa often emerged south of the atlas ranges a sandy desert was believed to extend indefinitely with here and there a providential oasis a rivulet which nibbling and corroding its way through the sandy wastes dripped into the sea even so the ancients had some genuine knowledge of the african continent for they had a scientific curiosity about it thus erastostheses and aristotle knew that the cranes migrated as far as the lakes where the nile had its source and both of them thought that it was there that the pygmies dwelt among the travellers of the ancient world who tried to explore africa we may recall men like strabo and hanno of carthage after these early travels foreign knowledge of africa became static until a new impetus was given to it by the arabs and the chinese the arabs and the chinese discovered and chronicled a succession of powerful african kingdoms one of these kingdoms was that of ghana the pomp of whose court was the admiration of that ageand also of ours it bred and developed within its borders the instruments of civilisation and art its palaces were of solid architectural construction complete with glass windows murals and sculpture and the thrones within the palaces were bedecked with gold there were other kingdoms such as those of shonghay sala berissa the renowned empires of bornu wangara melli the historians tell us that these empires and kingdoms were maintained with remarkable efficiency and administrative competence their splendour was proverbial in mediaeval times the chinese too during the tang dynasty ad published their earliest major records of africa in the th century scholarship connected egypt with china but chinese acquaintance with africa was not confined to knowledge of egypt only they had detailed knowledge of somaliland madagascar and zanzibar and made extensive visits to other parts of africa the european exploration of africa reached its height in the th century what is unfortunate however is the fact that much of the discovery was given a subjective instead of an objective interpretation in the regeneration of learning which is taking place in our universities and in other institutions of higher learning we are treated as subjects and not objects they forget that we are a historic people responsible for our unique forms of language culture and society it is therefore proper and fitting that a congress of africanists should take place in africa and that the concept of africanism should desolve from and be animated by that congress between ancient times and the th century some european scholars forgot what their predecessors in african studies had known this amnesia this regrettable loss of interest in the power of the african mind deepened with growth of interest in the economic exploitation of africa it is no wonder that the portuguese were erroneously credited with having erected the stone fortress of mashonaland which even when barbossa cousin of magellan first visited them were ruins of long standing i have said that the pursuit of african studies is not a new experience but the motives which have led various scholars to undertake these studies have been diverse we can distinguish first a true scientific curiosity most of the persian greek and roman travelers exhibited this motive even when as in the case of the romans they had a primary military purpose they still tried and often succeeded in preserving some sense of objectivity arab explorers were also often unbiased in their accounts of africa and indeed we are grateful to them for much of what they wrote concerning our past by the time the early european writings on africa got underway a new motive had begun to inform african studies those early european works exchanged the scientific motive for one that was purely economic there was the unbalanced trade in ivory and gold and there was the illegitimate trafficking in men for which these writings needed to find some sort of excuse the point i wish to make at this stage is that much of european and american writing on africa was at that time apologetic it was devoted to an attempt to justify slavery and the continued exploitation of african labour and resources african studies in europe and america were thus at their lowest ebb scientifically with the abolition of the slave trade african studies could no longer be inspired by the economic motive the experts in african studies therefore changed the contents and direction of their writings they began to give accounts of african society which were used to justify colonialism as a duty of civilisation even the most flattering of these writings fell short of objectivity and truth this explains i believe the popularity and success of anthropology as the main segment of african studies the stage was then set for the economic and political subjugation of africa africa therefore was unable to look forward or backward the central myth in the mythology surrounding africa is that of the denial that we are a historical people it is said that whereas other continents have shaped history and determined its course africa has stood still held down by inertia africa it is said entered history only as a result of european contact its history therefore is widely felt to be an extension of european history hegels authority was lent to this ahistorical hypothesis concerning africa and apologists of colonialism and imperialism lost little time in seizing upon it and writing wildly about it to their hearts content to those who say that there is no documentary source for that period of african history which predates the european contact modern research has a crushing answer we know that we were not without a tradition of historiography and that this is so is now the verdict of true africanists african historians by the end of the th century had a tradition of recorded history and certainly by the time when mohamud alkati wrote tarikh alfattash this tradition was incidentally much much wider than that of the timbuktu school of historians and our own institute of african studies here at this university is bringing to light several chronicles relating to the history of northern ghana particularly those of alhajj usmanu of those chronicles the most exciting traced down to date appears to be the isnad alshuykh wa ilulama written around by alhajj muhama ben mustafa who lived in western gonja it gives details of the conversion of the dynasty in a great deal of interesting work has been done and continues to be done in learned centres in africa in nigeria for example dr dike has worked on politics and trade in the niger delta here he reflects like other africanist scholars a new africancentred approach to the study of the relations between the delta states and europe in the th century in this connection the collaboration of archaeologists historians and anthropologists studying different aspects of the history institutions and culture of precolonial africa has produced beneficial results a large collection of manuscripts and other evidence helping this adventure has now been made in many african centres of learning at the university of dakar for example i understand that a great deal has been collected in the way of documentary material relating to the history of the western sudan in mali also considerable work is being done on precolonial history and the museum at bamako has gathered a great deal of material both useful and fascinating in guinea too the story of the contact between europe and africa is being written as an african experience and not as a european adventure similar work is being successfully undertaken in the ivory coast in upper volta there is the important work of professor kizerbo on the moshi kingdom and he has for some months now been working happily and successfully in our institute of african studies as an expression of the cultural unity of africa in east africa a great deal of progressive work continues to be done documents and inscriptions in egez and amharic in swahili and arabic in old nubian and meroitic are being collected in order to make possible our authentic reinterpretation of our past in sudan in ethiopia in tanganyika in somalia kenya uganda everywhere in africa there is purposeful effort to bring to light those means which alone will enable us to present our history as the history of the african people the history of our actions and of the ideology and principles behind them the history of our sufferings and our triumphs this congress among other things is an attempt to share experience in this common endeavour many of these sources are documents and documents written in african languages are coming to light thus apart from hausa there are vast collections written in fufulde kanuri nupe dagbani these are mainly th century documents but they reflect a tradition of learning which goes back to the mediaeval times but our historical records do not consist alone in the facts which we committed in the arabic script every society has methods of preserving facts about its past and where a society has no literate traditions it devises rigorous methods of oral recording scholars who have studied this phenomenon know this well historical recording in africa therefore rightly comprises the documents in arabic and african languages on the one hand and on the other the wellpreserved and authentic records of oral tradition our inheritance of oral literature of epic and lyric poetry of stories and legends praise songs and the chronicles of states and dynasties preserved by palace officials is of intrinsic interest and merit as it is of historical importance the history of a nation is unfortunately too easily written as the history of its dominant class if the history of a nation of a people cannot be found in the history of a class how much less can the history of a continent be found in what is not even a part of iteurope and yet this is precisely what many a european historian has done in the past the history of africa has with them been european centred africa was only the space in which europe swelled up the african past was ignored or dismissed in these tendentious works as not contributing to or affecting the european expansion and presence in africa if africas history is interpreted in terms of the interests of european merchandise and capital missionaries and administrators it is no wonder that african nationalism is regarded as a perversion and colonialism as a virtue you who are meeting here today in the first congress of africanists are all representatives of various disciplines and are determined to pool your immense knowledge of africa for the progress of the african your efforts mark a renascence of scientific curiosity in the study of africa and should be directed at an objective impartial scrutiny and assessment of things african while some of us are engaged with the political unification of africa africanists everywhere must also help in building the spiritual and cultural foundations for the unity of our continent in east africa in the sudan in egypt in nigeria here in ghana and elsewhere the earth is being dug up apacethis time not for gold or diamonds only or for bauxite and other mineral riches but also for its rich information about our past its testimony to our achievements and its refutation of the sombre prophets of african history valuable pieces have already been unearthed including evidence of the origin of man in africa we have made our contribution to the fund of human knowledge by extending the frontiers of art culture and spiritual values democracy for instance has always been for us not a matter of a technique but more important than techniquea matter of socialist goals and aims it was however not only our socialist aims that were democratically inspired but also the methods of their pursuit were socialist if we have lost touch with what our forefathers discovered and knew this has been due to the system of education to which we were introduced this system of education prepared us for a subservient role to europe and things european it was directed at estranging us from our own cultures in order the more effectively to serve a new and alien interest in rediscovering and revitalising our cultural and spiritual heritage and values african studies must help to redirect this new endeavour the educational system which we devise today must equip us with the resources of a personality and a force strong enough to meet the intensities of the african presence and situation education must enable us to understand correctly the strains and stresses to which africa is subjected to appreciate objectively the changes taking place and enable us to contribute fully in a truly african spirit for the benefit of all african studies is not a kind of academic hermitage it has warm connections with similar studies in other countries of the world it should change its course from anthropology to sociology for it is the latter which more than any other aspect creates the firmest basis for social policy your meeting here today as africanists from various countries of the world is truly historic it emphasises the idea that knowledge transcends political and national boundaries it is incumbent upon all africanist scholars all over the world to work for a complete emancipation of the mind from all forms of domination control and enslavement a great century has come upon us no race possessing the inherent capacity to survive can resist and remain unaffected by this influence of contact and intercourse the backward with the advanced this influence constitutes the very essence of efficient progress and of civilisation from these heights of the twentieth century i again ask you to cast your eyes south of the desert of sahara if you could go with me to the oppressed congos and ask what does it mean that now for liberty they fight like men and die like martyrs if you would go with me to bachuanaland face their council of headmen and ask what motives caused them recently to decree so emphatically that alcoholic drinks shall not enter their countryvisit their king khama ask for what cause he leaves the gold and ivory palace of his ancestors its mountain strongholds and all its august ceremony to wander daily from village to village through all his kingdom without a guard or any decoration of his ranka preacher of industry and education and an apostle of the new order of things if you would ask menelik what means this that abyssinia is now looking across the oceanoh if you could read the letters that come to us from zululandyou too would be convinced that the elevation of the african race is evidently a part of the new order of things that belongs to this new and powerful period the african already recognizes his anomalous position and desires a change the brighter day is rising upon africa already i seem to see her chains dissolved her desert plains red with harvest her abyssinia and her zululand the seats of science and religion reflecting the glory of the rising sun from the spires of their churches and universities her congo and her gambia whitened with commerce her crowded cities sending forth the hum of business and all her sons employed in advancing the victories of peacegreater and more abiding than the spoils of war yes the regeneration of africa belongs to this new and powerful period by this term regeneration i wish to be understood to mean the entrance into a new life embracing the diverse phases of a higher complex existence the basic factor which assures their regeneration resides in the awakened raceconsciousness this gives them a clear perception of their elemental needs and of their undeveloped powers it therefore must lead them to the attainment of that higher and advanced standard of life the african people although not a strictly homogeneous race possess a common fundamental sentiment which is everywhere manifest crystalizing itself into one common controlling idea conflicts and strife are rapidly disappearing before the fusing force of this enlightened perception of the true intertribal relation which relation should subsist among a people with a common destiny agencies of a social economic and religious advance tell of a new spirit which acting as a leavening ferment shall raise the anxious and aspiring mass to the level of their ancient glory the ancestral greatness the unimpaired genius and the recuperative power of the race its irrepressibility which assures its permanence constitute the africans greatest source of inspiration he has refused to camp forever on the borders of the industrial world having learned that knowledge is power he is educating his children you find them in edinburgh in cambridge and in the great schools of germany these return to their country like arrows to drive darkness from the land i hold that this industrial and educational initiative and his untiring devotion to these activities must be regarded as positive evidences of this process of his regeneration the regeneration of africa means that a new and unique civilization is soon to be added to the world the african is not a proletarian in the world of science and art he has precious creations of his own of ivory of copper and of gold fine plated willowware and weapons of superior workmanship civilization resembles an organic being in its developmentit is born it perishes and it can propagate itself more particularly it resembles a plant it takes root in the teeming earth and when the seeds fall in other soils new varieties sprout up the most essential departure of this new civilization is that it shall be thoroughly spiritual and humanisticindeed a regeneration moral and eternal o africa like some great century plant that shall bloom in ages hence we watch thee in our dream see in thy swamps the prospero of our stream thy doors unlocked where knowledge in her tomb hath lain innumerable years in gloom then shalt thou waking with that morning gleam shine as thy sister lands with equal beam distinguished scholars on behalf of myself and the government and people of ghana it is my great pleasure to welcome you to ghana and to this first africanists conference to be held in africa i wish you every success the fiery voice of the negro revolt by l m meriwether e must accept the fact w that disaster is one of the terms of living whatever you get you must pay your dues white people expect the negro to pay their the white mans dues they expect the negro to suffer for them be their whipping boy then they are astounded that negroes are not happy in their places and they say my but you are so bitter those were the words spoken by author james baldwin whose latest book the fire next time has entrenched him firmly as the angry young voice of the new negro they were spoken on a california barmstorming tour the yearold novelist and lecturer recently undertook for the congress of racial equality core to raise funds for freedom in the strifetorn south at the university of california in berkeley and los angeles at the university of southern california at rallies in pasadena los angeles and san francisco an unprecedented horde of people turned out to hear this smallboned slender man with the bulging burning eyes speak calmly but with intense feeling on the american dilemma how it came into being and its solution as he saw it the atmosphere inside second baptist church in los angeles which was swollen to the rafters with an interracial crowd clearly reflected the tension and national climate of unrest all week long the newspapers and radios had kept the nation informed of the battle of birmingham and other racial conflicts which flared up in new york chicago and cincinnati speaking in this frame of reference baldwin said in essence the beginning of this country had nothing to do with the myths which have been created about it the words liberty and freedom are entirely misused the people who started this country came here for one reason and one reason only because they thought it would be better here than where they left anybody who was making it in england did not get on the mayflower part of the dilemma of this country is that it has believed the myths it has created in an effort to create the country called america today and escape the past a great many crimes were committed the first thing the settlers did when they touched these shores was to kill the indians not many american children being taught history in our schools get any real sense of how the pioneers really achieved this extermination and then they made a legend out of a massacre today americans present the spectacle of cowboys and indians on tv to reassure ourselves that there really was no crime another thing done in order to conquer the country was to enslave the africans slavery like murder is one of the oldest human institutions in enslaving the african america obtained cheap labor without which it would have had a difficult time in creating its capital the only way these christians who started the country could justify slavery was to say that a slave wasnt a man and therefore no crime was committed that lie is the basis of our current trouble it was the black mans necessity when he got here to accept the situation because he had to survive and outwit his christian masters the crime is not the most important thing what is important is that americans have spent so many generations pretending that it did not happen since society is made by man it can be remade by man but the price for this transformation is high white people will have to ask themselves precisely why they found it necessary to invent a nigger for they invented him out of necessities of their own and every white citizen will have to answer for that and every white citizen will have to realize that he is not innocent of those crimes which are being committed in his name black people will have to do something very hard too which is to love and help the white citizen in his first awkward steps toward maturity but negroes have been functioning in that capacity for a long time they were the first psychiatrists in this country at the conclusion of his speech baldwin who had received two standing ovations before he began was accorded another tumultuous ovation in the question and answer period which followed he stated that the muslim movement came into existence because white america has never kept its promises to its black citizens it is hard for any black person in this country today to arrive at a sense of his own merit he said through the muslim movement a black boy or girl can be invested with pride in being black baldwin however is opposed to the muslims because they do not work in practical areas like instituting a rent strike in harlem he also does not feel that a negro has to create the myth that he is better than white people because he is black he does not have to invent a reason to be proud baldwin said they have endured achieved and triumphed already over one of the crudest oppressions in the history of mankind i think we have every right to be proud that our mothers and fathers carried washing on their heads that they outwitted this civilization to the extent that they took the cross and made it into something which had more meaning than it ever had before they are the only mothers who have produced children who could walk through mobs to go to school i would hate to throw away this real heritage for an invented one another question directed at baldwin asked what the parents of a sevenyearold child should tell the youngster who had just confided that white people were better than negroes baldwin answered that the child was too young to have obtained this impression from the outside world so he must have gotten it in the home the answer is he said for the parents to stop trying to be white over and over he asserted that the negro must strive to become himself to find his own true identity after the rally core demonstrators marched peaceably on city hall in a sympathetic picket for the birmingham cause at a press conference at the biltmore hotel in los angeles baldwins answers to questions of newsmen were so biting that some were visibly shaken in answer to a query as to what it is that the negro wants baldwin answered heatedly no grown person has a right to ask what does a negro want you know what you want then you know what i want what does any man want i am a man discrimination against negroes he told the reporters is the central factor in american life and everything that happens here refers back to that there is no way to exaggerate the racial problem what i tell you is minuscule a microscopic bit of what the situation really is it is very grave i want the country to cease pretending that im not a part of it in defense of his claim that conditions are just as bad in the north as in the south baldwin said the negroes dont walk down the same streets as nonnegroes you may think that the courts are the same arrests are the same getting insurance is the same but it isnt asked about violence baldwin stated that whether or not there is violence depends upon the whites the negro is just a simple human being theyre not angels i dont know how much they can stand speaking to a predominantly negro audience at a luncheon sponsored by the men of tomorrow in los angeles baldwin said in essence that the negro people spend a vast amount of energy in escaping from their past from the auction block from the white mans kitchen i ran a long way before i realized that my ancestry was all i had that would help me through this world baldwin told his audience that if one embraces the past its tyrannical power ends it no longer possesses you you then possess it the negro has a tremendous debt to pay to his ancestors and the only way to pay it is to be responsible to ones contemporaries and those who come after him he said part of this responsibility is to find out ones true identity he added that many negroes in the north are completely demoralized by the age of and become hopelessly bitter they are bitter because they have been so despised no nation can afford to misuse onetenth of its natural resources baldwin added part of our responsibility the responsibility of the socalled intellectuals is to create the opportunity for these demoralized individuals to take their future into their own hands to know that a black man can be and become anything that he wishes to become baldwin calls for a total embrace between blacks and whites in order to avoid a costly conflagration this total embrace he insists must be based on mutual love and respect and upon the true history of the negros role in america and not upon myth baldwins intensity comes from the fact that he reacts emotionally to every crisis quivers at every outrage in his own words i am naked and pregnant with some strange monster although physically exhausted after his los angeles stint which also included numerous appearances at cocktail parties in beverly hills and sherman oaks where he was bombarded with questions he returned to san francisco to make a twohour documentary film which will be released later this year author of three novels the latest called another country and two other books of essays nobody knows my name and notes of a native son baldwin has been criticized by some as being too bitter and of overlooking the many gains the negro has made the oldest of nine children baldwin is the product of the ghettoes of new york an environment he despised and ran away from to europe after a tenyear exile in paris baldwin returned to the united states in with the realization that his roots were here he insists that he loves america and that is why he is angry but no longer bitter at the same time baldwin was speaking in california the united presbyterians were holding their th general assembly in des moines iowa dr marshall l scott retiring titular head criticized his constituents for moving too slow on the race issue the crux of americas racial problem he said is found in the type of neighborhoods where presbyterianism flourish it is exactly in those communities where there is the loudest talk about freedom and the most shouting about communism that the very fundamentals of our constitutional system and our biblical faith are most vigorously violated dr scott said that there is no more racial discrimination in alabama than in hundreds of allwhite communities in the north and west until our allwhite suburban communities deliberately seek to break the walls of separation that now prevail the damnedup flow of negroes from the agricultural south to the industrial north and west will pile up to sicken and possibly destroy us while other militant voices throughout the country were digesting baldwins views favorably and otherwise still others were labeling the negro movement a peoples revolution whether one agrees completely with baldwins statements or not one cannot deny that his written and spoken words are searing and penetrating if he is not the voice of this peoples revolution then he is at least a disquieting echo estevanico and the cities of gold by florence laughlin stevanico they e called hima familiar and affectionate term in the spanish language meaning little steve not because he was small in stature but because he was a giant of a man handsome intelligent and admired for his courage his origin is not known exactly some historians refer to him simply as a negro others insist that he was a moor born in azamor on the coast of morocco one thing is certain however he was a slave to one of the conquistadors and his story comes down to us as one of the most fascinating chronicles of the earliest days of exploration in our own southwest it begins almost four and a half centuries ago when estevanico sailed to the new world with the expedition of panfilo or pamphilio de narvaez in june of to search for gold and to colonize florida for the king of spain reaching the coast of florida the veteran explorer divided his forces he sent his five ships and men south toward mexico while he and the remaining together with the horses set off across the trackless jungles of florida it was a disastrous venture they met with hunger disease and the arrows or hostile indians and were forced at last to eat the flesh of their horses some managed to escape by building crude barges and sailing across the gulf of mexico but even these were shipwrecked off the coast of texas and finally of the only four remained alive and those four had the sad fate to be taken as slaves by the indians besides estevanico there were three spaniardsandres dorantes castillode maldonado and alvar nunezbetter known in history by his odd title of cabeza de vaca which means head of a cow it is cabeza de vaca in his famous book the shipwrecked ones who has given us this part of estevanicos story and a fantastic story it is little steve and his companions were undoubtedly the first explorers from the old world to cross continental united states and what amazes us in the jetage is that it took them over seven years to go from ocean to ocean after spending several months in cruel bondage to the indians in texas they managed to escape and struck westward roaming through the wilderness they traveled through new mexico into arizona and possibly reached california and in alien country they were all equal for they had only their wit and re sourcefulness to protect them from danger many of the indian tribes were friendly they thought the strangers were superior beings or gods and gave them food and gifts and the four wanderers including estevanico became known as healers wherever the spaniards went in the new world they carried the cross and tried to christianize the natives now with prayer and with what knowledge they had of medicine and possibly with a bit of mumbojumbo thrown in they healed the sick and even according to cabeza de vaca performed the miracle of bringing a chief who seemed to be dead back to life their fame spread westward and as they traveled on they were joined by innocent and friendly indians who followed adoring and laughing behind them observant young estevanico learned from the indians too he learned their languages and their customs he ate new foodsjerked deer strange roots and the sweet red fruit called tuna from the desert cactus he saw animals such as he had never dreamed of the small opossum with its curious pouch for carrying its young the great shaggy buffalo which had never before been seen by the spanish and often around the campfires he heard the exciting and wonderful tales of the seven cities of cibolathe golden cities to the north which were to play such an important part in his life and in the long history of new spain many a night estevanico must have lain awake looking up at the golden stars wondering if he would ever see the seven cities the indians had said that they were rich beyond description with great houses with many rooms and gleaming with gold to the indians turquoise stones blue as the desert sky were sacred and valuable but they knew that the spaniards preferred gold finally the little party with its happy band of followers turned south into what is now mexico and at last after seven long weary years of wandering they were united with other men from spain at the city of culiacan on the west coast it must have been a moving incident and would have been a joyous one if it had not been marred by spanish greed when some of the spaniards in port saw the friendly group of indians they decided to capture them and sell them into slavery cabeza de vaca begged for the freedom of the indians he was naturally kind and had had personal experience with oppression when he was in bondage to the indians and estevanico must have felt bitterness but regardless of protests many of the indians were taken into slavery here our three spaniards leave our story but estevanico stays with us for his greatest adventure is still ahead first he was send to mexico city to serve the viceroy there but he never forgot his adventures in the land to the north and his dream of seeing the golden cities and when the viceroy decided to send an expedition in search of the fabled cities estevanico was chosen to go along with him was a franciscan missionary father marcos de niza and a group of indian guides now it was a long way from mexico city to the seven cities of cibolaprobably close to two thousand miles and when father marco de niza reached the town of bacapa near what is now tucson arizona he decided to rest awhile but having confidence in estevanicos intelligence and experience he sent the big man on ahead with the guides telling him to send back a wooden cross if he found the trip worthwhile little steve was proud to go on ahead he was loved by the indians and made quite an impression as he proceeded farther to the north he was dressed in fine clothes and carried a staff decorated with bright feathers and dry gourds which rattled as he walked he planted crosses to mark the way for the missionary and sent back glowing reports about the riches ahead perhaps he became overconfident and because the pueblo indians in the valley were friendly estevanico became too bold north he went in arizona and east into the mountains and finally reached new mexico and at last he came to what historians now think was one of the fabled seven cities it was one of the seven villages of the zuni indians it was walled it had houses of many rooms but it was squalid and drab and dusty and the zunis eyed the approaching travelers with distrust and suspicion no explorer had ever reached their territory and they had probably never seen a dark giant of a man like estevanico he had grown too accustomed to friendly natives foolishly but bravely he entered the village he was taken prisoner almost at once and the next day estevanico was killeda martyr to the spanish hunger for gold he was the first explorer to penetrate into the wild region of the zuni and the first to reach one of the cities of cibola he found no gold but he was not the last to search for it the franciscan marcos de niza went back to mexico and told glowing lies about the richness of the fabulous cities coronado and de soto both searched for them and to this day you can hear exciting tales of the lost cities here in the west though his last adventure ended in failure this does not detract from the glory of this remarkable and fearless man mr j george hilzinger writing in a book called treasureland published in has this to say he was an honor to his race and the negro citizens of this republic should perpetuate his memory and we suggest a monument in central park new york george altman by a s doc young yearold tall l it neat two hundred pound gentleman who epitomizes a new breed among negro athletes a graduate of tennessee state a i university in nashville he is a member of the everincreasing clan of collegiates who have populated baseball since world war ii he islike the mantles musials and nicklausesa capitalist as the great manager casey stengel once remarked about his new york yankees it is impossible to contain george in a single frame of reference it takes two at least in frameofreference no the sporting news is his bible bat ball and glove are his tools major league talent is his stockintrade which brings him an estimated a year in frameofreference no the wall street journal is his bible dowjones averages are his tools investments are the product he sells unlike legions of his predecessors of infinite racial constitution george is a trailblazer for the new breed of negro athlete who prepares for his postathletic days by firming a foundation in a reputable profession while he yet wields a big stick and holds a hot hand with the fans george is in a sense as creditable a pioneer as columbus or daniel boone he is the first active negro major league baseball player to become a registered stock broker a rarefied orbit which he reached a few months ago when he passed a rigid examination administered by the new york stock exchange long before his playing days are over george will be entrenched in the stock brokerage business and if his ambitions dont play tricks on him at the conclusion of his baseball career he will slide into the intriguing world of tickertape multibilliondollar transactions and american mainstream operations without missing a baton or losing a nickel from early spring until late summer for the next eight or nine years george altman will concentrate most of his time and attention on an athletic career which has begun to assume spectacular proportions for the past two seasons he has been the leading hitter among the chicago cubs a versatile star capable of playing both outfield and infield on defense during the past offseason george was traded to the st louis cardinals whose frontoffice leaders expect him to contribute substantially to their national league pennant pursuits during the major league baseball season george will also devote his available spare time to the practice of his second profession stock brokerage he will seek prospects among all athletes whore interested in converting their sports salaries into profitable nesteggs but he will concentrate his immediate efforts on the frank robinsons willie mayses ernie bankses bill whites and hank aarons who earn more than a halfmillion dollars annually in the frontline ranks of negro stars perhaps twice that much more in the lower echelons in early fall henceforth after the world series has been committed to history and the archives of the hot stove leagues george will pack away his spiked shoes and uniform his bat and glove assume the conservative attire commonly associated with wall and lasalle streets and attempt to bat or better in the world of high finance lets backtrack to the past winter lets say you want to see george in this new world of his you enter chicagos financial district on lasalle street you search for no south and you enter the lobby of the massive building there you scan the directory of offices under as you find the name and the office number george altman you take an elevator to the eighth floor you arrive at the offices of golkin divine and fishman a stock brokerage firm which holds membership in the new york stock exchange the american stock exchange and the midwest stock exchange you enter this office and a courteous receptionist asks whom do you wish to see you say george altman please the receptionist places a call and in a matter of moments she says hell be with you in a minute you say thank you you wait meanwhile a mere glance reveals a sizeable main office of some two dozen desks manned by busy salesman many of them contributing to the general welfare of the american telephone and telegraph company or one of its affiliates in a minute as the lady promised your attention is attracted by the figure of a tall good looking neatlydressed brownskin man who is approaching you with a welcoming smile on his face a warm hand outstretched you take the hand its a strong one you are cordially invited to come in and take a seat on the other side of stock broker george altmans desk a blackboard with dowjones figures is overhead to his left an electronic board that flashes pertinent stock news throughout the day as long as the new york stock exchange remains opens is within easy view dead ahead of him the wall street journal is conspicuous in its presence on his desk as is a complicated telephone mechanism which appears to be a private switchboard this is about as far from base hits as a man can get this is big business millions of dollars in daily exchange this is the pulse of the american economy and george altman is more than an infinitesimal part of it the interview begins a rare story unfolds george altman says that if he had his college life to live over he would major not in physical education and minor in biology he would major in finance and economics he discloses that he had been interested in stocks and bonds for some time prior to joining the firm of golkin divine fishman after talking to some of my teammates he says i felt that there was a need for a competent financial person in the business pro sports whom the fellows could trust at the time of his conversation with teammates george was living in a south side chicago hotel he mentioned his ideas to a hotel executive named carl marks marks introduced him to an officer of golkin divine fishman this firm agreed to take him on as a trainee george spent three months in training following the major league baseball season he put in another three months following the season in december he was ready for the new york stock exchange examination which he passed with flying colors achieving the rank of registered stock broker during his training period george earned nothing or next to nothing from stock sales he estimates that it will take five six or seven years for him to establish himself as a stock broker to the extent that he can anticipate full livelihood from this industry but he admits i feel that im a little better off than the average salesman because im not presently depending on the commission business for my livelihood therefore im better able to put the customers welfare in front i dont have to worry about pressure selling im here to provide a service in these years between now and retirement from baseball im looking to build up a clientele a very good relationship with the people despite his affiliation with sports george altman does not plan to limit his sales pitches to the baseball fraternity i will not sell to a specialized group my service is available to all however i would like to think that i would be able to help the athletes as a group a projection reveals that if george sells to none but athletes to none but negro athletes say hell be dealing in big money working in a field of fertility the top negro major league baseball players alone earned more than in a halfdozen championship fighters such as joe louis sugar ray robinson henry armstrong ezzard charles floyd patterson and archie moore grossed well over million if george altman merely captures the negroathlete market he is in clover with the aid of special correspondence courses other diligent study and research george has become an expert on his industry this is he says a business of integrity actually many millions of dollars change hands every day without any physical handling through word of mouth through agreement the business keeps you abreast of whats happening all over the world as well as right around you everything that is of importance reflects itself in the stock market it gives you a sense of responsibility also a sense of participation in the american system of free enterprise i believe that if more of us negroes would invest in these companies those represented on stock exchanges we would have more to say about hiring and firing as part owners it goes back to the whole thing of racial equalitywe havent been participating fully there are many financial advantages to be derived from investments in stocks and bonds you can use your stocks as collateral for a loan they give you a good return on your money plus there is the allimportant factor of capital appreciation there are also taxexempt securities for substantial income earners there are all types of securities for all types of people our job is to fit the security to the person this industry is stringently regulated by both the new york stock exchange and the federal government when george is a stock broker not a baseball player he works hours a day his to day coincides with the activities of the stock market itself after that he must study research seek clients daily any time youre in the company of a person he says hes a potential prospect he adds you have to stay alert to current events things that are happeningin other words you have to try to stay on top of the news theres a lot of anticipation you have to do this entails a lot of reading and assimilating of news in his private life george altman is deeply interested in youth work he is a member of the board of directors of a chicago youth organization he is a humane person who though he would welcome riches from the stock brokerage business is a sportsman in the business as well as he is in baseball there is a fine sense of fair play of sportsmanship as well as competitiveness to be found in his carry over of attitudes and abilities from baseball to the stock market a good salesman he says is one who puts the customers interests firstalways george himself knows how embarrassing a bad investment can become with a group of ballplayers he invested in what appeared to be a lucrative chicago real estate deal a salesman approached him as he did other stars with a fancy brochure showing prime investment properties when the deal went down the ballplayers were stuck in a slum situation which cost or more of them bad publicity as well as financial losses george was one of the few who thanks to his thenlaymans interest in investments sensed that something was wrong and pulled out cash intact the fellows george says speaking of the participating ballplayers didnt know what they were getting into the man showed us a brochure i learned then that theres no substitute for investigation i tell that to all my clients you should know the situationand things that affect the situation on the subject of direct carryover between sports and the selling of stocks and bonds george said theres a definite carryover here in the stock brokerage business you have tough times you have a drought as when the market is in a down trend and people are reluctant to get into the market you might have a good solid investment and the people arent in a mood to buy its like when you go to bat with a good attitude but cant get any hits yet in neither case can you afford to become discouraged in this respect sports provides excellent training for the field im in in baseball i have confidence in myself it has paid off i believe i can become a very good broker as well like baseball this job entails a lot of work you have to get out and expose yourself in both fields i could sit at the desk two months and never get a call as in any field if you want to succeed youve got to work i have to get out visit people sell myself during an average day at this stage of the stock brokerage game george enters the golkin divine fishman office early of a morning reads the wall street journal checks the dowjones news reports checks the investment advisory news service on the day of the interview he noted that the owners of his team the anheuserbusch company of st louis were doing quite well financially and the general economic news as a golkin divine fishman representative george fits into a sales team every salesman is a part of the company he says as with any other sales organization we all work together as much as possible we receive the same financial services and advice in his role as a stock broker george altman will attempt to dispel the moreorlessgeneral notion that a person has to be wealthy in order to invest in this market a lot of people he says have the impression it takes a lot of money to invest but the bulk of investors earn an average income between and a year a person can buy as little as worth of stock every three months the mutual funds are good for small investors and others who are unfamiliar with the market it provides for the pooling of funds the money is managed by professionals investment clubs also are a good medium for those who wish to become familiar with this industry one last question is asked of george do you think that other negro athletes will follow in your footsteps once theyve heard about you george replies id like to think it will encourage other negro athletes to enter the field but they had just as well know its a tough business unless you have a sense of projection its difficult to understand how youll make it the commissions are so small itll probably take five six or seven years before i make enough to live on its quite competitive a lot of people enter it but only a comparative few stay the odds are better than to that george will stay tribute to a lady titan by william barrow hen a few months ago the wire services flashed the story that a major new york high fashion house had hired its first negro model the news stirred only a minor ripple in fashionconscious circles while the event did mark another breech in the crumbling wall of racial exclusion its impact was largely anticlimactic for the past five years followers of trends in haute couture had been watching beautiful negro girls modeling clothes by worldfamous designers all across the united states thanks to the ebony fashion fair which annually tours some cities with fabulous designs from the salons of such stylesetters as dior givenchy fontana and lanvin the image of negro women in high fashion settings was already well established needless to say the wire services had not bothered to take note back in when freda deknight then home service director of the johnson publishing company organized the first ebony fashion fair after talking her boss publisher john h johnson into supporting the idea mrs deknight set to work selecting and training models lining up local sponsors and planning an itinerary then with the confidence and determination that was characteristic of her she flew off to paris and rome for an unprecedented invasion of the ramparts of haute couture she returned in triumph with a collection of some of the most dazzling designs in europeand with a bill for her boss the ebony fashion fair is now a national institution and negro models long ago ceased to be elegant creatures of curiosity but last january the dynamic woman who had done so much to unite high fashion and negro women in the eyes and minds of the world finally surrendered to the disease against which she had been bravely struggling for years in her new york apartment where until coma claimed hershe had doggedly made plans for the ebony fashion fair freda deknight died of cancer in death the wire services at last paid homage to mrs deknight in a united press international obituary story that was published by most of the major newspapers reference was made to her contributions to the worlds of food and fashion the fact that upi mentioned her at all was testimony to her stature but the details of her truly fabulous story remained untold that story began oddly enough on a train near topeka kansas one december morning in her mother elenore alexander a traveling nurse lost her race against the stork and freda was born in transit only two years later fredas father frederick alexander a steward on the santa fe railroad died and early in her childhood freda alexander and her older sister went to live with the paul scott family in mitchell south dakota the scotts were caterers as well as farmers and they encouraged young freda in her interest in food and food preparation it was an interest which later would lead to some precedentmaking activities in the young ladys career in the years that followed freda alexander lived with a number of families in such widely separated places as mason city iowa st paul minnesota and salem south dakota in the latter town she attended school in a convent an experience which profoundly influenced her religious outlook throughout life from this school she went on to south dakota wesleyan college from which she received a degree in home economics thus prepared she launched a series of elaborate food demonstrations in the midwest traveling to new york she further prepared herself in her field by enrolling in courses at both columbia and new york universities for a time she taught sewing and served as a guidance counselor for yorkville high school and other vocational training schools in manhattan then she met and married rene deknight arranger and pianist for the delta rhythm boys it was in a year after ebony magazine was founded by publisher johnson that freda deknight joined the staff as food columnist a job that eventually led to the position as home service director for the johnson publishing company as mrs deknight liked to tell the story deliberately embellished it went something like this while visiting in chicago enroute to los angeles she was invited to dinner at the home of a wealthy couple who were longtime friends of hers shortly before the dinner hour the hosts learned that their caterer had broken a leg in an accident freda soothed her frantic hosts assured them that she would take care of everything in short order and promptly proceeded to do so sparing no expense she bought the ingredients and prepared a meal fit for royalty as fate would have it one of the dinner guests was young publisher john h johnson so impressed was he with the food that he asked mrs deknight to give him the menu hurrying off to catch her train she promised to send the menu back by mail when the menu arrived it was done in an exciting narrative style that made it seem like fun to cook publisher johnson was delighted he offered mrs deknight a job writing a regular food column for ebony and she readily accepted the feature was christened a date with a dish by mrs deknights husband and a new career was born as a date with a dish grew in popularity mrs deknights identification with johnson publishing company became more emphatic she moved to chicago and in due time expanded her influence to the fashion end of ebony magazines features two years after joining the company she collected several hundreds of her recipes and those of negro celebritiesinto a book called a date with a dish a roguish little brown chef became her trademark the book became a national bestseller from food and fashion editor freda deknight graduated to the position created for her of home service director when the johnson publishing company home offices were remodeled and expanded in the third floor became her exclusive domain she supervised the planning and preparation of fullcourse daily meals for some employes in the company cafeteria presided over the first ultramodern test kitchen in a negro publishing firm and coordinated the selection and photographing of clothes and models for all ebony features on fashion during this period mrs deknight scored a record number of firsts for a negro woman in various food and fashion organizations appeared frequently on television to demonstrate such exotic recipes as violetpetal cake and rosepetal pudding and became a familiar figure at professional food and fashion gatherings where negroes had been seen before only as servants in the course of directing and organizing fashion features mrs deknight had scouted the country for fresh young faces with the kind of figures suited for modeling one of her best known discoveries was diahann carroll whose lithe form graced many pages in ebony magazine before she became a broadway and hollywood star another discovery was cordie king the beauteous chicago girl who mrs deknight helped to groom for fashion shows prior to the advent of the ebony fashion fairs it was during the height of the national popularity of the ebony fashion fairs that freda deknight learned she had cancer in she underwent dramatic surgery in new york only days it seemed after she was discharged from the hospital she was on a plane bound for paris and the spring showings of haute couture she arrived in a wheelchair a medium of locomotion she was to use increasingly in the months that followed last year accompanied by her husband who had left the delta rhythm boys to remain constantly at her side mrs deknight flew to hawaii and then on to japan to select clothing for the show the fashion fair with an oriental flair it was the first year she was too weak to force herself to travel with the show but she kept in close touch through occasional visits to nearby cities and via phone chats with the staff early in the winter it became evident that the disease which had ravaged her once vigorous frame and which long ago would have killed a less valiant woman finally had left mrs deknight with little strength to fight said one friend who had witnessed the amazing battle without the fashion fair to worry about freda would have gone long ago and until consciousness abandoned her she did indeed plan for the upcoming fashion fair because there were so many high points in freda deknights life it is easy to overlook the low but she liked to overlook them herself she grew up almost an orphan and she worked hard and long for success and she seldom received in equal measure what she always generously gave she was often ill even before the long siege with cancer and she had known agonizing poverty but the legacies of her life are many and farreaching and one can find satisfaction in her many achievements even as one regrets her passing in a catholic digest article by margy wyvill ecclesine freda fashions and faith which appeared a few weeks before mrs deknight died it is pointed out that the ebony fashion fair is the biggest traveling fashion show in the world it might also be pointed out that a date with a dish which was published in a new edition several months before she died also is the first major cookbook by a negro however freda deknight did not rest on laurels nor did she take the time to bask in praise her energy and imagination were always directed toward the creation of something new and worthwhile her sights were set on fresh frontiers she was a titan of a lady a rare and wonderful human being integration or black nationalism by richard thorne etween civil_rights and black nationalism the two main approaches to the solution of the black americans problems at this time i would definitely say that black nationalism has the better arguments ill state why i say this but first let me clarify my contention i dont mean to say that the civil righters are all wrong and that they are in no way helping to better the black mans conditions in america such would be an exaggeration following the premise that civil righters base their program on their conclusions are valid and sound they regard the conditions of the black american as being mainly deprived of certain basic human and constitutional rights for example they say that a particular black man is penniless because he is unemployed and he is unemployed because his particular race is discriminated against on the basis of color the solution there fore is to press for fair employment rights which will allow him an equal opportunity to be employed and he thus wont have to be penniless the logic here is incontestable no one would reasonably argue with it also since recent pressurings for civil_rights have accomplished some headway in this direction it follows also that some degree of good has been done some blacks who didnt formerly have jobs now have them what then is the basis of my contention obviously it is elsewhere let us therefore look elsewhere to find it in the first place the civil righters concentrated as they are in their one specific approach ignore it seems too vast an area of the overall spectrum of sociology and the dynamics of race relations in fact because of the peculiar orientation of a civil righters thinking it is i believe quite necessary for him to ignore more than he considers i will illustrate but first looking just at the term civil_rights itself implying by definition its own objective will already give a clue as to my meaning what actually is the civil righters objective obviously it is the acquisition of those lawful rights denied him for him it is essential that he has great and uncompromising faith in the letter and the spirit of the law the u s constitution what he should be as a human being and as a dutiful american citizen and what all races in america should be is without question already spelled out for him nothing is omitted he shall not depart therefrom equally essential he must believe that the constitution at its face value is nonracial that is it doesnt cater to any one race more than the other but equally embraces all citizens white or black jew or chinese the constitution therefore becomes a nonpartial representative of the rights of all americansindeed more becomes the alpha and omega of political and social ethics of humankind itself and in it is found the future dignity and respect of the whole world incorporated in and symbolized by america now to what extent the civil righter believes this of course varies with the individual but something or another like this is believed by all of them often one will say when confronted by a black nationalist i am not just for one race i am for humanity meaning of course he is for the ideals of the constitution in thus believing the civil righter feels he stands for the freedom of all men and therefore he exalts himself in his own mind above the petty racial dissensions and nationalistic squabbles of racists he further feels that in order to solve americas racial problems it is only necessary to make whites and blacks alike see this point strong though this argument may sound it is actually very weak for again as has already been suggested it misses more than it considers in so far as the constitution might be limited and not include all the best interests of black people so the civil righter in not questioning it is also limited is the constitution then limited is it equally for the interests of all americans or does it promote the white race more than any other these are questions which must be answered if black peoples quest for dignity and freedom is to be attained let us look closer to answer them how may we do this one way i have found is to consider the premises upon which the black nationalists base their contentions in other words since my argument is that black nationalism in its outlook includes more in scope than does civil righters in theirs we need only look at those areas which black nationalism includes and which civil righters dont for example taking in a broader sociological spectrum the black nationalists feel that the white man ie the western world is embarked consciously or otherwise upon a mission to assert himself as the master and superior race of humankind he does this through various means sometimes in ways more outright and flagrant than others but always however through the bold assertion of his culture and himself along with his own physical self image upon the whole world to the extent that many nonwhite people it is pre sumed have been made to even think of god or any possible visitors from other planets as being more likely white than black what this means is that the white world in asserting itself has defined human valuesstandards of art and beauty etcand everything that men now consider of value including the terms civilization and culture themselves almost everything the world now holds dear corresponds to the white world at this point one might say so what what difference does it make which race defines human values someone has to do it why not the white race such questions however are very naive and fail to see a great many things to answer them we need only look at history which has through the process of the white race defining all human values worked out quite a bit more advantageously for the white race as a whole than it has for the darker races what happens is that when blacks born and unborn turn to the history books to see what great things their forefathers performed they find that most of the worlds great and laudable deeds were performed by the white race with very little contributed by other races and virtually nothing contributed by their own what effects this will and does have on shaping their attitudes toward the white race and their attitudes toward themselves as well as their outlooks in general are no insignificant matter it is at the core of race relations it is no doubt the very basis for both racial and individual initiative and will largely determine the direction in which initiative is taken civil righters if they are sincere in their efforts to help relieve the oppression blacks are under would do well to consider this point i have heard various misinformed americans from both races say at this point history is what it is we cant change the fact that the white race has made all of the worlds most noteworthy contributions if the black race hasnt done anything of merit it just hasnt thats all there is to it the appalling ignorance of such a remark always saddens me at the same time making me ever more suspicious of what motives the white world must have had while writing world history not writing it accurately yet when one does study history and finds how it has been written by whites in fact not quite so accurately at least it is more understandable how one could hold so mistaken a notion as the above also one might see why the person so believing could be so stubbornly committed to only the ideals of the western world yet never let it seriously be supposed that the black race is so unindustrious and uncreative as white history has made him out to be the only problem is that most of black history has lain in obscurity unknown to most blacks and whites alike it is always interesting to watch the eyes of a person formerly ignorant of black history light up when the startling wonders of africas past civilizationsthe songhay the mali the tanganyika the zimbabwe kingdoms etcare told africans of the past were always represented as being barbarians and savages semimonkeys as it were eating the flesh of other humans almost raw unclothed and with no concepts of morality fortunately however black nationalism realizing that such are but myths and distortions is promulgating the true history of africa and its people for the black nationalist now knows that history however it is written is that which largely gives a people their image of themselves and if their history is conspicuously absent in merit or superior for that matter their image of themselves will be likewise if now world history and particularly american history rather than being a chronicle of the poor race relations it has been had been a history of the equal struggles of all peoples to found a world society based on understanding and brotherhood the case for civil_rights alone would be a much firmer structure but being as it has the oppositethe chronicle of the western worlds land thefts murders and kidnappings enslavings and exploitations and in short hatred for and tyranny over the black raceit makes far less good sense for blacks to so dogmatically pursue only their civil_rights as if such were the sine qua non of any future hope they might have what they would be better busily doing besides anything else they might be doing is building themselves a surer historical foundation of their own not merely as whites would define it for them but according to their own cranial capacities to imagine what a partially black world should be like least of all should they continue to think of culture and civilization as the sum assertion of the white race only but rather as the aggregate cultures of the whole world and all races blacks should ask themselves where are their musical giants their bards of poetry and literature their sculptural and architectural contributions to the world where are their history books and their great men of renown if some day races are truly to be equal what kind of foundation ought they to be laying right now as blacks have tended to ignore these questions whites left to their own ways have come to conceive of themselves as so to speak the master builders of the world and blacks having observed no other world but that which whites have created have been more or less content to let it be that way at this point i am often led to think of the parable of the talents i recall that those servants who multiplied their talents were further rewarded while that one who buried his was reprimanded and relieved of that talent he had which servant could the black race best represent the black nationalists for good reason i think seem to feel that there are ample evidences that the white world asserts itself in the manner already stated also they feel the evidences are numerous enough to disclose which race benefits the most by it there may be some question however concerning whether all whites past and present actually advance their own race out of a conscious effort to do so and with malicious intent toward darker peoples many avid black nationalists seem to feel that they do i personally would not agree with this point of view i would say rather that the way th present racial patterns are structured circumstances will automatically work out to the advantage of the white race and to the disadvantage of the darker races i do not mean that at no time have whites consciously promoted themselves and consciously done dark peoples harm stealing land from the indians was im sure a conscious effort to do good to themselves and to do harm to the indians also the robbery of africa might have been likewise but the white of today the one who gives money to negro charity or goes on the freedom ride or secretly hopes for the end of discrimination gradual though it may be and though he himself may do precious little to help bring it about but who is sure in his own mind that he wishes blacks no harm is usually quite unaware that he is promoting values which compliment only the white race he perhaps never thinks of the constitution as being a unique and exclusive achievement of the civilization of the west he too thinks of it as being a document of universal ethics promoting the human race and hence he himself in believing in it is for humanity while he is usually quite willing to integrate his fellow black american he takes it for granted that such integration will always be inward toward the white society which is so to speak a sort of center of gravity for all better race relations he never conceives of himself moving outward toward the black society naturally he also assumes that the black in order to be worthy or acceptable will continue to polish his behavior according to the prevailing standards of the society which of course just happen to be white standards although this white does not actually hate blacks he firmly feels that manners indigenous to blacks are only at best a subculture interesting in a fashion but overall culturally below and inferior to the more desirable culture of the white society to him black nationalism especially poses a threat to the stable and sovereign world which he has come to envision as the best of all possible worlds any black who talks of recovering his peopies lost heritage and giving his allegiance to it rather than to the white world is regarded with suspicion and trepidation and literally shatters the stereotyped image of the humble and peaceloving negro he was once so familiar with such an unaccountable negro must be abnormally bitter to hold such an extremist position and if allowed to promote his aims he will undoubtedly revenge himself upon first opportunity on the whole white race indiscriminate of individuals like himself who sincerely wish blacks no harm and will thrust the whole world into violence and destruction ending forever the beautiful race relations which were in the making at the this time now of course the above may be an exaggeration but any white actually believing anything like this is just being ridiculous i would think he is psychologically and unnecessarily punishing himself for his races bloodridden conscience and crimes against the black race if any violence is at all forthcoming it is such guilt projection on the part of whites manifesting itself in imagined counteraggressive attempts to thwart black nationalism or black supremacy as such a one is wont to regard it that will precipitate it if however this white is sincere and would avert violence rather than try to physically thwart black nationalism he would try to understand it using the more commendable achievements of his own race as a clue to the aims of the black nationalists he would also stand peacefully aside mustering in his own heart all the good will possible and allow black nationalism to begin elevating the black race to a cultural status that might allow both races to proceed on a more equal footing and start building the world into a more brotherly healthy and fearless environment to live in this i say is what whites should do though i venture to say they will not for though many of them have a degree of good will toward blacks it is not that good my prediction is that the white man and the black man alike will for the most part continue to decry black nationalism both conceiving of it fearfully the former as a threat to his own culture which is being looked upon as not being good enough and the latter as some awful new social catalysis stirring up the resentments of whites and thus limiting his own chances of finally being included into the white world now if anything i have said thus far is valid the great irony of course which the civil righters have missed is that the very act of heaping laurels on the constitution only further glorifies the white world which penned it the question should be asked must the whole world come to look on the social and political ethics of the western world as being the hallmark of civilized achievement it is here that civil righters will say but are we not also americans we have been here away from africa over three hundred years what other law or ethics could we normally have these questions again are valid the main issue is in what spirit are they asked are they asked out of an earnest desire to promote the best interests of black people or are they not rather asked out of a stubborn psychological predilection for western mores and a deep ingrained aversion to all mental identification with africa and africans as when one too closely empathizes only with western culture one definite approach to answering these questions might be to isolate each question and ponder it individually for example the black civil righter might ask himself in what sense is he an american how much does black culture here in america actually have in common with black cultures in africa and the world over he should study to find out i believe that if such questions were asked and earnestly answered the civil righter would perhaps feel a greater kinship to his people in america and to blacks everywhere nor would he feel so wounded and mortally insulted when the constitution is questioned he would find it unnecessary to be quite so vitriolic toward those blacks who are in the attempted process of building a selfimage which they themselves might respect as equal to that of any other people on the earth if civil righters were willing to grant this much pressure im sure would be relieved from the black nationalists which would in turn permit them to be less extreme and radical in their approach for example black nationalists have in the past insisted that every person with black skin possesses some racial quality or essence called soul which by implication has been made out to be superior to that which whites correspondingly have yet im sure the expounders of black soul actually know that what they refer to is more cultural than racial indigenous to the psychology that mutual suffering and common environment and ancestry have created civil righters in attacking what they gladly perceive as a fallacy or loophole in the black nationalists doctrine only succeed again in missing the whole point black nationalists have i will admit expounded a rather mysticsounding virtue called soul but their attempt in doing this was never meant to imply racial superiority but was rather intended to advance that one characteristic besides color which all blacks have in common this was in response to the common cry of many blacks trying to desert the race we dont have anything in common with them for even those seeking escape the black nationalists realized were still wont to think of themselves as inheritors also of that peculiar cultural gift known as soul now if the black nationalists have not succeeded in their aim to unite the race in america it might only partially be their fault in the way they have presented themselves but the greatest failure must i believe be imputed to those who had no desire to unite with blacks they would have most likely rejected black nationalism no matter how it was presented other than the tendencies of some black nationalists to exaggerate black virtues black nationalists have on the whole essentially attempted to do much the same kind of things every other race has done to prosper the emphasis they put on racial virtues are incidental to the circumstances they find themselves in at this time without such emphasis how else might they turn the eyes of the world to regard their race which in esteem and importance time and history have all but forgotten the black nationalist is merely saying in the only way left him peoples of the world history time do not forget me i am here also significantly a part of the world if world values are being defined i insist that i be allowed to provide a part of that definition the irony of blacks saying this is admittedly very subtle and turns many of the race away from black nationalism for if blacks say that they want to help define world values they must by definition be black nationalists that is racistic and foras it is calledblack supremacy while to be for the constitution or some such embodiment of western ideals or mores which inadvertently promote the white race is to be for humanity having ourselves been reared in the western world the social implication of this is not always easy to see or is too foreign a way of thinking to risk now that we seem to be so rapidly nearing our solongsoughtafter goals this kind of thinking more prudent than courageous is understandable in view of how long blacks have suffered and waited civil righters are here embued with an old commonly held philosophy of many american blacks that of a bird in the hand is worth more than two in the bush meaning of course that civil_rights relatively in the hand are more assured than some imaginary world of the future with equal portions of all ethnic cultures in the bush but if civil righters actually feel that what they seek is more in the hand than that which black nationalists seek perhaps we may benefit by looking at it in still another way civil righters have said and i imagine felt that much of the discrimination against blacks in america stems from institutions and mores that are themselves prejudiced they say that prejudiced institutions create prejudiced mores and thus a cycle is begun and passed along to following generations what they then would do is rid america of all prejudiced institutions set up institutions that are fair to all and thus break the cycle and spare future generations these prejudiced mores although the hope is truly beautiful will this ever happen black nationalists say no an ideal they say is one thing the practice quite another what about this supposed paradise of race relations who will define it whites naturally everyone knows its not going to be defined by blacks what this means then is that all changing and molding of character to fit the social norm will be black people reshaping their own to suit the white world let us not talk about capitalism and the need for a cheap labor market but just out of curiosity what will happen to those blacks in that segment of the population which for economical or social reasons or other never quite successfully make the change from a black personality to a white will they still be persecuted will they still be the social scapegoat will they still be denied equal privileges what will happen to them or doesnt it matter will they be kept waiting will they be the black civil righters of tomorrow i will not ask whether whites will ever do any changing to suit blacks of course they wont they are already wellsuited by virtue of being white they will continue to define dress speech mannerisms hair styles the way one walks be especially sure blacks you lose that despicable hep limp that particularly characterizes the beebop or the hoodlum whites dont like it indeed all modes of human behavior whites will define who else what about history you say it too will be written by them and about them oh i see well now civil righter in that case im beginning to suspect that this paradise of future race relations might not be such a paradise after all but will be the same old america of racial snobbery and airs of superiority only now more subtle than ever and more inveterate because it went so long unchallenged and therefore harder to eradicate george washington then crossing the delaware will still be magnified in importance whereas the slave revolt of gabriel will all but be kept secret gettysburg of course will still be known but nat turner will be forgotten every american man woman and child black and white will say in unison our forefathers died there no one will say nor dare say of virginia and the slave revolt of our forefathers also died there alas not americans but only negroes died there and negroes have since been forgotten now of course the above is an exaggeration but something like this is obviously in the making so bent upon obscuring their own self image are blacks and so internally driven toward acceptance into the white world awaken civil righters in terms of racial dignity and self images these matters are far more important than you have admitted for they are questions which fall outside the ken of the constitution such questions im sure carry a social implication and set up dynamics in a society much broader than the mere question of civil or legal rights let me state this once again finally considering that people white and black receive all their attitudes and values including their values of self from the world they live what values are they likely to get when reviewing history and the world around them they find the white race at the helmsman wheel in everything and the black man if included at all usually the mere recipient of what the white race has given him i have heard some civil righters say at this point that due to the recent exploits of the new negro posterity will inevitably regard the race as militant and virile and not content with inferior social status perhaps so but how much better it would be for posterity to say that black people everywhere were always socially adhesive took pride in their own race were great artists and builders of culture and political systems that truly promoted the general happiness and above all whenever enslaved looked forever to the day they might again rule themselves this leads us to one other point by analyzing the society one might be enabled to analyze the people in it both whites and black the loyalties of one will be the loyalties of both what this means is perhaps easier to see when matters are hypothetically reversed this is to say if values were defined by blacks according to themselves and all things being equal what we would find in america would be racially opposite to what we find now the whites in the society would be modeling after the blacks in dress in speech etc kinky hair would be beautiful rather than straight hair and black skin would be considered fairer than white skin instead of violins bolstering cultured music there would be the drum the sensual and suggestive hipgrinding dances of black folk would be the most principally accepted in the society not the waltz if also the whites were socially ostracized to the same extent as blacks are now and for the reversed reasons one would find the whites looking to the ethics of the black world for their deliverance this is remember only a hypothesis it is not being advocated in this event one might also find some whites openly calling themselves white nationalists advocating pride in their own concealed history in their thin noses and lips in their own music and dances would this wonder be white supremacy if so that is exacdy what is now being promoted with no questions asked by both blacks and whites alike under the guise of simple humanitarianism believe the failure to understand this has led the struggle of blacks away from the integrity and interests of the group and outward toward socalled humanity and individualism worst it has been directly responsible for the disunity and disintegration which have plagued the black race ever since it set foot in america as long as ones whole orientation ones thoughts and ones ambitions are away from ones own people ones loyalty must of necessity be away from them also people who dont respect each other though of the same race but who seem most inclined to respect those of another race can hardly be expected to stick together there will be little cooperation between them they will be rather quick to condemn each other will sell each other out at first opportunity here you will find snitchers backbiters prosecutors of their own kind and a thick veneer of vanity and boastfulness to conceal their own shortcomings in proportion to the degree the society which they do respect ignores them and their community they will disrespect and ignore themselves you will find in short among them the very phenomena you find among the black society at this time internal bickerings social chaos despair crime a deep longing for escape toward the white world a desire to integrate to marry light to change ones own ugly blackness into a more desirable whiteness to have straight glossy hair and all the rest of the things which black nationalists have brought into focus will earmark this society which doesnt first learn to respect itself in partial summary i would like to leave several questions bent upon integration and social acceptance by white society as many blacks are what will ultimately happen to the black race in america if their aims are accomplished will it finally be absorbed into the white race is this the ultimate goal intended and last if someone challenged a civil righter who used bleaching creams and hair straighteners would he reply oh no im not just for one race i prefer lighter skin and straight hair because im for humanity was russias greatest poet a negro by homer smith as alexander pushkin w d russias greatest and p most beloved poet creator of the russian literary language an olympian among the russian literati of the early th century enemy of tyrants and lover of freedom a negro there has been much misinformation and confusion about pushkins genealogy and african racial connection to the russians he was and is a russian american negroes pardonably and understandably enough call him a negro two examples of this misinformation and confusion both by american negroes come to mind harry belafonte when he visited israel in september told the jersualem post in an interview that he wished to portray alexander pushkin in a film pushkin was half russian and half ethiopian mr belafonte stated jerusalem post september writing in the afroamerican newspapers magazine section on august john jasper stated that alexander pushkin was the son of an african general and a russian girl both of these examples immediately and clearly revealed to me that their writers had done very little or no genuine homework on alexander pushkins ancestry and as a longtime student of pushkins genealogy at the very fountainhead in russia i felt constrained to write the jerusalem post as follows it was biologically impossible for alexander pushkin to have been half russian and half ethiopian if by this mr belafonte meant that one of pushkins parents was russian and the other ethiopian concerning mr jaspers farwrong statement i wrote the afroamerican the following correction through mv research in russia i found that pushkins father was count sergei pushkin white scion of an ancient noble russian family his pushkins mother was called the lovely creole americas leading pushkinist professor ernest j simmons even goes to another extreme and denies that pushkin inherited any negro blood in his biography of the great poet professor simmons claims that pushkins first african ancestor in russia abram hannibal was an abyssinian and not a negro professor simmons even repeated the old fable that the ethiopians belong to the caucasian division of races all attempts to give pushkin a wholly caucasian family tree lineage contradict both peter the great and pushkin in a message to the russian diplomatic envoy in constantinople early in the th century peter the great requested that he be sent a young negro with good talent pushkin himself was always proud of the negro strain in his ancestry at the age of ten years before his death he began writing a historical novel based on the life of his african greatgrandfather its title was to be the negro of peter the great i recall arguing the point of pushkins negro ancestry with professor simmons on one of his visits to russia in the late s we reached no accord with professor simmons adhering to his abyssiniancaucasian descent theory an american i recollect contending should be the last person to try to deny that alexander pushkin was of negro ancestrv indeed had pushkin lived in america he would have been classified even by the united states census bureau as a negro there are millions of colored persons living in america who are far lighter in color than pushkin was and who have equally large direct infusions of caucasian bloodyet in america they are classified as negroes abram hannibal is known to have been black and to have had woolly hair and it is doubtful that peter the great would have wanted his envoy in constantinople to send him a caucasian boy the russian czar no doubt wanted the real thing a leading european pushkinist of russian descent has written that hannibal had thick lips and inkyish hair of pushkin the same authority wrote that he greatgrandson of hannibal had a mass of tight curls on his head and wide nostrils i have visited the area in northern ethiopia from which hannibal came i saw no people there even remotely resembling caucasians all around me were black people with woolly hair it is quite possible that as young hannibal grew to manhood among nobles and aristocrats in russia for statusseeking reasons he might have attempted to claim caucasian ancestry even the black woollyheaded ethiopians of today claim they belong to the caucasian branch of races and in that part of the world whence hannibal came there always has been status seeking even as there is status seeking in america today in some parts of africa and in some eastern countries many persons seek to claim ancestry from some distant legendary hero important family or aristocratic progenitor some contemporary royalty claim however circuitous to have family roots going back to mohammed founder of the islamic religion even in old russia some of the great russian nobles no doubt for status purposes claimed that a legendary and illustrious german named radsha was among the roots of their family trees another contemporary example that has some pertinence to this theme exists today out in hannibals native country ethiopias past monarchswithout any proof except a legendclaimed direct descent from king solomon and the queen of sheba and emperor haile selassie perpetuating the legend claims that he too is descended directly from solomons liaison with sheba when it is recalled that solomon lived one thousand years before the christian era and that ethiopia has had hundreds of kings since then some of them of disparate tribes and all always having kept many concubinesit is certainly farfetched and manifestly incredulous that undiluted descent could have come down from such an ancient lovenest of the king of israel this statusseeking it is possible may have had some bearing on hannibals assumption of the family name of hannibal in when he was a rising young man during his education the young african must have come across the name of the great carthaginian north african general and laid claim to ancestral ties with him some sources claimed and hannibal and pushkin supported the claimthat hannibals father had been an abyssinian prince a royal vassal of the ottoman turks this perhaps was another effort aimed at giving hannibal added status and should be looked upon with a certain amount of skepticism it is highly doubtful that the turks would have sought out and seized the son of a prince when there were so many common and nonroyalblood negro boys available in tracing pushkins african genealogy one must go back to the year peter the great was on the throne of russia the ottoman empire controlled the northern coastal region of abyssinia inland from the coast lived a negro family on the banks of the mareb river the region is known today as eritrea it was not unusual in those days for young negro boys to be captured or bought and shipped to turkey to become eunuchs in the harems of the turkish sultan and his grand vizier and other turkish potentates other young negroes were destined to grow up and become members of the janizary the sultans guard as a dashing young military officer abram gained entree to the best salons of paris where he became a great favorite especially among the french ladies he found life in france so much to his liking that when peter the great demanded that he return to russia abram always found excuses for extending his stay in france finally his excuses became exhausted and in he returned to russia peter the great was delighted at the return of his young protege who had come back as russias first fully formally educated military engineer and fortifications expert peter the great died in but not before he had appointed abram to a high engineering post in the russian army made him teacher of mathematics to the heir apparent to the russian throne and pledged him assurance that his future career was secured but shortly after the death of peter the great abram was shipped off to the russianchinese border to engage in fortifications work but when empress anna ivanovna ascended the russian throne in she recalled abram to st petersburg and aooointed him to the highranking military post of captainengineer at the fortress of pemau in russias baltic lands during his life in france abram seemingly had developed a keen eye for beautiful women and his eyes fell upon a beautiful young girl of greek descent named evdokia daughter of a greek captain in the russian navy andrei dioper the girl disliked abram had no desire to become his wife remarking in an aside that he was as negro not of our kind however back in those days the final word in such matters rested with parents captain dioper consented to abrams request for the hand of his daughter abram and evdokia were married in and it began to look as if hannibals in abram had adopted the name of hannibal descendants would be of africangreek descent but the marriage did not last long evdokia was somewhat of a flirt not uncommon in those days and hannibal accused her of infidelity they separated in as was the custom of the timeespecially when the charge was made by such an important person as hannibalevdokia was arrested not before hannibal had soundly thrashed her and secluded in a military stockade pushkin in one of his light moments remarked that the separation resulted from evdokia giving birth to a white baby girl but this allegation was without foundation for during their life together no child was born to hannibal and evdokia however she did give birth to a child but this was a few years after her separation from hannibal shortly after his separation from evdokia hannibal married christina scheberg daughter of a captain of german origin in the russian service it was rumored at the time that while hannibal was accusing evdokia of infidelity he himself was trysting with christina great compatibility and attachment marked the married life of hannibal and christina eleven children were born to them among them ossip hannibal who was to become the father of alexander pushkins mother nadezhda hannibal the lovely creole christina hannibal died in her seventysixth year abram hannibal lived on until his eightyfourth year he died honored wealthy and holder of the highest decorations that russian rulers could award i have not attempted to prove that because abram hannibal was a negro alexander pushkin must also on that account have been a negro pushkin was born felt thought and lived russian and he was as much russian as dr w e b dubois langston hughes roy wilkins thurgood marshall marian anderson frank yerby james baldwin and about twenty million other nonwhites in the united states are american nor would i be so rash as to attempt to attribute pushkins genius to his negro blood to attempt to solve the riddle of genius is an impossible exercise and it would be a no less impossible task strictly to define race within any restricted ethnological groove despite the fact that dr dubois recently adopted ghana citizenship he did not by that act divest himself of the irrevocable reality that he was born and remains american the big black burly negro by hoyt w fuller early in adolescence i fell under the spell of the freedom of the press idea which was being vaunted with patriotic fervor during those crucial days of depression and eminent war despite the nonetoosubtle opposition at home where the urging was toward the law profession i had decided with that nebulous bullheadedness which since has expanded to elephantine proportions that a journalistic career was for me already my addiction had involved me with a series of school publications and briefly with the production of an irregular appearing typewritten carboncopied newssheet which i personally circulated in my neighborhood the latter publication unfortunately was advisedly suspended after a group of young neighborhood toughs took exception to some precocious civicminded observations made about their delinquent activities this personal thwart however was not sufficient to divert my interest from the fourth estate nor it so happens was a subsequent experience which nevertheless left me considerably more skeptical and measurably less respectful of the american press at a time when most boys were content with reading the comics and scanning the sports pages at best i devoured the whole paper with passion there was not much news in the detroit daily papers about negroes except tor crime stories but this did not botner me too much the race prooiem had not yet squatted fullseat on me and furthermore both tne micnigan chronicle and the pittsourgn courier arrived every saturday to detail with hyperbolics the fortunes failings and frustrations of colored folks now it is wholly true that there were ample additional grounds for me to question the newspapers practice of those principles upon which it based its claim for nearsanctity but nobody paid much attention to such criticism in those days the american press was fair and objective in its coverage the public was toldand apparently believed for the most partand the fact that negroes were routinely ignored or relegated to back pages and special sections was not acceptable evidence to the contrary also negro reporters on white newspapers were rare indeed there being not more than one or two in the whole country and the situation had not changed appreciably several years later whenclimaxing my stubborn pursuit i received my degree from wayne state universitys school of journalism although according to my grades and the evaluation of my instructors i stood near the head of the class i was the only graduate who was not placed in a job by the school one kindly instructor conscious of the loneliness of my position was sympathetic enough to suggest that i might find suitable opportunity in india a nonwhite country which had recently gained its independence but i digress it is an earlier incident which i started out to describe so back to my adolescence because negroes were mentioned so rarely in the regular columns of the daily papers it was especially noticeable when they were mentioned at all there was a column in one of the afternoon papers in which negroes were mentioned more frequently than anyplace else it was one of those homespuntype columns written with deliberate folksiness the emphasis always on what journalism coursesi later learned refer to as human interest in other words the columnist told lots of warmhearted little stories about ordinary people their ups and downs their trials and tribulations their fun and follies for a long time i was fascinated by the negro stories in this column occasionally there were cute stories about maids and cooks and other women domestics but most of the stories concerned a big black burly negro man although the stories tended to picture this negro as somewhat slowwitted childish and amiable he nevertheless struck me as being most remarkable in a primitive sort of way he seemed to be everywhere doing just about everythingeven if he did not do these things particularly welland the white people apparently found him as lovable as they found him laughable and then one afternoon came a disillusioning light there leading off the column was a story about the big black burly negro with the strength of hercules and the heart of gold while waiting to board a streetcar the hero had come to the rescue of an aged white woman too tiny and arthritic to hoist her poor old frame from the ground into the streetcar flexing his powerful muscles and moving in the negro had ever so gently lifted the old woman bodily and deposited her inside the trolley the passengers in the car had cheered so rich in human interest and goodwill was this yarn that the columnist did whatto my knowledgehe had never done before he published the name and address of the big black burly negro and as fate would have it the man lived next door to us at first i could not believe it was true surely there was some mistake it was not possible that the dumb bumbling peripatetic negro in the column could be the man i knew our neighbor was a graduate of the university of michigan a former track star and now a teacher and athletic coach in the public school system a volunteer ymca worker a husband and father surely a man with little time for wandering around the city getting involved in human interest incidents furthermore he was anything but big black and burly he was of average height and build the color of cafe au lait with an extra dollop of heavy cream and as lithe and leanlimbed as in his college days driven by incredulousness and an overwhelming curiosity i went next door and asked our neighbor if the incident described in the column actually had happened to him there was i remember something inexpressibly sad and wise in the smile he gave me yes son i helped the old lady on the streetcar he said when i simply stared at him in obvious bewilderment he went on to explain a lady on the streetcar asked my name and i guess she phoned the paper because the columnist later called me about it he paused a moment then said i hate to say this son but now i wish i hadnt done it i didnt tell him so but i also wished he hadnt done it i went home rather inexplicably depressed and for a long while after that i couldnt read that column at all in fact even after i finally resumed reading the column i never again quite believed all of anything i read in the papers long before i ever sat in a journalism class and learned about human interest stories i was making allowances for the quality called human interest in the stories i read and even though i bullheadedly continued to pursue a career in journalism i knew all along that the more sensible thing to do to say nothing of the more profitable thing to do would have been to study law as the grownups wanted me to the way it works out freedom of the pressand the attendant responsibilityturns out to be a less sacred precept in the practice than when it is being used as a clarion call but then in these united states that seems to be about par for the course should negro women straighten their hair no yes ve stopped pressing my hair after some i years of sizzling hot combs an oftburned and always showing scalp hot weather worry and dirty grease on my pillow i have joined that growing breed of gals both negro and white who continued on page lagos firm is being a criticised for its standing order which for bids its employees to plait their hair the critics say that the order is aimed at destroying our national custom and heritage i beg to differ i think we carry this national pride a bit too far at times even to the detriment of our countrys progress nigeria is not what it was three years ago there is a tremendous change in its physical outlook this is evident by the number of huge buildings that are springing up every day when the lagos executive development board wanted to clear the slums of lagos there was a lot of hullabaloo about the scheme unprogressive people threw a lot of dirty mud at wellmeaning board members but see the new lagos and compare it with the old ive had many letters here from critics for my articles on makeup hairdo and fashion adekunle osho of lagos said in dressing we imitate the english not minding our own attractive custom theresa on her part does not like to plait her hair and she has been instructing her female readers to burn straighten her hair shameful how beautiful was my mother when i saw her last in her onidodo hair plaits and so in this twentieth century and in this age of nuclear devices the adekunle oshos and other nigerians are asking this country to stand still and not to progress in the name of national heritage for it is not only in nuclear weapons nor mechanical devices do we need to advance other things appearances and mode of living are just as important now lets take the argument of another critic j o oyelaja of ijebuode who wrote to say that parliament should legislate against the wearing of western costume i wonder how comfortable a doctor would feela woman in wrapper buba and headtie a man in one of those flowing agbadasin a theatre performing an operation the scots irish and arabs have their national dresses but a kilt is hardly seen in edinburgh capital of scotland during working hours neither is the irish orange sash worn except on special occasions and i am yet to meet a more ardent nationalist than the scot the irish or the arab i run around a lot in this job when i wear the yoruba costume i find that i spend more time than i can afford retying the headtie and the bulky wrapper round my waist and have you tried typing in an agbada i am all for nationalisation but give it to me with some comfort and improvement the fact that women of today hard working with neveramoment to spare do not have premature wrinkles around the eyes and necks is thanks to creams lotion and detergentsin other words cosmetics which killjoys like osho dont seem to like and i challenge him to tell me what is unnigerian about cosmetics the fact is that those we use today save time nigerian women have been using cosmetics as far back as preeuropean days take osun for instance women use the red paste mixed with palm oil to rub their face and body they say it gives a glowing fresh look osun is still used today in many parts of nigeria especially by women whove just become mothers and it is available in the market the only snag is nobody has improved upon it so as not to stain our clothes in the north especially and certain parts of southern nigeria women still use lalispecial leaves which are ground mixed with lime juice and wrapped round the hands and feet there is no better nail varnish than lali for it stays longer on the nails and toes but it takes a long time process which the hustle and bustle of this modern world does not permit tiro is still used by modem nigeria women but it is not handy to take about and again it requires more time and technique which the eyebrow pencil does not demand but the effect in either case is the sameto beautify the eye and surely you readers have heard of ufie made from barks of special trees edo and uli which can be applied on the lips like the modem lipstick the women of eastern nigeria wear either of these shades black red and gold on special occasions and we have the equivalent in other parts of nigeria too and so the only offense we women of today commit is using timesaving applications we still follow tradition but in the modern way finally its time we accepted english clothes not as peculiar to europe alone but the whole world in general in other words lets see them as international dresses which are worn because of their practicability lets do away with inferiority complex have turned forever from the endlesss ranks of hair processors to soap and water and a good stiff brush i who have lived for all my shorthaired life in a nightmare of goldilocks shirley temple curls ponytails and fervent prayers that id awaken one morning with long silken tresses have decided to make do with what i have the decision was not an easy one it took a lot of coaxing a lot of tears and a lot of bucking the tide of criticism and i am a terribly conventional woman my hair problem like most negro womens started some years ago with my first trip to the hairdresser with wideeyed youthfulness i sat down in the chair fully expecting to leave looking like a fairy princess it was a great shock to find afterwards that not only did i have less hair but that my scalp was showing i soon heartened a bit however when i noticed other scalps beaming at me from my schoolroom desk continued from page fully believing my hairdressers claims that she would grow my hair i suffered hopefully until a high school semester in biology revealed to me that it was all a matter of genes and inheritance with this unpleasant knowledge and a brand new electric hot comb in my suitcase i set off for college there was only one other negro girl in my dorm so on every other friday we joined forces and spent a mysterious lockedup evening in my room frying hair and fanning the air i missed one of our sessions because of a meeting so one sunday night that ill never forget i was going it all alone when my bouncyblonde next door neighbor decided to visit panicstricken i pulled on my shower cap fanned the air one last desperate time and disposed of the evidence come in come in i said as casually as possible whats that odd smell she inquired sniffing about oh i dont know i offered rather convincingly and we were off on our usual discussion of poetry and new writers now this was one of my longwinded friendships and while i was reasonably absorbed in our discussion the fact that i was only halffried with that side probably sweating away under the shower cap and that it was past midnight weighed heavily on my mind hey im going to get my pins and set my hair while we talk she announced merrily at am sleepy and thoroughly dismayed i mustered enough courage while she was gone to snatch off the shower cap and resume operations what on earth are you doing she marveled standing in the doorway i pulled her in slammed the door and answered with a bravery born of desperation pressing my hair why on earth are you doing that because it looks better well the undone side looks better to me she said proceeding to pin her hair as if i hadnt just gone through the single most harrowing moment of my life i turned to look at her and in that instant she ceased to be a college friend and became a distressingly smug white girl with the blonde hair that assured her of having more fun an intense hate and envy born of long suffering welled up in me well you pin curl your hair to change it i said venomously well i sure hope i never have to lock myself up to do it she said with a little smile we both laughedi for a reason ill never understand except maybe i was ashamed at being ashamed naturally i believed she was pulling my leg about the undone side and continued to do my own until i graduated and began working desperately wanting my hair to have that career girl look i must have gone to a halfmillion hairdressers all of whom eventually proved unsatisfactory with a perplexed scowl on their faces they either pressed my baby fine hair too straight and the curls didnt last or they didnt press it straight enough and the curls didnt last my hair along with my stomach for hairdressers slowly went to pot and finally i resumed doing it myself frustration led me to a wig which was not my bent and the revolutionary cold curl which worked just fine until i noticed that the brush rollers wound up with more hair than i had on my head i was truly at the end of my rope when i made the decision to go au naturelle i first got a close up view of the natural look at one of those open air art shows the girl was very pretty and i remember thinking at the time she looked absolutely stunning oh i had heard that it was somewhat of a rage in new yorkbut then new york was always having rages id even admired the look on entertainers like miriam makeba and odetta but i never really considered it for me in the meantime i met and married my husband who i might add is a worldtraveled raconteur of sorts and his frequent hints that he liked the au naturelle seemed only like so much conversation we live in america id answer with a laugh and cant you just see me going into my office with nappy hair my boss and everybody else would flip wisely now that i think back he always finally laughed off the issue until another time then one night we went to an au naturelle show featuring the singer abbey lincoln and several very attractive models from new york at a little gathering before the show miss lincoln remarked how her decision to go natural had done so much for her morale and i couldnt help being struck with her pronouncement that she was no longer ashamed of her hair which was impressively well groomed the show was a hit and for the first time for me so was the hairdo the models were stunning and i noticed several women in the audience who had beautifully groomed natural hairdos i also learned that night that there were different styles and different shapes of the hairdo and that it required just as much if not more care than pressed hair of course my husband seized on this opportunity and i heard about the au naturelle every day for nearly a week until he came home one day with the address of an exclusive north side hairdresser and announced that hed made an appointment for me the next day he positively assured me id be more beautiful and unable to resist that possibility i went merrily to the hairdresser the hairdresser who was white and had several other negro customers admonished me for the condition of my hair i dont know why negro women with delicate hair like yours burn and process all the life out of it he complained if youd just wash it oil it and take care of it it would be so much healthier you have no more reason to be ashamed of your hair than white women do of their straight hair i dont know how all this straightening foolishness started anyhow he argued snipping away i couldnt have been less interested in his lecture i was far too anxious for the results i was immensely pleased with my new look until i got back to the south side and faced a lot of searing looks and disapproving stares i brooded through dinner despite my husbands raving reassurance there was certainly nothing i could do but wear it it was far too short to straighten the very next day i had my first bout with open criticism i was walking along thinking about absolutely nothing when a little old mediumisticike woman walked up to me and whispered sympathetically i can grow your hair for you dearie got growing hands i flashed her a withering look and snapped i just paid five dollars to get it cut dearie she backed away in amazement and i enjoyed my first triumph over criticism the next day at work was not so simple with weak knees and a bowed head i went through what seemed an ocean of haveyougonecrazy stares one friend even took me aside to ask if id gone crazy or if i was suffering from some other exotic disease i most certainly was suffering from the illness of outspoken and insensitive people at this point i suppose i would have weakened and run home if it hadnt been for those few and foreverdeartome friends who simply smiled approvingly or said nothing they and my husband gave me a kind of strength ill always be grateful for i still dole out on the average of to a month for scalp treatments and cuts but i dont begrudge the money half as much as when i spent it to get my hair mistreated and strangely enough ive received more compliments although mostly from whites on my hair than ever before people have walked up to me and remarked you look absolutely stunning and that does my battered morale a lot of good im not so involved in the neoafrican aspects of the au naturelle look nor in the getbacktoyourheritage bit and to those fortunate healthyhaired negro girls who still press and dont have to i say onward and upward all i know is that me and my baby fine locks never looked or felt better e coming in a few minutes coming round that bend down there full speed and im gon get out my hankercher and im gon wave it down and us gon get on it and go i keep on looking for it but mama

all ready im starting to feel little better the heritage of hitler by s carter mcmorris he most abominable aspect of the hitlernazi philosophy was the doctrine of aryanismnordicism hitler never one to mince words spelled it out in mein kampf in his advocacy of a world of stratification of the races with the aryans at the very top of a dominant white race with the yellow and black races assigned to positions in that order hitler and those of his ilk were sincere in their belief in this as well as other phases of their way of life and had they won their war to make the world safe for nordicism we would have soon seen such stratification what the nazis were capable of in the way of racial improvement is demonstrated by their genocide of the jewish people it is shocking to think that in a supposedly scientific civilized world this attitude formed part of the way of life and thought of a system which came to an end only a brief sixteen years ago having been firmly propagandized into the minds of the whole nation during the nazi heyday it would be wishful thinking to suppose that such ideas have been eradicated nor of course were they original in their basic approach with hitler racism or the doctrine of inherent racial stratification has been a part of the philosophy of many individuals who have not hesitated to leave their heritage in literature and of nations which have not hesitated to impose this philosophy in action slavery was the supreme example of the latter nor is presentday racism confined to nazism at bottom the official philosophy of the southern states of this country is that negroes are inherently inferior and should be relegated to the place hitler had in store for them this fact is important for nonwhites american and otherwise for there must be a question as to what extent this southern attitude infects the american program as this nation offers itself as the leader of the western world it is the opinion of this writer that all philosophies and beliefs should find full expression even racism with logic and science eventually pointing the way to that which is valid correct and lasting so i shall attempt to rely upon scientific reasoning and simple commonsense observation to refute the very present doctrine of racial superiorityinferiority those who believe in the stratification of the races point to the backwardness or more politely underdevelopedness of africa and argue that this is inherent while the caucasian they argue has reached a higher civilization because of inherent superiority there are many scientific answers in refutation in the first place there have been periods of history when other than white civilizations were dominant or more advanced secondly just a breath ago in the history of man europeans were in a state of advance about the equivalent of darkest africa today only about years ago did the european adapt the chineseinvented gunpowder for use in war enabling them to conquer and enslave the nonwhites again there is not much question that the chinese and japanese people nonwhite are about as civilized and about as advanced technologically and economically as the european and north americans then too many countries today peopled by caucasians are classed as underdeveloped finally the development of the negro in a world which discriminates against him to a position of near educational and economic equality in america flics in the face of any attempt to explain social differences as inherently biological thus with all the odds and strikes against the american negro he has a highly respected professional class of doctors lawyers engineers teachers social workers etc many recognized leaders in their respective fields he has retail businesses banks insurance companies factories of his own the owners of some of which have reached the millionaire status although the racist argument of the south is that white children will be retarded by integration with the inferior negro in the northern schools where there has been virtually complete educational assimilation of the races much higher educational standards have been attained and maintained with negroes holding their own often excelling scholastically culturally musically athletically as for the african negro both climate and colonial exploitation have been against him and yet he has generally achieved political freedom today while there has been a concerted effort on the part of the colonialists to extend only to a privileged few of the exploited the benefits of education and culture the fact that those who have been exposed to it naturally without effort have taken on every aspect of western culture and civilization belies anything fundamental about the status in which recent history may have placed the african as for the political upheaval in the congo precedent has been set throughout modern history by the wars often civil revolutions even warring over the outcome of elections which was considered characteristic of latin nonnegro america at least until the latest times i would defend not to the death surely but to the highest courts the constitutional right of the racists to believe as they do believe and to express their beliefs more importantly i would assert their right to unemotionally objectively consider the evidence against their point of view for their problem is one of education the presentation of the best thought on the subject upon which their ignorance if not so overcome will be their destruction ignorance is not blissit is death im glad youre dead you r you by isikiah turner ie of the last remaining stalwarts of the american tradition has finally died may his old soul know eternal torment after living a long and ignoble life many no doubt will lament his passing these will say that his demise is untimely personally i will say just two words good riddance i am per fectly happy to take scriptural heed it says weep for those that are born rejoice for those that go to their reward it is said that one should not speak of the dead disparagingly i do not i speak with genuine sincerity im glad youre dead you rascal you in due respect to the departed let us make haste to bury him lest somehow the old scoundrel might be revived there are many who in all probability might contend that uncle tom was bom out of necessity that he was a way of survival be that as it may however as far as i am concerned he is dead and done and while we are burying uncle tom why not make it a double funeral let us bury the old negro image too it is time we realized that we are on the high road of a new day let us create a new image befitting our new roles we are black men we are no longer negroes we must have a spiritual and physical renaissance in our deportment on our jobs in the streets at work or at play we must carry ourselves with dignity we must know that with each degree of freedom or progress we shall make we must also take the same degree of responsibility these two arc twins they come hand in hand it is impossible to have the one without the other those of us who know our potential must feel duty bound to help a brother realize this i speak directly to that black man who by some stroke of fortune feels that he is better than his less fortunate black brother if we can not feel sincerely that we are our brothers keeper we are doomed to languish in that same chasm that others before us are trapped in neither an individual a community a nation nor a world can continue to enjoy so precious a thing as freedom while at the same time denying that freedom to others we must utilize our full capabilities in order to cope with our new duties we must throw away the crutch of selfpity that is something we can bury along with uncle tom we leaned on it much too long we must stop laughing when we are not amused we must stop scratching our bodies when we do not itch we must stop stammering when we know very well we do not have a speech impediment we must remember the fact that uncle tom is dead done and finished we black people of today we men and women of destiny we should ever be reminded that we owe the men and women of yesteryears our fathers and mothers a mighty debt a debt which can be repaid only in our taking full advantage of todays opportunities they dreamed of these days we are the media through which their dreams can become realities failure on our part to apply ourselves in every way possible means a betrayal of that trust and faith which they placed in us those heroic people paid a great and terrible price for todays advantages yes they paid for them in sweat tears labor blood and death we must not be traitors to these honored dead we know that our historical accomplishments have not been given their due recognition we feel that our contributions to our countrys greatness have been deliberately omitted from its history books may i at this time emphasize the fact to anyone who might question my loyalty this is my country make no mistake about that the blood of my fathers was poured into the mortar that holds together the bulwark of freedom which this nations foundation rests on that blood cries to me incessantly reminding me of my sacred duty to all black people who gave their lives to help to make this country great until the black man in this country is accorded full citizenship equality and justice under the law the cries of that blood shall not be quiescent by that same token i cannot have peace of mind therefore i now serve notice on all whom it may concern that until get my just due my voice will become louder and louder indeed it shall become a mighty dirge reverberating throughout the length and breadth of this vast country if i may return to our history again we people of color cannot excuse ourselves for not knowing our history i feel that those of us who do not know of our past should apply ourselves assiduously to correct that situation there are quite a few books on the market today for that purpose find them study them and learn of the many men and women of color who strode across the pages of history and distinguished themselves so nobly we cannot tell others about the nat turners the harriet tubmans the sojourner truths the dunbars the douglasses the washingtons the bannekers the delanys the bruces the smalls to mention a few if we do not know of them ourselves study our folklore search the origins of our blues and spirituals our voodooism and our old sayings you shall be richly rewarded for in them you shall know that our heritage is a very fine one indeed this experience can be electrifying it can be your personal renaissance it can make you walk talk think and act with dignity i sincerely feel that this illumination will prompt you to join me in burying uncle tom and after the planting we will make merry in the streets with singing and dancing in the best tradition of new orleans jazz we will return to the hall marching to that swinging tune i am glad you are dead you rascal you by jay scriba oung matthew henl son was glad to be a w stock boy in a washc ington d c hat store the job didnt pay much but in it was as much as an uneducated year old negro could expect matt called steinmetz one spring morning bring a size seven and threeeighths sun helmet henson hustled the hat to the front room there his employer and a customer looked at him speculatively this is the boy i was telling you about lieutenant steinmetz said the customer was a young naval officer tall and lean with cold blue eyes and a shaggy mustache he clapped the sun helmet on his head looked into the mirror and said to hensons reflection i am lt peary and im going to nicaragua to survey a proposed ships canal between the atlantic and pacific i need a responsible boy to go with me as my personal servant its jungle country a nasty climate the work wont be easy mr steinmetz recommends you do you want the job henson thought a moment then said yes sir i think id like to have it this offhand interchange established a relationship that was to be unique for lt peary was to become adm robert e peary the relentless explorer of the arctic and discoverer of the north pole matthew henson was to be with him until a year journey author floyd miller tells the story of these years in an exciting new book ahdoolo a biography of matthew a henson the negro who accompanied peary to the north pole dutton henson was remarkably mature and capable for his age to impoverished sharecroppers in maryland he had been orphaned and left in the care of a kindly friend aunt jenny he washed dishes in her restaurant and slept in the kitchen at night she tried to send him to school but young matt dreamed of adventure when he was he walked from washington to baltimore hoping to go to sea as a cabin boy a soft hearted captain took him on and for the next six years henson traveled the world aboard the merchantman katie hines the ships officers taught him first to read and write then the skills of an able seaman he learned to play the concertina and developed a good singing voice but when he was the captain died in grief henson shipped aboard a newfoundland fishing boat then went ashore to work as stevedore messenger laborer and finally stock boy in venezuela peary found henson stocky and hard muscled he wielded a machete with the best breaking trail for days through steaming jungle he became a good rifle shot and an expert canoeman he was promoted to pearys personal survey crew still peary refused to think of him as anything but a valet peary was convinced of the white mans superiority favored educated men as explorers and had romantic faith in men who had belonged to a college fraternity preferably in bowdoin his alma mater when the expedition ended peary offered henson a job as his personal messenger and a chance to accompany the first of his arctic expeditions once again however matt was entered on the ships papers as personal servant peary also took his genteel young wife and four men including dr frederick cook who would one day challenge pearys discovery of the north pole the expedition was to explore northern greenland to see if it offered a land bridge to the pole henson was to fetch and carry for mrs peary while the others explored henson handled his servant chores without complaint and was the indispensable handy man carpenter hunter and cook in greenland the eskimos whooped with glee at sight of his dark skin they treated him to feasts of rancid blubber and auks decomposed in oil andtaught him how to build an igloo drive a dog team trap a seal and cross an ice crevasse in turn matt sang and played his concertina he learned the eskimo language so much better than the whites that he became chief negotiator with these sometimes difficult people the expedition was a success and back home henson helped peary with fund raising lectures they made appearances in days and raised then in they were off again although henson found himself again reduced to flunky he became pearys chief assistant in fact if not in name and one of two men who agreed to stay north an extra winter after the first sled treks bogged down he took part in the exploration that proved greenland to be an island marching miles in days and nearly starving to death once henson saved pearys life by dragging him out of a crevasse another time he saved him by toppling a charging musk ox with his last bullet at the end the third man was too sick to think of returning to the arctic a dozen picked scientists gentlemen and fraternity brothers had started the expedition now only henson stood ready to help peary try again henceforth in his writings peary praised henson highly and referred to him as my faithful colored assistant during the next few years henson accompanied peary on several trips to greenland and the arctic peary had the drive and endurance of a man possessed but henson was tougher and in his own quiet way equally determined on one trek peary lay delirious on his sled while henson forced his eskimos to march over miles of ice in below zero weather on another peary staggered along in a daze of pain while henson kept the caravan moving hensons colored friends berated him for accepting shabby treatment without protest during a typical off summer henson worked as a pullman porter while peary vacationed on an island in maine what they couldnt understand was that henson was as emotionally committed to reaching the pole as peary stuffy as ever peary filled his last expedition ship with scholars and gentlemen adventurers the amateurs did fairly well for a time but one by one they had to turn back eyes burning from snow blindness and fingers cracked and bleeding from frostbite finally all peary had left was henson bob bartlett a bear of a newfoundland sea captain and four eskimos to peary the eskimos scarcely counted the only choice was between henson and bartlett and the latter was plainly done in once again in the moment of crisis peary found himself staring into the steady brown gaze of matthew henson the final drive for the pole in april was almost anticlimactic the expedition had leap frogged in building igloos and caching supplies so as to give the returning heroes a string of ready made camps the last camp was miles from the pole and pearys party slogged in five marches the eskimos were dumbfounded when in the midst of a desert of ice peary took a sextant sight and in a voice flat with exhaustion announced that they had reached their goal after nearly years of trying henson was in a mood to celebrate but something seemed to have gone out of peary he fell silent refused henson any show of comradeship and confined his gloating to his diary the pole at last the prize of three centuries my dream and goal for years mine at last on the return trip peary was so worn out that he often had to ride a sled henson kept the sleds moving over miles of ice but for dr cook henson might have fared better pearys party was still in greenland when word came that cook was in denmark claiming he had reached the pole a year earlier peary was furious and as the dispute became an international uproar henson was forgotten eventually most authorities agreed that cook could not have reached the pole meanwhile cook grabbed off most of the money and honors that might have trickled down to henson henson angered peary by trying to lecture on his ownand the two never saw each other again after they returned later as he was vindicated peary was showered with honors but all he ever did for henson was write a preface for his book a negro explorer at the north pole after years exploring henson became a handy man in a brooklyn garage at a week donald macmillan a white member of the expedition and later an arctic explorer in his own right badgered congress for years to get henson proper recognition four times bills were presented in washington and and four times they were bottled up in committee finally in the explorers club of new york voted henson full membership he couldnt often afford the luncheons but it was something then in years after the eventcongress struck off one medal honoring all the men on the peary expedition henson died in at after living for years on a pension of a year the synthetic was preferred by inez lawson y trunk was packed the suitcases had been squeezed shut and as soon as i said goodbye to friends neighbors and relatives i would be ready to leave the great day had finally arrived and i was leaving for college i was going in the words of family and friends to git ah edgeecation it was a privilege and an honor to be able to go soon i was surrounded by everyone and their black brown and beige faces smiled at me through misty eyes filled with pride first one and then another pecked me gently on the cheek and pressed a hardearned dollar or two into my hand with it came a few words of homely advice be a good girl study hard and learn all you can child caint nobody take ah edgeecation away from you dont talk to strange men and finally do your best honey but dont worry up there you wont even know youre black i have had more than one occasion to take exception to the latter viewpoint but that is not important now the interesting thing is that i learned there was some truth to that statementyou wont even know youre blackduring my first spring semester at college i noticed the phenomenon when the lunch room began to have a shorter waiting line around the end of april where on earth was everyone i wondered but it didnt bother me much because a shorter line meant a smaller crowd in the dining roomand that meant bigger and better second helpings one day i returned to the dorm a bit earlier than noon and as i dashed toward my room to deposit my books i was flabbergasted by the sight of countless coeds clad in shorts bras swimming suits and anything else presumably decent they were carrying sunglasses bottles eyepatches towels blankets and an assortment of other things they were all headed in the same directionthe roof there were three negro girls in landon hall we were all crowded together in a twogirl room two seniors and a forestgreen freshmanthe latter yours truly my two worldly roommates were annoyed to put it mildly at my presence in the tiny room they let me know how they felt about living with a freshman and i was worthy only of their contempt with their attitude in mind i decided it would be best not to ask them about the spectacle of seminude girls dashing toward the dormitory roof already i had a new complex i was learning about that in beginning psychology and was reluctant to ask questions i always seemed to be the only one who didnt know what was up or in this case why they were going up like the time during my first month at college when i was invited to a wiener roast wiener roast i discovered too late was coverup language for beerbust which was forbidden by school policy and which was really busted up by the police since then i have never had any inclination to go on a wiener roast even a bonafide one complexes again one day i couldnt restrain my curiosity any longer i dashed back to the dorm before lunch and stood nonchalantly at the bulletin board shortly afterward the parade started the first freshman classmate i saw i grabbed by the arm pulled her around the corner and whispered where is everyone going with nothing onexcept the bare essentials she looked at me and her glance implied amazement then answered in a matteroffact voice for a suntan of course the of course passed me by and i pushed the point why why she blurted as though i had asked a stupid question why because its spring and everyone wants a suntan as soon as possible in the spring oh i see was my brilliant response it was something i needed long hours to ponder and ponder i did it had never occurred to me that anyone who wasnt tan would want to be but then a permanent tan such as mine seemed to be a tan of a different color i knew from the experience of living in a state with sourthern could be that misspelling was a freudian slip sympathies that there was something undesirable about having a permanent tan perhaps it was the novelty of the thing you didnt fade in winter and have the opportunity to bemoan your fate in being so utterly and disgustingly colorless a few months of the year it gave you nothing to look forward to in the spring no long hours of broiling and roasting in the sun no classes to cut for the more important occupation of lying idle soaking up the sunshine and flunking classes yes i decided it was a dreary fate that had assigned me the status of being born with a perpetual tan i puzzled over the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune long into the summer the daily trek to the roof continued and everyone well everyone minus three in the dorm spent countless hours broiling scorching and smouldering beneath the sun i listened during many heartrending hours with what i hoped was a sympathetic ear to the laments and tearjerking tales of my classmates and dormitory neighbors there was many a day when i was ready to weep at the cruelty of nature some of the poor things just couldnt tan think of it they couldnt get any darker they made me feel guilty there i sat as brown as the proverbial berry and i had done nothing to enhance nature i was just born to negro parents and while that fact included certain builtin problems at least there was one problem i would never have to face neverthink of itnever would i taste the ecstasy of spending wasting countless hours sweating simmering and broiling beneath the feverish sun never the joy of rushing to the mirror to see if i was still raw medium or well done never the glance of envy from those poor unfortunates who couldnt tan as they watched me grow darker with each setting sun ah yes life does have its darker moments doesnt it well at any rate by the end of my freshman year some light had been thrown on the statement that up there you wont even know youre black there was one girl less inhibited than the others who used me as a gauge for her efforts at least once a week she bounced into my room grabbed my arm placed it next to hers and rejoiced at the ever diminishing difference the memory of that spring plus the annual antics of the sunworshipping multitude keeps me wondering i am anxious for the psychologists and sociologists to enlighten me i know it will take an explanation by one of these groups with words two inches long before im fully satisfied im sure it couldnt be anything as simple as the fact that a teasing tan is a mite pleasing to the eyes natural or otherwise but perhaps that thought is too absurd especially when one considers the great wall of discrimination built around those who are identifiable primarily because of dark skin color in such cases its a lifetime tan but so far as i have noticed it is not exactly a status symbol the red chinese in africa by brooks johnson year or so ago an american diplomatic delegation went to a new african nation to open the new american diplomatic mission the group was eight strong and headed by a negro upon arrival in africa they found they had been preceeded by a red chinese mission which was strong the red chinese govvernment had wisely recognized the new republic of guinea immediately upon its independence america had vacillated waited and lost valuable time and momentum to the red chinese did we expect that a negro and seven others could possibly offset the numerical and psychological gain that the red chinese already had other incidents of large chinese technical and advisory representations in africa have been reported these reports are doubly alarming when the implications involved are seen china with its own great internal development problems can ill afford to gamble with draining off this badly needed talent and sending it off to africa she can not unless she imagines that what she stands to gain from africa merits such a grave risk the game of power politics tells us that a gamble of this magnitude is not being taken for brotherly love what then in tangible and material values does africa have to offer red china it is felt by some that africa has the latent power to help solve many of chinas problems and to catapult china into the most powerful nation in the world one of the most pressing problems plaguing red china is her population in some fashion under some scheme it is a political and economic necessity that a sizeable number of her inhabitants must go lebensraum for the chinese can come from several places it can come from the area the russians took from them namely outer mongolia and sakhalin but this is highly unlikely the russians were not disposed to give them this land when relations between the two behemoths were warm it is not expected that the russians will be apt to show any great generosity now that the relationship has cooled another area which might help china ease her population problem is south east asia but here again the chinese may find they are somewhat stymied the new federation of malaysia is a direct britishmalayan defense against red chinas expansion in that direction malaya the worlds largest producer of rubber and tin is one third chinese the malayans are deathly afraid of the bulging industrious chinese population there singapore eighth largest harbor in the world serves as the port and is the lifeline of malaya although it is a political entity in itself it needs the trade that passes to and from malaya or it will become just another swamp as it was before the tin and rubber trade made it the pearl of asia singapore is overwhelmingly chinese there cannot be any effective federation of malaya and singapore alone that will not have a sizeable chinese majority the problem has been neatly solved by adding the other british protectorates of brunei sarawak and north borneo as members of the federation in doing this the british have assured that the nonchinese population as illiterate and in many cases lethargic as it is will at least have a solid majority in adding these last three british protectorates they have also included the oil rich reserves of brunei the effect of all this if successful will be to deny the chinese the opportunity of taking over in the prementioned areas it should also be noted that in some of these areas the chinese minority has been defranchised harried and even stripped of property holdings some nations have nonimmigration laws against the chinese if china fails in south east asia she will no doubt have to look farther afield for her badly needed lebensraum the fact that africa for centuries has been a catchbasin for some of europes population overflow has not escaped the keen eye of the chinese communists one of the biggest problems that china faces also coincides with that of over half of the people in the world today hunger china needs million tons of grain and rice a year to feed her people she is able to produce about million tons a few asian nations such as thailand have a surplus of rice to export most are like japan which has to import much of what she eats this reduces the amount available for red china because she has an unpopular credit system whereas nations such as japan pay cash this coupled with the overall fear many nations have of china causes her to lack a quarter of her needs even though she gets some grain from canada which in turn gets it from america it is very clear that mao tsetung does have a very pressing food problem the food problem of mao brings to mind the words of another dicta tor mussolini mussolini said give me ethiopia and i will feed europe no one gave ii duce ethiopia with the tacit permission of the league of nations he took it but he never got around to feeding europe however having seen the rich plains of ethiopia it is easy to understand why he was moved to say this ethiopia has a fine rich soil in many areas there is an ideal average temperature of degrees it is felt that in some areas crops can be harvested twice a year while in others it has been set at three times yearly ethiopia is not the only rich and arable land of africa but the very thought of such harvests must have set millions of hungry chinese mouths watering there are many other areas which could be made to produce enormous amounts of foodstuff with modem techniques and equipment any nation hoping to aspire to world prestige and power must have certain essential elements steel oil and technical skills are among the more basic prerequisites china is woefully deficient in the first two africa has the very rich mineral deposits south of the sahara and the oil of the libyan desert in all areas of subsaharan africa where minerals are to be found the chinese are not far away africa sorely needs to establish plants and facilities on her own soil to process her raw materials under the colonial system these treasures were taken to the colonizing nation processed and sold back to the african at inflated prices if processing is done in africa then africans will have more freedom and flexibility as to whom they can sell their products they will also be able to enter the international market on a fuller scale this the red chinese are working very hard to develop in the process of doing so they are not making themselves unpopular with the african economic developers the reason for the gamble china is taking in sending some of her crack technicians to africa becomes clearer when the potential of a combination between china and africa is seen both nations need and want more trade to reach their respective potential both are interested in seeing africa have more freedom regarding the disposal of her products africa needs technical aid which china has to a limited extent africa has large deposits of natural resources which china badly needs both want to see the disappearance of interference by western powers in this area it would appear that china would have an unlimited right of way directly into the economic capitals of africa but in her drive and designs on africa china has three major obstacles which frustrate her efforts they are the united stateswestern bloc influence and interests russian activity and programs and african nationalism the first two considerations are important at present but there is some reason to believe they might become less so as time passes my reason for saying this is based on the following observations as africa grows stronger she will in the words of julius nyerere president of tanganyika pick her own friends and we do not allow our friends to pick our enemies america has the greatest persuasive force of all as far as african friendship is concerned this force is million in numberand black africans having had in most cases experiences with colonial oppression are very much attracted by democratic ideals this is natural and follows the same desire pattern as the american revolutionaries held after their fight for independence the united states being a democracy the oldest functioning one in the world has some direct parallels and comparisons it could make between the new african nations and the united states in both cases the continents of africa and america had to throw off foreign domination and colonial exploitation ironically the stories are almost carbon copies of each other the propaganda potential of the parallel is almost limitless the major flaw in the beautiful comparisons however is the treatment of the american negro in the united states despite their preference for democracy how can it be rationally believed that black africans can trust a nation which treats its own black citizens so undemocratically to further compound the situation the cases of undemocratic treatment of black africans themselves in the united states occurs with devastating regularity much of the black distrust of the united states could be overcome if the u s would merely uphold the law and the spirit of the declaration of independence and the constitution these things white americans everywhere take for granted there are some sections of the united states where a negro takes his life in his hands when he attempts to get even the most minimal benefit from these documents the racial folly of the united states is not limited to its national boundaries our white diplomats take their stateside prejudices to their posts in africa we have a report of e frederick morrow first black man in the white house who said that he was told that the wife of a diplomat about to be stationed in africa had the audacity and poor taste to let it be known to negro newsmen that she and her diplomat husband were very disturbed at being stationed in africa she and her husband considered it an injustice a step down and an extreme hardship it is known in many areas that the american colony sits off by itself in these countries and there is only a minimum attempt at contact between the american personnel and the native population programs such as the peace corps and some genuinely inter ested diplomats have to be spared this accusation americans have not omitted africa north of the sahara either while in libya i met and talked with a group of libyan employees of american oil firms doing business in the rich libyan oil fields one of the men had been sent by an american firm to the united states to study a phase of petroleum technology at the university of oklahoma upon his return to libya he was given the post of timekeeper the person holding the position he had been trained for was an american and did not have a commensurate background the american although not as skilled was getting several times more pay and privileges americans were discriminating against this man in his own country there were other examples related to me it seemed that there was enough discontent among many of the trained workers for them to form an informal organization based on the discriminatory practices of american firms operating in libya their goal was to pressure aging king idris not to renew contracts of the various firms when their agreements expired here we have a case of americans blindly cutting their throats with a doubleedged knife in one instance they train and educate a man under their contract agreement then once he has been taught how to do an important and vital function he is discriminated against when men are hired to perform this function the result is a group of highly trained men skilled in the vital operation of oil production who are dissatisfied with american methods these men are now organizing to force the american interests out here we have american capital paying for their training and american prejudices causing agitation for american departure russia is not to be found sleeping in regard to the potential that africa offers her activity in the congo crisis brought this dramatically to light just as china is having trouble feeding her masses we have been reading of similar problems arising from crop failures in the ussr food is not the only resource that africa offers the oil minerals and general discontent of the people of africa are prime targets for communist designs in the area but the russian effort is thwarted in several ways like the americans they seem to be their own worst enemy we have read of african discontent at discriminatory practices in certain communist countries of the balkan sea area it is also known that the same practices and complaints have come from those who found themselves in schools in russia itself further the africans have looked with some concern on the ruthless russian suppression of the hungarian revolt for selfdetermination were the hungarians seeking anything more than the africans themselves want in africa itself the russians like the americans are running into a type of social suicide the russian technicians and advisors are very exacting and demanding in the standard of performance they expect on the technical projects they supervise they make no attempt to conceal their contempt for african workers who are not as adept as their advisors would have them be this of course is unfair to an african who is just beginning to learn the skill at which he is employed he reacts unfavorably to the russian conduct and opinion concerning him after all is the russian so unlike in mannerism and demeanor the european who formerly looked down his aquiline nose at him the african has labored against almost impossible odds to win independence in order to succeed in his desire for independence of the white mans rule the african has had to undergo great pressures and stress in order to accomplish this a strong will and faith was needed there had to be a focal point there had to be something around which he could attach his dreams this substance that he drew upon the thing that sustained him was an intense identification with his heritage his land and his color this has been called nationalism the more tyrannical the rule he had to overthrow the more intense the sense of nationalism became in many instances this nationalism was diverted to racial lines the whole problem was simplified for mass digestion and became black against white politicians today in many areas of africa find it impossible almost to win an election with pleas for moderation on the race question because there is such a strong feeling in many areas against whites from whatever country the chances of russian communism getting too strong a hold in africa are proportionately reduced by the same token the americans are not much better off this is especially so when the african hears of the discrimination practiced against black people in the united states the red chinese did not suffer as much from the color barrier as the other countries that are anxious to get a foothold in africa the chinese are not white and can more palatably speak in terms of their brotherhood with the african the biggest act of aggression of which the chinese have been guilty outside of their own borders is against the indians in many areas of africa however the indian is somewhat persona non grata this is because it was usually the indian who predominantly constituted the merchant class he was not exactly white and did not necessarily consider himself black like most businessmen he was reluctant to see the status quo upset and his proprietary interest put in doubt he naturally seemed to favor the colonial power even in cases where the colonial power refused to grant him full franchise in the civil_rights area this middleoftheroad feeling did not endear the indian to the african so the chinese do not have a race question or a hungary to mar their propaganda efforts the fact that both the african and chinese are colored does not seem to be sufficient to bridge the gap between the relationship that now exists between china and africa and what the chinese so fervantly want it to be china is daily growing further and further away from russia this not only involves ideological separation and alienation it necessarily involves economic and technical alienation also china is hard put to find other areas to fill the voids that the withdrawal of russian aid and cooperation will bring about the natural and most profitable place would be africa africa has a need for some of the things china can supply as limited as her technical resources may be china still has more than is now present in africa the chinese technicians unlike the russians and other advisors are more tolerant and patient with the apprentice african bonds of color tolerance and mutual need are being welded between the african and the chinese with western prejudice and ineptness serving as a catalyst the west with its arrogance and racial stupidity seems to be in no real position at present to stem or stop chinese progress in africa the soundest speculation as to what will prevent africa from becoming dominated by red china would center around africas intense desire to remain free of foreign domination it does not take a great deal of perception to see that a combination of china and africa is potentially one of the most formidable alliances conceivable one of the very real and potent advantages that china has is the solution to the south african and portuguese colonies in africa julius nyerere made it quite clear in a recent speech at the national press club in washington d c that african leaders consider it most urgent and necessary that africans in these areas gain their independence and control of their country when asked what the united states ought to do about the situation in the republic of south africa he said america ought to convince south africa that she america means to defend freedom wherever it is in danger with everyone present aware that the means of defending freedom in south africa is through the use of arms it was blatantly clear that he was calling for armed support from the united states in the struggle for the freedom of the black south african it was also very plain to all present that the united states europe or russia would not undertake such a drive there may have been some relief in the minds of some as they realized that the united states europe nor russia would hazard such a venture but there was also some dread on the faces of others who realized that china was not in all probability afraid to take such a risk south africa is the richest and most developed nation in africa it may very well prove someday to be the pivot point of all africa with its technical skill and advancement coupled with a black administration it would have to play a most dominant role in any united states of africa if western recalcitrance on the apartheid policy there provides for red china to send in liberation troops or in some other way gain a foothold there then china would have a valuable satellite from which to influence the policies of the remaining african nations not to mention the bolstering of her own economy even assuming that china is not able to gain any real control in south africa she still could derive a great deal of goodwill by having the courage to assist other african nations which feel it is imperative that action be taken in south africa of course the same goodwill would fall to any other nation forthright enough to assist actively in the south african crisis in the even of a limited nuclear war china is one of the few nations which could survive the population lost in a sense it would be a blessing for them in terms of area mass the two areas in question constitute a sizeable portion of the world in the event of a continued peace the alliance is still one of great power it becomes patently clear that if china is given unrestricted even limited but effective access to the resources of africa she will then emerge at the least as the third major power in this instance she will have to be considered in any plans to ensure the peace keeping her outside of the united nations will be impractical and impossible if we are to continue seeking world understanding and peace through this body it would appear than any sustained peace will have to resolve itself through the machination of some international body such as the un if china is allowed to draw upon the resources of africa there will naturally arise a system of interdependencies and common interests in world affairs much like that which now exists between countries of the western bloc with the new common interests and bond with africa and the added influence her power will be able to exert in asia we have an international organization with china at the fulcrum the afroasian bloc will have the majority of the votes in any such organization and will therefore be able to dominate it to some degree the men who most fear and abhor such a condition most are too deeply immersed in their own dumb arrogance and stupid prejudices really to do much about this it is they in their amazingly narrow and shallow perspective who feed gasoline to the flame of which we speak it would appear that the salvation of the westrn blocas the western bloc likes to picture itselfis no longer up to the western bloc it is now in the hands of the africans the salvation of the western bloc in its position of power and prestige lies with the very force which was employed to throw off the influence of this bloc in africa in one wordnationalism africans have had to fight too hard and too long to allow their prized possession to fall into the hands of another outside power the pressures and stresses hardships and pains which the western world placed upon them forced them into a type of national cohesiveness which all but reversed the trend and flow of history this spiritual substance is not easily dissipated it is not likely that the africans will give up their hardearned independence to any outside nation the scars are still too recent from the last such foreign influence it will be this fear and jealousy that will stop the red chinese short of their ultimate goal in the meantime we can no doubt depend upon some economic social and cultural intercourse between the two giants this will undoubtedly benefit both in some areas let us hope that as they prosper and gain material goods their interest will more equate and align itself with those of the western world ensuring that some degree of permanent and harmonious integration on an international scale will result the necessary negro by art buchwald er since civil_rights leaders have been protesting job discriminate ej tion and threatening to sr boycott any company that doesnt hire negroes the major corporations have been searching desperately to have at least one negro on the payroll in something more than a menial position for the first time the collegeeducated negro is being wooed by large companies who need him desperately to avoid a national boycott since most of the big companies have never hired negroes for executive positions before they really are at a loss as to how to go about it the search is going on very quietly and no one is willing to talk about it but the competition is getting so fierce that we wouldnt be surprised if it went something like this two vice presidents of the mackerel soda co are sent to interview thomas jefferson jones who holds a ba and an ma and a doctor of philosophy degree from mit before birmingham jones was working as stockroom clerk in a large new york department store but now everything has changed mr jones the first vice president says wed like you to join our company in an executive position if i understand you correctly jones says youd like me to be your executive negro no nothats not it at all the second vice president says weve been searching for some time for somebody with your qualifications to head up our interdepartmental bottling sales liaison what is that exactly its a new job which would require you to consult and report and make suggestions on managerial procedures that could improve consumer interest on a company level i see jones says but youd want me to sit near the door as a matter of fact we would but that has nothing to do with the job why do you ask the star rubber co offered me a similar position provided id sit near the door so anyone who came in could see they hired negroes but that isnt our main concern mr jones we are much more interested in getting the best team possible for the company im sure of that jones replies what would my title be we hadnt given it any thought the ezra light gas co offered to make me executive vice president in charge of broken meters we could make you vice president in charge of refunds on bottles that sounds pretty good jones says what does it pay twentyfive thousand dollars plus fringe benefits plus a house in an allwhite neighborhood and police protection for a week while you move in the wagon train food co offered fringe benefits and membership in their company country club well meet the offer one of the vice presidents says on the other hand jones says the frothy dairy co offered me a year and a stock option as well as a bonus and profitsharing plan all right well meet it just sign here i cant gentlemen jones says why not the department store where i used to work as a stockroom clerk has just made me chairman of the board what are you going to do for them one of the vice presidents asks sit near the door the soul of modern jazz by leroi jones think there are very few people who are r close to jazz who would dispute the fact that the three most important saxophonists in all jazz history up to now have been coleman hawkins lester young and charlie parker there have of course been other important jazz saxophonists but these three men have been more than just brilliant instrumentalists and gifted improvisors what is most important is that they were innovators and lasting influences on their contemporaries and every other jazz musician to come after them no matter what instrument they might play just as you once could find and can still find piano players or guitarists who patterned their styles on what louis armstrong did on trumpet so you can find diverse instrumentalists making curious or not so curious uses of what bean pres and bird have done charlie parkers influence is just as important to postbop piano players as it is to saxophonists even a musician as patently individual as vibist milt jackson must admit to being heavily influenced by the coleman hawkins attack there are guitar players and trombone players whose styles owe a great debt to lester youngs behindthebeat cool definition of jazz but as far as jazz saxophone the same time and still come up with something beautifully singular one thinks immediately of a tenor man like lucky thompson who seems to have understood both hawkins and young equally and to have arrived at an astonishingly original use of both those antithetical concepts of tenor saxophone playing gene ammons is another fine tenor player who puts both young and hawkins to work in his own playing and manages to emerge as a fascinating stylist charlie rouse yet another and of course there are many more the point is that for every paul quinichette say who was content to utilize merely lester youngs heavy influence or sonny stitt who could hear only parker or chu berry who was fastened to hawkins there were other players who were able to take some of the strongest qualities of two of the innovators or even all three after bebop and the emergence of charlie parker as the third giant of the jazz saxophone and fashion their own personal styles it is possible to trace the development and ascendancy of the saxophone in jazz by citing just what each of these three men contributed coleman hawkins is known by most jazz people as the man who invented the saxophone it was bean who first made the sax a respectable instrument as far as jazz musicians were concerned before his appearance the instrument was used largely for its novelty effect in dance bands and those hotel or theatre groups known as mickey mouse bands hawkins took the horn and inspired by louis armstrongs trumpet technique developed a huge tone and a smooth onthebeat approach to saxophone phrasing that brought the instrument into its own as a jazz solo voice and for a long time after hawkins almost anyone who played the instrument sounded like him there was just no other way lester pres young brought the tenor saxophone to perhaps an even more autonomous position as a solo instrument instead of emulating hawkins wide toned onthebeat eighth note approach pres inspired as he said by the cmelody saxophone of frank traumbauer brought a light flowing gauzy tone to the tenor he also liked to lag just a little behind the beat and accent this penchant by laying out or resting at them unusual places in a phrase and then swooping lazily but impeccably back into the phrase as if he had never stopped playing hawkins saxophone work as impressive as it was was really just an extension of the louis armstrong trumpet style to another instrument but young made for the first time a music that was strictly a saxophone music and his flexible almost uncanny rhythmic sense provided a model for many of the young musicians who came along in the s to produce the music called bebop since young jazz has become increasingly a saxophone music in the sense that the musics chief innovators since that time have been saxophonists from the earliest days of jazz the chief solo instrument had been the trumpet and trumpet players like the fabled buddy bolden freddy keppard king oliver and louis armstrong the musics most illustrious soloists but hawkins demonstrated how powerfully jazz could be played on a saxophone and young made the saxophone potentially the musics most expressive instrument alto saxophonist charlie parker was one of the two most exciting soloists jazz has seen so far the other of course being louis armstrong and as such he made jazz musicians even more saxophone conscious after parker trumpet players piano players guitar players bass players etc all tried to sound like him in much the same fashion as all kinds of instrumentalists had once tried to sound like armstrong parker made the conquest of the music by the saxophone which young had begun very nearly complete since young we have had roy eldridgc dizzy gillespie fats navarro miles davis clifford brown all as brilliant trumpet soloists but the chief innovators have been saxophonists and just as parker was the soul and fire of the bebop era in fact most jazz saxophonists are still heavily indebted to him it is still saxophonists who are the fiercest innovators in contemporary jazz right at this moment three of the most daring innovators in jazz are saxophone players and a curious coincidence is that like hawkins young and parker the proportion remains the same that is two tenor saxophonists and one alto player make up the triumvirate the tenor men are sonny rollins and john coltrane the alto player is ornette coleman the most controversial of the three of the three rollins has been on the jazz scene the longest having come up with the second generation of boppers rollins like everyone else of the period was deeply affected by charlie parkers music and his style on tenor has always shown parkers influence but by the mids rollins came into his own and began to play his own horn and since then he has become an extremely ubiquitous influence himself in fact rollins was perhaps the strongest voice of the recent hard bop trend it was a trend that was marked by a return by many jazz musicians to what they considered their roots as a reaction to the soft timbres and rigid arrangements of cool jazz saxophonists began to utilize wider and harsher tones of which sonnys was the widest and harshest and most expressive and accompanying piano chords became more basic and simplified often relying on a sort of gospel or churchy feeling to emphasize the afroamerican beginnings of the music this trend still persists in what is called soul music or funky jazz which is still enjoying a great deal of popularity but rollins has since gone on to deeper and even more expressive things albums like way out west freedom suite and saxophone colossus showed that sonny was interested in being more than fashionable and he still had more experimenting to do john coltrane after playing with various rhythm and blues groups and one of dizzy gillespies big bands late in the s began to be noticed in the middle s as a member of the miles davis quartet and quintet coltranes biggest influence for quite awhile was dexter gordon who also influenced rollins and was one of the earliest people to transfer parkers approach to the tenor saxophone coltrane was also struck quite a bit by rollins but by the time he finished playing with thelonius monks wild groups he was well on his way to becoming one of the most singular stylists in jazz the youngest of the three current saxophone innovators is alto man ornette coleman he is also the one whose innovations have been most challenged by many jazz critics and musicians whose short sightedness makes it difficult for them to accept the genuinely new just as young and parker were for a long time considered charlatans or merely inept except by a few musicians and critics who tried to understand what they were doing so young coleman has had a difficult time of it but he has been to my mind the most exciting and influential innovator in jazz since parker and even though coleman didnt arrive on the big time jazz scene until he has already managed to influence to quite an extent the other two major innovators rollins and coltrane not to mention the myriads of other younger players regardless of their instrument rollins and coltrane had mature styles before ornette coleman was known even to jazz insiders rolins huge tone which often sounded like coleman hawkins paraphrasing charlie parker and his ability to improvise logically and beautifully from thematic materials rather than chordal were the things that characterized his precoleman style coltranes sound was and is smaller and less rigid than rollins and because of its striking similarity to a human cry it can often raise the hairs on the back of your neck rollins seems always to address himself to any extemporization in the most formally logical manner while coltrane strings seemingly endless notes and scales together making what some critics called sheets of sound coltrane and coleman have almost diametrically opposing approaches to a jazz solo coltranes music takes its impetus and shape from the repeated chords that harmonically fix the tune in fact he plays sometimes as if he would like to take each note of a chord and sound it singly but at the same time as the overall chord it is like a painter who instead of painting a simple white paints all the elemental pigments that the white contains and at the same time as the white itself but ornette colemans music has been described as nonchordal that is he does not limit his line to notes that are specifically called for by the sounded chord the form of a coleman solo is usually determined by the total musical shape of what he is playing that is the melody timbre pitch and of course the rhythm all of these moved by ornettes singularly emotional approach to jazz in much the same way as the older primitive blues singers produced their music and this has been his largest influence on the two older men this freedom that coleman has insisted on in his playing has opened totally fresh areas of expression for coltrane and rollins as well but in the context of their own demandingly individual conceptions on rollins latest records such as our man in jazz victor lps and club dates or on coltranes recently recorded live impulse a or inperson solos the influence of this revived concept of free improvisation based finally on the oldest sense of form in afroamerican music the individual reaches its most impressive manifestation and of course ornette coleman himself on his records or in person continues to excite intrepid jazz listeners all over the country with the fierceness and originality of his imagination at this point in jazz the most imaginative voices continue to be saxophonists though the pianist cecil taylor has also to be cited in any list of recent innovators in jazz and it would seem that not only have rollins coltrane and coleman learned from the three original saxophone innovators hawkins young and parker but they also seem seriously intent on becoming innovators of the same stature it is certainly not a farfetched idea do by robert brackney eginning with mr pavlovs celebrated ca nine there has been sufficient number of experiments in producing neuroses in animals to establish a universality of behavior patterns of animals under artificial conditions and to outrage the aspca the reactions of a guinea pig for example to the repeated stimulus of electric shocks might include asociality loss of appetite or behavioral bizzarrerie in general in the animal homo sapiens negro genre however the reaction to the attention paid the group en masse has been the most curious form of introspection i am a homo sapiens caucasian genre an easterner by birth but a californian since i grew up in ivory suburbia and for many years my contacts with negroes were tenuous deprived of knowledge by lack of social contacts with negroes i found it easy to accept the conventional image of the negro the boy image the rhythmic relaxed obedient and perennially faithful servant a slightly benevolent variation of the white southerners good negro concept i also found it easy to sniggle at racial slurs and jokes purveyed by my contemporaries in my imagination as in theirs the negro albeit on american soil remained one with the jungle and his culture essentially african in those days my knowledge of african culture was even more negligible than my contacts with negroes living in a los angeles suburb until recently devoid of negro residents i tended to regard any negro es seen in the city as some sort of curiosity this continued until when my aboutface was accomplished in a most forceful manner in september of that year thenpresident eisenhower ordered federal troops to little rock to enforce desegregation i began to do some wondering who were these peo pie what could be so offensive about a people that they had to storm doors through which i could pass unnoticed i had not realized in my relative security that below me socioeconomically were people who strained against the iron chains of whitesmy peoplesignorance and who had to struggle to attain those things i took for granted aroused i began to read constantly on the matter of race i sampled james baldwins notes perused states rights literature and immersed myself in native son the result was an even more gripping obsession with race problems my interest in the matter redoubled finally when i decided i was old enough to go for myself i deliberately sought the negro neighborhood obtained quarters and with enormous selfconsciousness took up residence nothing happened i couldnt get over it it was all the same as it had been before the same play with a different cast i admit in retrospect that i had been brainwashed i had expected to find tribal customs and a backward way of life when i didnt i was frankly surprised my selfconsciousness subsided and i decided that as far as i was concerned it was all the same there was no need for scholarly theses exploring negro culture or comparing it to white culture no need for doctorates on inter or intraracial relations notes of a native son but was there as i became wellacquainted with the other tenants in the building a strange phenomenon began to unfold it seemed that the negro so long the object of white americas social microscope has been made so inescapably aware of race that he has begun to interpret the behavior for which his socioeconomic level environment or even his individuality is responsible in terms of race until i discussed this in earnest with a negro lady whom i liked and whose company i sought i had taken cum grano salis glancing references by negroes to racial behavior coming from a close friend and companion however from one who held as tenaciously to her own philosophy as many a southern white holds to his own it was upsetting economic practices alleged inter and intraracial relations even the matter of sexuality were ascribed to race we people soon became just as overworked and just as blanket a phrase as the one the white man uses the negro i cannot remember how many times i was told you just dont understand our people had i sampled only the icing on the cake where had been the truth in my youthful fantasies about the negro and the negro community the wrightinduced visions of endless rending of pornographic songs seminude figures sitting in littered airshafts of fivestory walkups where were the myriad vices of which negroes had been accused it had not taken long for my own experience to shatter the myths surrounding the negro and to establish that the only differences between the negro race and other races were epidermal yet in an instant i doubted all over again it seems likely that the negro does not call these alleged racial characteristics to his defense as scripturally as he would invoke the enviable accomplishments of such as ralph bunche and daniel hale williams to establish his capability and capacity for similar greatness rather it seems that through the intensity of attention focused on him and because of all that has been said and written of him by his own and by others he has actually come to take some of these things quite seriously the negro has been under the social microscope for so long and to the exclusion of practically all the other minorities on this continent that he has begun to take a peek for himself to find out what is so darn interesting about him there is little doubt that the information that is offered in this manner is an attempt at racial enlightenment an attempt to effect racial understanding but the constant drumming on we people instills white minds with one idea negroes are different and it is but a short step from different to unfit for firstclass citizenship or if you will social equality by unconsciously purveying suggestions of unbridgeable differences between the races and by unwittingly perpetuating in some instances the vicious sexual legend that has so long handicapped him and debarred him from his birthrights many a negro has been his own worst enemy it is a strange and sad truthbut many a negro fails to see himself as he would have others see him by falling for the cliches and nebulous stereotypes that spring automatically to many white minds he has actually placed roadblocks in his own path and is finding it harder to surmount them than it was to erect them by hoyt w fuller new world a coming could it be at long last that negro women are going to be permitted to come into their own as romantic heroines if the careers of two increasingly important young actresses can be used as weathervanes then such a climate seems at hand the two young women are cicely tyson and diana sands both enormously talented and on the rise in the uncertain world of show business now of course young negro actresses have achieved fame and fortune before and the names of lena horne and eartha kitt and dorothy dandridge come immediately to mind but there is an important difference misses horne and dandridge are negro beauties with features virtually indistinguishable from those of their caucasian fellowstars and miss kitt is all feline sex and grace properties both rare and raceless on the other hand misses tyson and sands are beauties in the negro mold the one satindark and smoldering the other highcheeked fulllipped

university where mr burns spent a year as harvard scholar in residence mr burns does a recap of american negro protest but puts far too much emphasis on the black muslim movement up from slavery doubleday the classic autobiography of booker t washington has a foreword by supreme court justice william o douglas in this edition the account of this great mans struggle against such formidable odds remains an inspiring saga and his achievements including the founding of tuskegee institute are undiminished decades after his death the legend of booker t washington however is likely to be eclipsed these days by that of his predecessor frederick douglass modern negroes view washington as an accommodator douglass as a militant many maintain that washingtons reputation grew at the behest of segregationists who saw in him a fitting idol for negroes since he advocated separate development and douglass was unacceptable both because he insisted upon an equal role for negroes and because he married a white woman it is interesting to note that even today the public assessment of the two men gives a considerable edge to washington although washingtons views would be rejected by most negroes today earlier this year doubleday also published douglass autobiography it was in paperback however one of the dolphin series the red china lobby fleet sets forth reasons why china should not

provides a sympathetic assessment of the arab viewpoint the book was sponsored by the council on foreign relations negro slavery in louisiana louisiana state university is an interesting wellresearched and generally objective book produced under the auspices of the louisiana historical association it is an account of slavery in the state and no attempt is made to discount the devices

thibodaux la and shed a by alice reid oung mrs lee pulled her rosecolored velvet morningrobe more regally about her as she stood she lifted her firm young chin up and away from the snowy froth of lace collar and swept out of the shining sunny breakfastroom her heart beat it knocked against her ribs her fine blue eyes were aglow with righteous wrath the newspaper she held was bunched and gathered in her fist and torn by her impotent anger she marched into her kitchen that was so yellow and fresh in the morning sunshine where light dancing along the chrome and porcelain surfaces sent silvery reflections to glimmer against the pale enameled ceiling peace and prosperity dwelt in the room the clean cabinets were neatly crowded with the finest condiments and all manner of delicacies and the aroma of the splendid breakfast still stood upon the warm air ennis bulked at the sink her aging hands deft among the rainbow soapsuds she was humming a minor tuneless upanddown melody that had no form it was strangely sweet her heavy gray oiled hair was done up in a tight neat bun and her large body was encased in an icewhite uniform that creaked when she moved so stiff it was with smooth oldfashioned handbeaten starch young mrs lee gathered together her breath and her courage she well knew that she was overstepping a most delicately balanced social boundary but she did not care she had to speak up this once or burst so filled was she with that noble emotion called moral indignation ennis she said ennis turned smiling her hands gone quiet in the warm water yesm young mrs lee held out the crumpled raddled paper ennis i wish to apologize to you for this atrocitythese atrocitiesi wish i could tell you just how really sorry i am about it about all of it ive been reading it herehow that school wont let that young man indid you see it of course you must have and ennis i think its dreadful all he wants to do is go to school what makes people so cruel its a terrible thing a perfectly terrible thing and im so sorry about it about everything and i do mean it so she gazed earnestly at ennis her azure eyes quite damp and she decided right then and there to give the maid an extra week off with pay in the summer perhaps it would help to offset the years of black pain black panic and black loss that she suddenly thought she understood all of mrs lees days had been spent in the midst of clean serene spaciousness she had never worked for money for the sake of her belly she had always possessed shining slippers for her little feet with new ones wrapped in tissue for sundays and special occasions she had forever owned her pinkish flesh her yellow hair and her blue eyesand her absolutely inalienable rights lately however she had found herself trying to dismiss the fact that something queer was going on out in the nonfashionable part of the world that just outside her white and exquisitely panelled front door there was great lamentation and an ominous rending of the very air sometimes she feebly discussed events with her husband and acquaintances but the conversations would always return to the old safe grooves such as the schoollunchprogram the latest dirty good bestseller and the doings of certain couples she saw ennis as an enormously capable shadowy extension of herself until this morning when she read the papers and looked at her servant she dazedly realized that ennis was a human that ennis had a life the maid did not vaporize at five oclock she went home to a ghetto she went home to crime and sex and dirt if ennis was disturbed by mrs lees awkward and extraordinary outburst she gave no sign of it she was used to masking her emotions in the presence of white people of exercising a certain amount of reserve but now she turned all the way around and looked at her mistress eyebrows high that boy aint had no busness goin down there and stirrin things up miz lee she said aint gonna make things no easier fo nobody but they want to kill him ennis if it hadnt been for those federal troops hed be dead them soljers aint gonna be round long then he wont neither mark me miz lee he shouldna never done it fus thing you know evbody be fightin and we gets long fine up here you jus got to tend t yo busness and pay yo bills and try t make it bes way y kin you do so have trouble here ennis i think hes truly trying to do something about it hes trying to end an old and terrible wrong cant you see how y gonna end trouble by makin trouble ennis asked by stirrin up riots and all we got t grow to it its gonna come but that boy caint cram hisself down nobodys throat an spect em t like it we gots t git it slow it got to be earned y like me t vite mself t yo nex pahty yes cried mrs lee extravagantly you are hereby now in vitedif it would make one particle of difference ennis chuckled and returned to her dishes mrs lees voice was tremulous doesnt he have the right to go to any school that he wants to attend she went to stand close to ennis to look into the dark tired handsome face dont you want your grandson to have a better life ennis rinsed a fork and thought what is wrong with this white woman aloud she said we gots good schools theys plenty schools he coulda gone to thout all this messmy granboy be all right his lifes bettern mine an my lifes easiern my mamas was those folks just outrageous they oughta rest in jesus why hes like jesus in a way ennis mrs lee replied tensely theyre killing him by inches did you see his face look at him she smoothed the wilted paper and looked again at the unsmiling haggard roundlipped face he can change the whole world she said after a time of silent contemplation and he has aged twenty years in a week how horrible it must be to be the target of all that hatred i wonder if it will affect him i wonder if it will inject him i wonder if you or i could have done this thing she continued to study the photograph with her curious interested pitying blue eyes ennis pushed eggshells carefully down the disposal shocked to hermarrow to compare that boy with jesus she offered up a tiny plea for forgiveness mrs lee glancing at ennis suddenly implacable face became aware of a feeling of chill she stood in her bright kitchen and wished that she had not spoken how much better it was to pretend that life was not uncomfortable her own little existence was a delight she owned long days all embellished with frantic rushes to the hairdresser to club meetings to seven pm dinnerparties it would take her three hours to dress when she had a date with her husband for showandsupperintown she spent her leisure hours sunning going to dressfittings and driving in to the elegant jewelry shop to have her pearls restrung mrs lee balled up the newssheet and thrust it into the handsome copper wastebasket perhaps youre right ennis she said i suppose that nothing so basic can ever be changed she longed to say more much more something anything to ask a thousand questions to find logical answers to pierce the natural reticence to understand but simplicity is dead and so she rearmored her heart her awakening heart and put back her reaching hand if you have a moment she said smoothly will you whip up one of your marvelous cakes were having casual company tonight all right ennis murmured she listened to mrs lees pretty mules go tapping away across hardwood floors and she thought what do you know about life livin on cream n peaches the way you do livin in a big house with all kind o help payin eighty dollars for dressfrocks takes me two hard weeks to get me eight o yo dollars grow up in a dirtfloor shack that sleep six on the floor that is life be made a kitchen and laundry slavey when you are seven and learn quickly to move faster than a fist can fly that is life learn intimately all manner of evil that is done by barbaric anglos and africans and think for years that it is the way that life is lived that is life know instinctively the sweet art of making a dollar and a lousy dime do the work of five that is life be matriarch over a clan of weak semijobless males who are always drifting away over the shrill conniving women over the struggling wrathful children who are veering away from all of the old beliefs they come to me they cry to me and im the one who must work and rule and wear this crown of thorns ennis deftly ran a damp mop over the shining floor she picked up the wastebasket put it down and fished out the crumpled newspaper she fitted together the tompieces and stared into the young mans resolute eyes can you make a better life fo my granboy she asked him silently so he wont get filled up wit pain and go out t steal an put lovebabies ill weep over in frowsyheaded women so he aint nevah gonna care bout standin round on corners in th sun at leven clock on a workday momin if you really be th start o sumthin better son why then ill walk wit you i is tired an th women like me are tired an its high time you menfolk gave us a han she began to stack away the pretty plates upstairs in her perfumed bath mrs lee let soapsuds gather in the soft water both of them were deep in painful thought relatively young mr lee was not a cruel man he gave lavishly to carefully chosen charities and he paid his taxes with a reasonably willing heart he had broken bread on numerous occasions with orientals and even jews and he often slipped extra dollar bills to ennis thin owleyed grandson when the boy came up on saturday to tidy up the patio however he did not at all share his wifes timidly liberal point of view during breakfast he had snapped the paper as he read the ugly news sneering at the chaotic photographs he had treated ennis with a civil contempt although he did manage to eat four of her delicious biscuits on the train that morning his annoyance was further fanned by conversations he held with his fellow commuters who also dimly viewed the notion of a black ape trying to force his way in where he definitely wasnt wanted they comforted themselves with piously regretful prophecies for they were not unkind men they honestly believed that a nigger should be content with what he possessed because at the most it was so much better than what he might be getting why he could be still dashing about in a jungle someplace mr lee forgot about the outside world when he entered his new office he loved his work he loved mastering the intricacies of engineering and special design and the look of crisp new artwork gave him great pleasure he liked the abstruse clipped language that so confused the layman he hung away his hat and tweed overcoat with one hand and reached for the overflowing in basket with the other the telephone rang almost immediately it was dave lane down in first in personnel dave had an engineer in hand he was sending him up to get squared away qualifications supremely superb lee lane chortled snapped im up names wheeler dont let im get outta the buildin great mr lee told him buy you lunch for that he hung up feeling fine now everything would go along smoothly again he hated it when the office routine was upset he told his secretary to send mr wheeler right in when that gentleman arrived the young man walked with confidence his lean face wore a most expressive noncommittal expression and he walked his full six feet no hunch no slouch on the heels of his dully shined black shoes he wore a neatly understated suit and his tie was impeccable he walked his full six feet down the long aisle that led to mr lees door and the people sitting at the desks looked up then looked again staring some of them narroweyed some of them looked at him with an interest that was not at all malign mr lees secretary smiled up at him im bill wheeler he said handing her a card yes she replied mr lane called us she buzzed her boss mr wheeler has arrived she cooed without further ado she rose and ushered mr wheeler into the inner office the white mans bluish eyes blazed suddenly he recovered in a twinkling and greeted the prospective employee pleasantly taking the cards and folder from his secretary with a small gracious smile sit down mr lee indicated a chair that was pulled up close to his desk billy wheeler is it thank you yes mr wheeler sat down he glanced unobtrusively about him as mr lee studied his papers the room was handsome he looked at mr lee middlingofage receding hair of good stock odorless a good tailor practiced bland eye the silence grew you have been busy mr lee said as he turned over a paper or two he looked up at bill wheeler smiling he leaned back in his comfortable chair and picked up a pencil we are at present engaged in a variety of programs mr wheeler all infinitely important we are concerned with design technological processes specification review we study the theory of estimation multivariate analysis decision theorywere a tight little group up here and we all work very hard do you think that you would be willing to work weekends and late at nighti know how you like your saturday nights ha ha as do we all he thought in fury what the devil does dave mean sending a dinge up here aloud he went on smiling ever work with principal scientists i was with a company that employed them mr wheeler answered showing his teeth also we got along famously uhhum mr lee tapped the folder once with his very sharp pencil you were in civil service he looked at wheeler yes bill wheeler said its all there in the resume sir but i wish to grow with a company well were considering everyone of course mr lee told him brightly pulling open a desk drawer and extracting a sheaf of papers i have several other applicants that id like to confer with ill call you mr lane the guy in personnel mr wheeler pointed to a card that mr lee had ignored im to receive instructions from you he hired me mr wheeler relaxed and took his gloves off im to start monday mr wheeler added mr lee felt the red blood swell his temples caution fled and the rage boiled over hed see lane about this later when he spoke though his voice was gentle he could have been speaking to a child why do you wish to work here we dont want any troublesome of our most capable employees might quit and the company couldnt afford that the position is exactly what ive been looking for bill wheeler told him im close to my home the salarys real good theres room for advancement and i want a job where i can work my mind to its capacity sir ive got a lot of good ideas but ive felt stifledid like to be more creative or somewhat creativeanyway this company has the tools that i need and ive got what the company wants he laughed a little i can even advise you on the transcient behavior of various types of stochastic processes mr lee smiled not he simply sat and looked at the man the man talked like a white man he vore clothes like one he exuded selfconfidence like a white man who knew his trade the nigger seemed completely unaware of the very evident fact that he was not a white man mr lee looked at the closed folder the references were marvelous the nigger qualified god damn it have you tried any other employers mr lee pleaded he simply had to try your companys equal opportunity i believe mr wheeler said coldly i wish to work here oh yes mr lee shifted in his chair i didnt mean to imply that we did not hire your group but i had talked to someone else and i have not yet had the opportunity to inform mr lane how can that be sir in an outfit the size of this one i know that the avenues of communcation are better arranged than that would mr lane hire him he would on my sayso mr lee working with absolute stats and mathematical procedures ought by now to have given you a horror of equivocation weve never had negroes here any ever apply none ever qualified i qualify there is more to the position than that mr wheeler there are the personal relationships we often have little gettogethers youd feel uncomfortable and so would the others for their freedom ofspeech would be somewhat curtailed you understand so many places do hire your group and ive noticed that they also form their own little cliques you wouldnt have a thing in common with anyone here and the company outingssome tactless remarkyou have probably experienced iti do want to see your kind get ahead mr wheeler but i simply do not think that you would fit in here mr wheeler grinned faintly im not intimidated mr lee i have used knowledge as a wedge to open many and many a door it is penetrating selfenriching and it works you dont have to like me personally sir when you give me an order close your eyes mr wheelers voice was quietthere was even a tiny ripple of laughter accompanying his last words the vast forces in that tastefully furnished room were leashed but the thread was thin i have become hopelessly assimilated into your world sir i worship your god i have educated myself i have learned to care for bach and picasso i am a student of euclid your culture such as it is is mine it is all ive ever known and what else could i have done if you will take your heel off my neck i will show you what i can accomplish you swarm all over everything mr lee cried losing control his soul in torment and blacken the world maybe we are smart mr wheeler mused thoughtlessly i think that is why you fear us so he looked into mr lees bluish eyes carlyle once asserted that mans business was not to see what lies ahead but to do what lies at hand we blacks are realizing that we are going to have to do what lies at hand because your tomorrow for us isnt ever gonna come bill wheeler leaned forward his dark eyes living wells of light why cant you see that it has to be we cannot regress sir my little boy is wholly americani didnt mean to say thatbut mr lee it isnt your world any more there are more like me coming and im afraid that you are simply gonna have to get used to the idea wheeler spread his hands and looked down at them there are more like me coming mr lees eyes remained fixed on bill wheelers face he was remembering a scrap of conversation that he had heard in a plush bar one night he remembered a man saying shortsighted ancestors left us with a problem now that the white mans burden is being shed whatre we gonna do for an encore and someone had said its inevitable isnt it and somebody else had spoken slowly viciously with quiet emphasis i think that well pull all civilization down around our ears first id light the first fuse gladly id set off a thousand hundredmegatons for i would rather die and rot unburied in the ruins of this earth than accept a negro as my equal mr lee stared at mr wheeler and he said to him do you think for one moment you shadow of a white man that i am going to help you take it away from me do you actually believe that i who waded hipdeep through blood and tears for centuries am going to stoop to give you a hand up do you really believe that i who perfected the arts of warring and living would willingly share the good of it all with you do you think that i want to share my verandah in the cool of evening with you in the cool of evening i want you there to bring my drink and fetch my slippers and i want to own the right to boot you off the place if i so desire and i will kill you to keep the privilege so said mr lee evenly and even gently in panic and out of a deeper emotion than even pain he added i have seen my women looking at you out of the corners of their eyes and there lay spoken the final truth mr wheeler looked at the pale implacable face he stood he held himself tightly for he wished to smash and destroy mr lee said into the silence i have hired an engineer i forgot to inform mr lane i am sorry we will of course keep your name on file the two of them regarded each other nakedly for a long and brittle moment after bill wheeler had gone away mr lee sat on trying to control the trembling of his hands and legs if we educate them and treat them as though they are as good as white men they will smear us from the earth with their vitalitythey are so alive he swung about in his comfortable chair and looked through the big window down into the busy street it was good out there good for a man a white man the plattersized steaks in the smoky darkpanelled restaurants where the help was black and devoured their meat in the kitchen the long blonde women who stalked upon slender legs costing a man plenty sometimes even a marriage the tall bright trim buildings that housed the technological machinery that white men had invented the sweet expensive resorts the mountain lodges the country clubs where the grass was so greenly groomed and where the sunlight sparkled on the turquoise water in the heated pools the skiing holes the money the fine old traditions the homes that were so big and lovely no god forbid oh blessed white god forbid it we can emphasize education mr lee thought maybe that will stop them maybe they wont be able to pursue us up this technological mountain if this wont work well then well just have to revert back to the stone age and declare war on them all all in that split second which followed his morbid cornered thought he realized dully and with a shrinking heart that they were going to have to yield the only alternative was violence and utter chaos the telephone jangled at his elbow startled he turned and looked at it grimly he turned about and yanked up the receiver epilogue bill said mr lee heres the info you wantedall herelisten you hear about the two new colored fellas they hired yesterday bill wheeler looked up in surprise no he replied smiling and accepting the datasheet thats swell well retorted mr lee sourly i just hope it works out i worked out murmured bill regarding his boss with his usual expression of gentle irony you growled mr lee you well hell youyoure different bill wheeler hunched over his work and mr lee stalked away grumbling happily to himself and after a little time one lone salted heartwrenched bitter wondering exasperated tear fell upon the pristine beauty of billy wheelers board a portfolio of african art text by denise paulme eneral awareness of negro art in all its forms music the plastic arts literature dates back to the years immediately following the first world war in london in paris jazz with its african ancestry conquered the musicians in may the devambez gallery organized in paris the first exhibition of african and oceanian sculpture in the editions de las sirene published the anthologie negre of blaise cendrars which brought together myths stories and proverbs of the african native in the same year the april issue no of the review action edited by florent fels presented views on negro art of wellknown artists and writers picasso juan gris jacques lipshitz cocteau andre salmon jean pellerinwhile from guillaume apollinaire who had died in november came an extract from the article in the mercure de france where in april he had devoted two pages to the fetichist sculpture of the black races these testimonies were not all eulogistic the dealer paul guillaume saw in african sculpture the quickening seed of the spiritual twentieth century but jean cocteau affirmed that the negro crisis in art has become as big a bore as mallarmes faponisme disparate views indeed but views from which one gleans the impression of a convergence between african plastic art and certain aspects of western art of that period in fact negro sculpture was first hailed as an art form by a group of painters living in paris at the beginning of this centuryvlaminck matisse and derain among others who frequented the galleries of the old trocadero while in london derain spent much time in the ethnographic department of the british museum in brussels a magnificent collection startingpoint of the museum of the belgian congo had been assembled for the exhibition and has been on public view ever since among these souvenirs de voyage these curios artists who would one day be described as fauves and cubists discovered a new art form whose echo seemed to respond to what they themselves struggled to express in the henri matisse collection included twenty or so negro statues derain braque and picasso were now the possessors of african masks at the same time a parallel movement began in germany in the painters kandinsky and franz marc issued their blue rider in munich here side by side with the works of picasso matisse cezanne gaugin appeared childrens sketches glasspaints medieval carvings chinese paintings etc evoked by gauguin the south seas was again represented by a statuette from easter island a mask from new caledonia also a woodcarving from the cameroons a plaque from benin and a mask from gaboon two years earlier in the berlin of there had appeared the black decameron of frobenius a miscellany of african myth and legend the work was quite beautifully written it not only commanded the respect of the specialist in negro art but also attracted the attention of people of culture throughout the west music plastic arts literature from onwards africa was no longer the forgotten continent its existence was recognized along with intimations of the riches it was to reveal the first volume of aesthetics devoted to african sculpture was the negerplastik of carl einstein published in einstein saw in negro statuary a profound and archetypal significance something worthy to inspire the modem artist overinfluenced by painting western sculpture had reached an impasse african sculpture according to einstein resolved the fundamental problem of the expression of volume of mass african sculpture alone in his view was true sculpture breaking with all academic formulas and reacting against the mannered impressionists which resulted in pictures where everything became dissolved in a cloud of coloured dust both fauves and cubists sensed the urge to forge a new style in search of signposts they turned towards negro art a term which for a long period embraced the divergent sculptures of africa and oceaniain much the same way that the impressionists before them had turned to the far east they in their turn sought above all else to find in the primitive arts arguments to justify their flight from convention negro art with its highlycommunicable sense of mass furnished the example of a tradition which its disciples claimed to be viable it offered too as bait the attraction of novelty it answered the taste for the exotic naive barbaric these adjectives exalted the souls of amateurs who cared little for the exact source of the work in question still less for its initial impulse and meaning in the hands of the artist it is due to the research of ethnographers well schooled in the art of their period that for the past twenty years african sculpture has been given a richer deeper signifi cance they have been able to assign each single work to the period and community which gave it life as well as explaining its function its method of usage and its symbolic values the importance of the religious factor in all aesthetic activity of the african cannot be exaggerated means and ends integral parts are all imbued by this consideration to set out to judge a mask or statue of the african continent purely on the aesthetic planewilfully ignoring the artists motive forceis not less absurd than to pretend to study medieval sculpture while disregarding christianity such ethnographical museums as house the most important collections of african and oceanic art strive nowadays to adapt themselves to this double necessity they would be failing in their function if they were not also museums of art their choicest specimensa benin ivory for example a baule mask a baluba caryatidare invariably isolated from the rest placed at an angle and in a light which seems best suited to reveal their form and balance although it may not be essential to understand its precise significance in order to appreciate the form which is given to a piece of sculpture it is not unimportant to realize that african masks with rare exceptions are a male prerogative from which women are kept rigidly excluded in a number of societies myth attributes the in vention of masks to a woman who steals the disguises abandoned by demons the menfolk then proceed to seize them regarding the masks the symbols of poweras the sole means of enabling them to exert over their wives the superiority essential to the maintenance of social order the variety which we observe in the masks is explained by their purpose the effect of terror will sometimes be secured by a stylization where human elements blend with zoomorphic ones eg monkey buffalo and antelopemasks sometimes by an exaggeration accompanied by a simplification of facial planes sometimes again by a juxtaposition of colours of symbolic significance adjacent to these terrifying exhibits there are others which aim solely to entertain and relax the viewer it so happens that these comic masks appear on the heels of their horrific neighbours providing a breathingspace which has been judged to be necessary but the uninitiated critic who is ignorant of this division will judge both the one and the other impartially as being either beautiful or monstrous one statuette may evoke the memory of an ancestor while its neighbours mission is to protect its master against everterrifying black magic always to be feared yet another is acting a role in a ceremony of divination the last may be a dollone of a pair of twins and during his lifetime the survivor will feed wash and dress the statuettean image of his dead brother it is all this that the museum strives to evoke with the exception of certain pieces which have been deliberately isolated the emphasis in each case is on the role played by the sculpture in the society in which it has its origins finally it would be absurd to suppose that all specimens are of equal value within a series originating from the same region the level appears to be more or less highthe masterpiece is always unique a single visit to a great museum is enough to show the differences which distinguish pieces from the same source or more or less derived from the same inspiration and obedient to the same stylistic exigencies w fagg who studied the present day yoruba sculptors in southern nigeria remarks on the aesthetic consciousness evinced as much by artisans as the patrons who order works from them a great sculptor can ask a higher price than the others and often gets commissions from distant towns and even regions where another style prevails recap on a dread disease by myron c golton young mothertobe a lay on her back at the cook county hospital in chicago the doctor could see she was doing poorly ive had chills for the past week doctor she said tonelessly with a seeming resignation to pain and suffering she coughed it was not a hard cough but the effect was apparent her hand went instinctively to her right side to cup the pain in her chest slowly she turned to spit out the white sticky mucous hows the baby going to come out all right a worrying fretful note appeared in her voice appears to be okay answered the doctor glad to be on a cheerful topic he was worried about the mother though her attacks of pains in the jointsthey were like rheumatic fever but were they something else was there in the background in her past medical history he was puzzled the picture was not complete it was like a cutout puzzle with pieces missing the offsounds when he tested her right chest could be pneumonia he made a written note of it there were other physical signs that bode no good yet her urine and blood hurriedly tested revealed little at halfpast ten in the morning she went into labor come on baby the world is waiting for you shell be proud of you be you boy orgirl what mother would not be chesty showing off her first child all this preliminary agony would be forgotten an hour later the poor little unborn parcel stopped sending out heart tone signals to the doctor tuning in with his shiny instrument no sense in telling the mother she was having a hard enough time of it she did not know soon enough better get on with the business and easy does it easy easy the way was not easy and the time was not short it was more hours long tossing straining crying hours before the baby was born for the baby it was late much too late for the mother it looked almost too late also she hung on desperately to that faint spark of life while they toiled around her trying to fan it to a blaze again six hours later the mother joined the baby when a postmortem examination was performed on the mother it was found that her red blood cells were long and whiplike in shape indicating that both she and her baby were victims of the dread disease sickle cell anemia the history of this case goes back years to the time when the mother was herself a tiny infant just letting out her first cry to the outside world if some medic had taken a drop of her blood that first day of her life and smeared it flat across a glass slide and peered at it magnified many times under a microscope he could have foreseen the tragic future but probably he too would have felt the helplessness of it for in those days sickle cell anemia was a medical territory virtually unexplored no one knew exactly what to do about it even today prospects are not too bright for this hereditary disease which is so peculiar to negroes and rarely ever found among whites as high as in every negroes examined have been found to have the oddly formed red blood cells which also take the shape of a crescent or a holly wreath sickle cell anemia was first detected years ago at a free dispensary on chicagos west side while dr james b herrick was examining a young west indian a medical student who complained of weakness and loss of weight even today the disease is occasionally referred to as herricks disease normal red blood cells when floating through the body are shaped somewhat like a cupped hand placed under a microscope they resemble a collection of nickels or a stack of poker chips viewed edgewise they are barshaped with a swelling at top and bottom researchers have found that the inner pressure of oxygen keeps the cells puffed up to their natural shape in fact it is this oxygen pressure that furnishes the key to the difference between a normal and a sickle cell reducing the pressure they have discovered transforms the cells from normal to sickle this is important but there is much more to solving the mystery of the strange behavior of the blood looking for more information researchers roland b scott robert p crawford and melvin jenkins all doctors at howard university examined hundreds of negro infants at freedmans hospital in washington d c they found that the blood of only per cent of the babies carried the ominous sickle cells when they examined older children however they found the percentage to be more than twice as high evidently the presence of these cells becomes more apparent or more numerous as the child grows older studying sickle cell traits among pregnant colored women doctors paul k switzer and heyward h fouche found that the disease usually appears before a woman is years old once started it never lets up in fact it continues to aggravate ruthlessly dogging its victim to an early grave women with the disease have less children and are more prone to abortions researchers who examined pregnant negro women at roper hospital in charleston south carolina found that one out of every seven possessed the sickle cells in their blood yet the study failed to disclose any ill effects three chicago doctors alfred j kobak philip j stein and august f daro considered the problem extremely grave during pregnancy they discovered many cases of the disease among negro women in the maternity wards at cook county hospital women who were thin and underdeveloped whose past medical history revealed frequent attacks of pneumonia and other respiratory infections who complained of joint and muscle and abdominal pains with nausea and vomiting usually were infected with sickle cell anemia many of the patients also suffered with leg ulcers and jaundice fellow doctors who practice in other hospitals and rarely come across the disease were advised to suspect it even though the symptoms indicated rheumatic fever tuberculosis syphilis or some other form of anemia when women infected with sickle cell anemia become pregnant they are fortunate if the baby is delivered successfully all too often it ends in abortion or stillbirth the doctor must watch the mothers health chart constantly when the deadly shock comes signaling a sudden interruption in the vital blood flow within the body the medic must work and think fast for he knows then that the oddshaped cells have formed clumps which have clogged up the liver and bottlenecked the normal flow of blood through arteries and veins this grave problem received special attention at cook county hospital choosing his words carefully obstetrician alfred j kobak said i do not believe the disease is necessarily increasing rather would say we see more of it because we look for it at cook county hospital when a negro patient shows clinical evidence of anemia special efforts are made to determine the presence of sickling in his red blood cells when asked if other cities were affected as much as chicago he answered that inasmuch as it was almost entirely a disease of the negro wherever a large segment of the population is nonwhite one can expect a comparable increase in the number of cases said dr kobak there is nothing in the diet of the negro which might encourage sickle cell anemia i have found it among the wealthy as well as the poor if you have the disease he warned see your doctor immediately lead a guarded life rest often make sure you have a high calorie diet together with plenty of vitamins and iron any time there are intercurrent infections such as colds see your doctor at once you are especially the kind of person who cannot take chances with any threat to your health for relief i recommend blood replacements and long periods of rest anything that tends to bolster up resistance is helpful medics have known for some time that sickle cell anemia is hereditary and not contagious but what is the latest information on the subject what is medical science doing about this dread disease in an effort to answer these questions i visited the worldfamous medical research institute of the michael reese hospital in chicago there i interviewed dr karl singer head of the department of hematologic research where studies go on constantly in efforts to crack all the recondite mysteries within that fluid we term blood dr singer told me that sickle cell anemia is by no means a rare disease in fact he said next to leukemia it is the most prominent blood disease at the michael reese clinic alone we have about cases under treatment all the time he estimated that there are negroes in the united states who carry the sickle cells in their bodies fortunately not all of these people become ill there are two classes those who have the sickle cell trait and those who have the disease the first group carries the sickle cells in its blood but does not seem to suffer any ill effects the second group carries the sickle cells and suffers from the disease too dr singer estimates that a total of to people in this country come under the latter classification it strikes both sexes alike in the laboratories of the research institute after years of trial they have finally evolved a simple test to detect the presence of the peculiar shaped cells mixing a drop of blood with a drop of a certain chemical on a glass slide they wait a short time and then look through the microscope in from five to minutes sickle cellsif present will appear what chance does a baby have of inheriting the disease if both parents are affected said dr singer there is a per cent chance of each of their children being affected also what of the future dr singer drew some interesting and startling conclusions medical science has made great strides since sickle cell anemia was pointed out by dr herrick in now a patient has a much greater chance of weathering the storms of the disease doctors are aware of the problem and medicines and knowledge are abundant crises can be anticipated and patients protected from dangerous infections men and women with sickle cell anemia formerly were forced out of the normal streams of life by their ill health their life span was short they naturally were not desirable marriage mates and so did not bear as many children as did normal healthy people women with the disease when they did have pregnancies had far less live babies than normal mothers the tendency then was for sickle cell anemia to disappear although the process was slow now however the picture is reversed doctors with antibiotics and modern knowledge of diets and general care enable these patients to live more nearly normal lives they will be living longer more of them will be marrying more of their babies will be born alive these things are all to the good but the link of heredity is an iron one whose secrets are still mostly mysteries to science sickle cells will be passed on to more and more children who will in turn grow up in increasing numbers to propagate more children it is a great public health problem it threatens to be greater in recognition of their important work and to further their studies the public health service awarded the medics at michael reese hospital a huge grant of money to finance continuing vital blood research at that institution there is a special laboratory for research in blood diseases where they are now intensifying studies in leukemia and sickle cell anemia it is hoped says dr singer that by studying these blood diseases general knowledge will accumulate which may aid in the study of many other related diseases the boys and girls of snick by howard zinn aving just spent a little time in greenwood miss i felt a c certain air of unreality a out the march on washington the grandiose speeches the array of movie stars the big names dropped and bounced several times the sheer impress of numbersall added up technically to an occasion that one describes as thrilling and it must have been so to participants and to the millions who watched on television still while swept up in the spirit myself i wondered if to the negro citizen of greenwood itta bena and ruleville of albany americus and dawson of selma gadsden and birmingham of danville and other places it may not have seemed the most gargantuan and best organized of irrelevancies there was one relevant moment in the days events at washington that was when the youngest speaker on the platform john lewis chairman of the student nonviolent coordinating committee lashed out in anger not only at the dixiecrats but at the kennedy administration which had been successful up to that moment in directing the indignation of people at everyone but itself the depth of lewis feeling and the direction of his attack may have baffled northern liberals mollified recently by the administrations new civil_rights bill by its bold words and by the presidents endorsement of the great march but john lewis knew because the young sncc workers in his organization are on the front lines of the conflict that while the president and the attorney general speak loud in washington their voices are scarcely whispers in the towns and the hamlets of the black belt greenwood miss just before the march revealed in its own quiet way how the deep south remains essentially untouched by resonant speeches in the national capital surrounded by cotton plantations greenwood overlooks the delta from a vantage point in westcentral mississippi it is the headquarters for the voter registration project in which all the major civilrights organizations cooperate and whose working force is supplied mainly by the youngsters of the student nonviolent coordinating committee snccaffectionately called snick it is the seat of leflore county where negroes are per cent of the population and half the negro families have an income less than a week almost no negroes vote and attempts of the past year to register negroes have been met with torch shotgun and a dozen varieties of official brutality intimidation and subterfuge the snick office in greenwood is like a front company headquarters during wartime as i came in one evening last august having driven from memphis i was greeted by annelle ponder whose younger sister i taught at spelman college in atlanta and whose path has crossed mine several times in the last few hectic years the ponder girls are all tall blackskinned and beautiful annelle has been in greenwood this past year handling the southern christian leadership conferences part of the voter registration project she is quiet and courageous she has been beaten by police in winona miss when friends went to the jail one day they found her sitting there her face swollen and marked barely able to speak she looked up at them and just managed to whisper one word freedom with annelle at headquarters were a bunch of the snick kids one of them came forward to shake hands and we recognized each otherit was stokely carmichael a tall slender philosophy student at howard university born in the west indies and reared in the sitin movement we had met in albany ga during the first outburst of trouble there in december i what was on for the evening a mass meeting at one of the negro churches and then a party at the home of one of the girls they showed my wife and me around the building on the first floor a big jumbled room for meetings with a long table in the center this was the dining room too for whatever voter registration workers were around when mealtime cameand a small kitchen to the side where mrs johnson cooked the meals upstairs were cubicles serving as offices and a large area with two iron cots in a corner for travelers in the movement cartons of books were on the floor they had been donated by a northern college and were soon to go on new pine bookshelves at the church meeting middleaged negroes who had lived forty and fifty years in the delta without shaking a white persons hand came up to shake hands and say hello greenwood has this past year been going through that tense hopeful process begun recently in many communities of the deep souththe first contact on an equal basis with white people an awakening to the possibility of genuine brotherhood these first white friends have been college students from new england or ministers from the middle west or just interested people passing throughrather than local whites but it is a start and among the snick youngsters manning battle posts in the black belt have been young white southerners bob zellner from alabama sandra hayden from texas it is a beginning and credit belongs mostly to the student nonviolent coordinating committee for blasting open in various parts of the deep south the first pockets of equal interracial contact for southern whites watching at the edge of these pockets it is a painful but inexorable educational process the first reactions to the sight of negroes and whites in friendly contact are outrage fury often violence but repetition of the vision dulls the reflex and there begins not acceptance yet but at least hesitancy perhaps greenwood police this past year have begun to move into the second stage when a police car stopped my wife and me as we were driving away from the snick party they seemed at least a little accustomed to the idea they flashed their lights again and again into our faces and into the car and cast looks at the house where the lights were on and the noise of the party could still be heard they spent some time examining identification papers and then unlike a previous similar experience in atlanta where my companion was a negro and we were arrested muttered for us to move on the next afternoon a race against time began among the snick workers in the greenwood office thirteen youngsters were in parchman state prison farm and had been there for two months fortyfive other negroesmen and women of all ageshad been on the county prison farm also for two months all of them had been arrested in june on charges of breach of the peace after much legal delay release was at hand a young lawyer representing the national council of churches had come to greenwood with bond money for these fiftyeight people but it turned out that information supplied him by local officials and transcribed on the bonds was full of errors and the county attorney would not accept the bonds if the transaction could not be completed by that friday afternoon the prisoners would have to spend another weekend in jail the proper information was quickly compiled and all available typewriters and people who could type were assembled in the voter registration project office the new data were typed in the papers were taken to the sheriff just before dusk on friday the fiftyeight emerged the headquarters that night had the eerie quality of a field hospital after a battle youngsters out of jailsixteen and seventeen years oldwere sprawled here and there two of them lay on the narrow cots upstairs where a few of the snick girls dabbed their eyes with boric acid solutions some dietary deficiency in jail had affected their eyes one boy nursed an infected hand another boys foot was swollen he had started to lose feeling in it while in the hot box at parchman and had stamped on it desperately again and again to restore circulation medical attention was refused them in prison the cold newspaper reports of the past few years about people arrested in various parts of the deep south for demonstrating have never conveyed the reality of a black belt jail three snick youngsters with a tape recorder on the brokendown table near us told about their arrest and about life at parchman the first was willie rogers it was twenty minutes to one when the chief came out of his car and across the street in front of the courthouse it was june thtuesday the chief said lm askin youall to move on we said that we were up there to get our folks registered so he said im askin youall to move on youre crowdin the sidewalkthe sidewalk was clear we walked up to the courthouse steps so as not to block the sidewalk he said im askin you to leave now we said we came to get them registered and soon as they registered we would leave so he started placing us under arrest one by one we stayed in jail about two hours before trial came off and the judge sentenced us to four months and fine for refusing to move on and about an hour later they came and took us to the penal farm which we stayed out on the penal farm about a week and worked tuesday without us knowin they had sentenced us to mississippi state penitentiary parchman mississippi two boys named john hanley and arthur jackson and ihe put us in the hot box we stayed in the hot box two nights its about five foot nine inches square which they call it the hot box long as they dont turn the heat onwith three in thereyou can make it theres no openings for light or air there was a little crack under the door but you couldnt see your hand before your face less you get down on your knees when you got ready to feed you they hand the tray through a little door which they closeand then you cant eat unless you get down on your knees by the light cornin in the doorthen you can see how to eat and they had a little round hole in the floor which was a commodeabout as big around as a sixpound bucket top after we stayed in there these two nights the sergeant started pickin at me youre the lyingest nigger in greenwood arent you i told him no i didnt lie which i had because i didnt tell him nothing about the movement in greenwood the last night he decided to take our tshirts and thingsso we decided not to wear no underwear so he decided to open all the windows and turn on the fans and the beds that we were sleepin on they didnt have no tick or nothing just metal and had round holes in it so last night i didnt sleepi stayed up all night and all day today and he came in right after lunch and macarthur cotton and i we werent saying anything and the guards came around and handcuffed us to the bar im seventeen my name is jesse james glover i live in itta bena mississippi i was arrested at the courthouse in greenwoodcharged for likewise not movin on some of the older people with us they moved on but we didnt think it expedient to move because the courthouse is a public place so we stayed we had a trial next morning we didnt have a lawyer we stayed at the county farm four days we dug ditches in the white part of town we decided among ourselves we werent going to work or eat any more because we were afraid of being shot from a car passing the road or by one of the guards because we were all working with snick we didnt eat for two days neither worked then they came to take us to parchman there was about policemen outside with guns and blackjacks and things standing around the bus when we came outwe all put our hands behind our heads and they searched us all put us on the bus so we left we stayed there a week and then i took sick he didnt let me see a doctor thats the man in charge they call him sergeant we ate twice a day at night they put the fan on and it was cold we were sleepin on a steel bunk with fortyfour holes in it a week later i was put in a place called the hot box i stayed in this hot box two days and a half i was put in because freddie harris and lawrence guyot and i was whisperin to each other another week i was put in the hot box again i stayed there four days about half a week later he said some lice had gotten in the place so he cut all our hair and gave us some blue ointment and put fourteen of us in a celltwo beds for fourteen of us we stayed there all night about another week i got put into this hot box againhe said we were talkin he put nine of us in this boxits about six by six nine of uswe couldnt lie down three or four more days they began to take our tshirts and cut our food in halfso we gave our shorts back because we said what good are shorts without tshirts so they put us back in the cell without our shorts and turned on the fan again we were naked it was real cold the next day he put thirteen of us in the hole this six by six hole we were making it okay about minutes with the fan offbreathing in this oxygen lettin out this carbon dioxideand the air was evaporating on top of the building and it got so hot the water was falling off the top of the building all around the sides like it was raining one boy was taken sick in the box they took the sick boy outthey didnt take him to a doctorthey put him in a cell for that morning he let us out of the hot box that morning back in the cell we told everyone to keep quiet because we didnt want to get in the hot box againit might cause a death in the hot box so we all were quiet for a long time then a few fellows were talking to each other he came down and told lawrence guyot im going to put these niggers up to this damn bar if i hear any of this racketso they hung macarthur cotton arthur jackson and willie rogers on the barsmacarthur was singin some freedom songs altogether i was thirteen days in the hot box how did i get in the movement i was at a mass meeting in itta bena id been walkin and canvassin on my own bob moses asked me did i want to work with snick i told him

movement i told him yes id be glad to help and i started from there on at first my mother didnt want me to be in it then she realized it would be best for her and for me if i were in the movement so she told me i could go ahead and work in the movement while the returned prisoners took turns lying on the bunks snick workers were being delivered to different parts of the negro section of greenwood to announce a mass meeting that night to welcome the prisoners back home you find roughly three kinds of snick workers in a place like greenwood two or three regular staff members who make or a weekin those weeks when there is money ten to fifteen students from various parts of the country who have left school temporarily to work with snick and who subsist on or perhaps every other week indeterminate numbers of young people from the town and the surrounding countryside who volunteer their time risk their lives and their liberty and get an occasional meal at headquarters i sat in on the staff meeting next morning held in the large main room in one corner was a boiler in another a rubbish can on the walls were a map of the city of greenwood newspaper clippings on civil_rights photos of pete seeger when he was in greenwood photos of jim forman executive secretary of snick scattered around were two typewriters some broken chairs books and newspapers and a big pot for koolaid but if poverty showed in the material possessions at snick headquarters the human resources were something else chairing the meeting was bob moses the quiet fighter in charge of the voter registration project a veteran by now of mississippi violence and nonviolence here was sam block silent thin dark his home deep in the delta who did the early reconnaissance for snick in the area and almost lost his life for it here was willie peacock also from mississippi another snick veteran annelle ponder was here representing sclc martin_luther_kings group martha prescod a slender college student from the north stokely carmichael the fiery young man from howard jean wheeler a smiling coed also from howard here too was a former star student of mine at spelman collegeher home a little town in south carolinanow just graduated from yale law school marian wright with her was another graduate from yale a young white fellow named oscar chase chase recently wrote a valuable legal paper which shows how the federal government by bold imaginative use of the injunction could fulfill its responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of negroes in the deep south in the room also was another of the increasing number of white college students in this essentially negroled movementa california sociology major named mike miller who has done impressive research on civilrights matters and five of the youngsters just out of parchman jail were present that afternoon we drove in two cars to itta bena a feudal cotton village outside greenwood where negroes came off the land to meet in a dilapidated little church welcome back the parchman prisoners and sing freedom songs with an overpowering spirit one of the returned prisoners was mother perkins fragile and small seventyfive years old who had just spent like the rest two months on the county prison farm for wanting to register cars filled with white men rumbled by along the road that passed by the church door but the meeting and the singing went on anyone who felt the urge got up and spoke an old man rose on his cane and said all these years going along behind my plow i thought some day things would change but i never dreamed id see it now bob moses told them that negroesand whiteswere without jobs in all the big cities of the nation that they could not run away any more from the delta to chicago and detroit that they must stay and wrench from the state of mississippi what they deserved as human beings marian wright told them a fable about an eagle that for a long time was told it was a chicken and believed it stokely carmichael reminded them that while the lord might be on their side they would have to secure their rights by their own intense efforts meanwhile the automobiles kept passing on the road outside the crushing conclusion that comes out of greenwood miss and selma ala and danville va and americus gais that the federal government is but a shadow in the hardrock places of the deep south standing at the foot of the lincoln memorial john lewis turned his wrath not at the easy target the dixiecrats but against the administration it is the federal government that indicted nine of our people in albany the democratic party lewis made clear cannot be treated as a savior as long as it lives with eastland nor can the republicans harboring goldwater what political leader can stand up and say his party is the party of freedom and then the most dangerous question one can ask in a country boasting of its twoparty system where is our party to many the march had been presented as a gigantic lobby for the administrations civil_rights bill but lewis pointed quickly unerringly to the weaknesses in the bill furthermore by sponsoring a new civilrights bill the administration had skillfully turned attention to congress and deflected the erratic spotlight of the civilrights movement from possibly focusing on inadequacies of the executive the straight crass fact at which john lewis was aiming is this the national government without any new legislation has the power to protect negro voters and demonstrators from policemens clubs hoses and jailsand it has not used that power despite the welcome new words of concern by the kennedy administration despite several dozen suits filed by the justice department in voting cases the negro in the deep south still stands alone and unprotected as he tries to eat in a bus terminal register to vote or hand out a leaflet on a street corner the right to vote and freedom of expression are not in themselves solutions to the fundamental problem which is a rearranging of economic and political power in the south but they are prerequisites to that rearrangement there is a constitutional rock to which the executive branch can tie its lines and then smash with all the pover at its command every wallace every barnett every chief pritchett every commander lingo every bull connor who ever begins to lift a billy club at an american citizen exercising his constitutional rights that is the supreme courts statement in the debs case of the entire strength of the nation may be used to enforce in any part of the land the full and free exercise of all national powers and the security of all rights entrusted by the constitution to its care but to act on that dictum calls for certain traits which the administration has thus far not shown imaginativeness in the use of the courts boldness in the exercise of executive power the courage to set new precedents in federal relations the willingness to bypass congress on an issue about which congress spoke its mind in when it passed the fourteenth amendment above all it means changing to the offensive up to now the administration has simply reacted to every racial crisis southern officials have thrown thousands of people into jail and then put the burden on the civilrights movement to get them out the national government needs to act and then put the burden on southern segregationists to revoke the action let them wrestle with courts raise money for trial plead for toleration the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment the supreme courts statement in the debs case the declaration of section of the us penal code that any official who deprives a person of his constitutional rights has committed a federal crime these are the alreadyexisting legal bases for executive action that action requires first stationing all over the south hundreds of federal agents replacing the fbi which is incompetent in the field of civil_rights to protect the constitutional rights of negroes these agents would have the specific assignment and the authority granted by the president to jail any local official who violates the constitution at the same time the president must begin fillingas he has failed to do so farthe federal judgeships of the deep south with persons committed to the principle of equality regardless of the wishes of the regions senators among the outworn political institutions of this nation is that of senatorial courtesy which requires kennedy to consult eastland in the appointment of a federal judge in mississippi talmadge and russell in georgia the shattering of precedent can start here then a combination of quickacting federal agents and determined judges can begin to rivet into the mind of the deep south and into the mind of the nation not that negroes are equal that will take time but that if they are not treated equally the consequences will be swift and harsh when ten core and sncc people white and negro walked into alabama to try to establish what bill moore at the cost of his life had failed to establishthe right to walk safely on a public highwaya cordon of federal marshals should have surrounded them and when alabama safety director a lingo showed up with his electric prod poles and guns he should have been taken immediately into federal custody the burden of legal proof needs to be borne by the segregationists and this has not yet been done any good lawyer knows that the advantage is in the hands of the man who moves first that delay and bureaucracy and legal complications all work against those who are trying to undo an action yet the civilrights movement which cannot help it and the justice department which can have been on the defensive the needed initiative is not likely to come from a government whose dedication to racial equality is as circumspect as that of the kennedy brothers it took a series of explosive crises throughout the nation to force from them words of moral concern that became part of the constitution a hundred years ago it took something close to a revolution to bring forth a moderate civilrights bill which will be further moderated by congress and by segregationists federal judges and by a cautious justice department basic changes are needed in the social structure of the nation before meaningful racial equality can be established but in the deep south a prerequisite for such changes is the establishment of the right to vote to organize to speak write and assemble freely and without fear of violence that requires a radical new use of initiative and power by the national government and because the administration and inherently any administration lacks the internal motivation for such a seizure of initiative it will have to be prodded by the increased use of nonviolent direct action right now those who see this most clearly feel it most intensely and are best prepared to move on it are the young people in the student nonviolent coordinating committee a centennial evaluation by rayford w logan he evaluation of the promise of emancipation like that of other promissory notes must calculate the intent of the signer the consideration expected of or given by the promisees the face and hidden values the added dividends and finally the payments by the promisees and the balance due them the most important controversy concerning lincolns intent in emancipating the slaves stems from his answer to an editorial by horace greeley in the new york tribune august greeley had chided the president for his alleged failure fully to execute the terms of the second confiscation act june which declared that the slaves of any person convicted of treason should go free on august lincoln wrote to greeley i would save the union i would save it the shortest way under the constitution the sooner the national authority can be restored the nearer the union will be the union it was if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time save slavery i do not agree with them if there be those who would not save the union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery i do not agree with them my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save this union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union i shall do less whenever i shall believe what i am doing hurts the cause and i shall do more whenever i shall believe doing more will help the cause i shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and i shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views i have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty and i intend no modification of my oftexpressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free those who gleefully quote this negro digest december letter in their efforts to prove that lincoln did not at that time plan to square his personal wish with his official duty overlook convincing evidence that he had already resolved in his own mind this dilemma early in july lincoln had already begun to compose the first draft of an emancipation proclamation on july he made known to two members of his cabinet his intention to prepare the draft on july almost a month before greeleys editorial the president submitted to his cabinet a tentative draft of an emancipation proclamation lincoln wisely delayed publication of this preliminary emancipation proclamation until a union victory would discredit partially at least those who asserted that the abolition of slavery in the rebel states was dictated by the need to enlist the former slaves against their former masters the union forces achieved a sufficient victory on september at antietam sharpsburg md and compelled the confederates to retreat across the potomac five days later lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation it stated that on january all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the united states shall be then thenceforward and forever free since the southern states rejected this olive branch of september lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation on january the proclamation made two promises first that the slaves in the states and parts of states in rebellion against the united states should be then thenceforward and forever free second that former slaves would be used as garrison troops and on naval vessels against their former masters and thus would have the right and responsibility to fight for their own freedom in the legal sense this military service was not a consideration not a quid pro quo for emancipation lincoln did not require nor had the slaves offered this service in return for emancipation but free negroes not only leaders like frederick douglass but also the rank and file interpreted it as a consideration they had previously encountered inertia legal and political obstacles and evasion when they had sought to enlist after january they so insistently demanded the right to fight for freedom that less than four weeks after the proclamation secretary of war stanton authorized governor john a andrew of massachusetts to enlist negro volunteers these northern negroes were fighting not only for the physical emancipation of slaves in the south they were fighting for their own freedom which an ultimate confederate victorystill not impossible at the beginning of would have jeopardized negroes thus interpreted the emancipation proclamation as a right and responsibility to share with other americans in the quest for freedom this was not a new interpretation negroes had helped to preserve the freedom of colonists from attacks by indians and frenchmen crispus attucks had been the first to fall in the socalled boston massacre despite initial opposition free and slave negroes had fought and died in the battles of the revolutionary war from bunker hill to yorktown negro sailors under perry at putinbay and soldiers in jacksons army at new orleans had contributed to victory in the second war for independence the war of a small number had helped to liberate from mexican rule california and the territories of new mexico and utah the acquisition of which had precipitated the renewal of the issue of slavery or freedom in all the territories the emancipation proclamation therefore gave negroes a right and responsibility to do for themselves what they had long done for others other values than this right and responsibility were less evident on january one was the promise of freedom to negroes in haiti and liberia from ostracism by the family of nations though this promise was hidden i believe that there was a clear reciprocal relationship between the emancipation of american negro slaves and lincolns recognition of haiti and liberia let us return to the crucial year on june congress passed a law abolishing slavery in all the other territories when lincoln signed this bill he had achieved a goal the pursuit of which at one time had threatened to destroy his political career abolition of slavery in the territories had constituted one of the main themes of his house divided speech at springfield illinois june the month of june witnessed another triumph for lincoln on june he signed the bill for the appointment of the first diplomatic representative of the united states to haiti to be sure this victory over the slaveholders and their northern allies had not tormented lincoln during his lonely watches at night as excruciatingly as had the question of slavery in the territories but opposition to the recognition of haiti had antedated opposition to the suppression of the african slave trade and the most bitter debates over the right of congress to abolish slavery in the territories since emancipation in the border states emancipation in the district of columbia the acknowledgment of the independence of haiti and liberiaand i would add the treaty for the suppression of the african slave trade as well as the law abolishing slavery in all the territoriesindicated lincolns purpose to carry forward in sumners words the principles of the declaration of independence the emancipation proclamation gave further evidence of this purpose one of the greatest constitutional lawyers from john marshall to john marshall harlan the farseeing nineteenthcentury dissenter lincoln realized that the legality of the emancipation proclamation would be challenged he therefore prodded the republican national convention of and congress until the latter voted in to send to the states a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery throughout the united states the job was of course not ended even after the ratification of the thirteenth amendment the southern states adopted new black codes designed to circumvent the amendment none of them gave the freedmen the right to vote the restoration of white control in the south after led douglass to remark in that he had long regarded the elective franchise as the one great power by which all other civil_rights are obtained douglasss initial fears were so compounded that by the time of his death in the promise of emancipation seemed almost an empty dream the ratification of the fourteenth amendment of the fifteenth amendment and the passage of the civil_rights act temporarily revived hopes of cynical and sanguine observers but the civil_rights decision which limited the application of the fourteenth amendment to states disillusioned them negroes suffered another cruel blow in december on the twentysecond henry w grady delivered at delmonicos in new york city his famous oration the new south flagrantly distorting conditions in the former confederate states he gave the assurance that the south could be depended up to treat the negro equitably his audience of some of the most prominent and powerful northern business men magazine and newspaper editors and former union generals frequently applauded him and gave him a standing ovation at the end of his mellifluous address a band played way down south in dixie although the northern press did not accord the orator the almost unstinted praise which subsequent mythology has bestowed upon grady many northern editors naively greeted enthusiastically this milestone on the road to reunion as an invitation to expand their investments in what was still in large measure the old south booker t washington embellished the myth of the new south in his equally famous and more effective address at atlanta georgia on september washington had less excuse than did grady for this continuation of the myth in fact washington had previously excoriated the myth in an address to the womens new england club of boston january washington condemned the sharecropping system more vehemently than frederick douglass had done years earlier in an address to the american social science association washington pointed out that schools for negroes were kept open only three and a half months in the rural areas of alabama he flatly contradicted grady and stated that railway accommodations in the south for negroes were inferior to those for whites washington went further and accused grady of not telling the truth about the new south here are washingtons exact words it would have been the simple truth if mr grady had said that in the whole of georgia and alabama and other southern states not a negro juror is allowed to sit in the jury box and while on that subject mr grady might have added even at the risk of spoiling his rhetoric the information that since freedom there have been at least colored men in the south murdered by white men and yet with perhaps a single exception the record of no court shows that a single white man has been hanged for these murders if time would admit an analysis of mr gradys speech i would reveal other equally untrue statements washington did take time later in this speech to state that southern white men privately admitted that they kept the negro vote from being counted whenever that vote might have a controlling influence in an election the next year confirmed washingtons reference in this speech to the disenfranchisement of negroes mississippi adopted the first constitutional amendment in the postreconstruction period for the express purpose of preventing large numbers of negroes from voting and of allowing equally unqualified whites to vote what then is the explanation for washingtons apostasy at atlanta on september when he concluded his address with a prayer to god that a determination to administer absolute justice coupled with material prosperity will bring into our beloved south a new heaven and a new earth was he as cynical as henry iv of france had been when he justified his apostasy with the famous remark paris vaut bien une messe henry iv became a catholic in order to gain control of france washington became an admirer of the new south in order to gain control of negro leadership how fortunate it was for frederick douglass that the great abolitionist and advocate of equal rights for negroes had died seven months before washingtons vain attempt to salvage as much of the promise of emancipation as he could but there were negroes in the audience at atlanta who understood as douglass probably would have understood the blow that washington had delivered to the promise james creelman a well known reporter of the new york world observed that at the end of the speech most of the negroes in the audience were crying perhaps without knowing just why washington was later moved perhaps to tears also at the same time that he was delivering his compromise address south carolina was preparing its constitutional amendment to disenfranchise and disfranchise negroes in the united states supreme court for the first time sanctioned the principle of separate but equal accommodations mckinley in his inaugural address made a donothing promise which should have warned washington that he could not rely upon the new south the white house the supreme court or congress for the protection of negroes civil_rights mckinley promised it will be my constant aim to do nothing and permit nothing to be done that will arrest or disturb this growing sentiment of unity and cooperation this revival of esteem and affiliation which now animates so many thousands in both the old antagonistic sections but i shall cheerfully do everything possible to promote and increase it the decline of the populist movement the gradual disappearance of negroes from southern state legislatures the valedictory in of george h white the last negro of the postreconstruction era in the house of representatives the continued disfranchisement by southern states of negroes the lynching of almost negroes a year the inequitable allotment of public school funds led booker t washington as early as to express publicly his disillusionment at the same time leading northern magazines and newspapers continued to lampoon negroes congress refused to enforce the second section of the fourteenth amendment which required a reduction in the number of representatives to which a state was entitled if it denied the right to vote for any reason except for participation in rebellion or other crimes the federal government refused to enact new laws or to enforce the remnants of the reconstruction laws to protect the civil_rights of negroes for these reasons i have called the beginning of the twentieth century the nadir the lowest point in the fulfillment of the promise of emancipation but in august william edward burghardt du bois born in the year when the fourteenth amendment was added to the constitution refused to accept the virtual nullification of the promise of emancipation at the second meeting of the niagara movement this one at harpers ferry he stoutly asserted we shall not be satisfied to take one jot or tittle less than our full manhood rights we claim for ourselves every single right that belong to a freeborn american political civil and social and until we get these rights we will never cease to protest and assail the ears of america du bois thus gave a new meaning to the declaration of independence the emancipation proclamation the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments in a white mob ran amok in springfield illinois the only city in which lincoln had owned a home william english walling sounded a new call to arms in his article race war in the north in the independent september either the spirit of the abolitionists of lincoln and lovejoy must be revived and we must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and social equality or vardaman and tillman will soon have transferred the race war to the north the stouthearted declaration of du bois at harpers ferry in the scene of john browns raid in had not aroused the conscience of many americans white or negro but the mob in springfield illinois had in a paraphrase of the memorable words of talleyrand about one of bonapartes mistakes committed worse than a crime it had committed a blunder the mob startled the ideological heirs of the abolitionists oswald garrison villard a grandson of william lloyd garrison drafted the call for a meeting on the centennial of lincolns birthday the signers of the call eminent men and women negro and white protestants jews catholics and freethinkers signed the call in the course of organizing a more perfect union of the neoabolitionists the leaders held an open meeting at cooper union may in new york city where abraham lincoln had delivered one of the most effective addresses of his career an address which in the opinion of many historians won the support of the east for the homely uncouth railsplitters candidacy for the presidency of the united states in may there was organized the permanent body to be known as the national association for the advancement of colored people the first president was moorfield storey who had learned his abolitionist principles from charles sumner oswald garrison villard was the disbursing treasurer du bois the only negro official at that time was director of publicity and research what a colossal blunder the springfield mob had committed du bois moved from atlanta to new york and in the pages of the crisis castigated the conscience of america he also started a new generation of heirs to garrison douglass and lincoln whatever one may think of du bois today his earlier role of winning disciples to his harpers ferry declaration places him in the forefront of the neoabolitionists who have participated in the new quest for the fulfillment of the promise of emancipation after the formation of the naacp in and soon thereafter of the national urban league the low rugged plateau began to merge into hills and then into peaks from which one could view the promised land the role of the naacp of the nul of the association for the study of negro life and history of negro newspapers churches schools writers artists athletes participants in sitins freedom rides and of white organizations and individuals constitutes a glorious chapter in the history of the united states this chapter can not be written here but its chronology destroys a myth which i have recently heard in the united states europe latin america and even in africa according to this myth negroes began definitely to move toward the promised land since and as a result of the cold war with the soviet union now the cold war began in years after the formal organization of the naacp and of the national urban league years after the supreme court declared peonage unconstitutional years after the court declared the grandfather clause unconstitutional years after the court ruled that state laws permitting residential segregation were unconstitutional it would be an act of supererogation to list other decisions in which the court prior to almost unremittingly ruled in favor of the civil_rights of negroes six years before the beginning of the cold war president franklin d roosevelt signed executive order which popularized the concept of nondiscrimination on account of race color religion or national origin in the state of new york enacted the first state law containing this new promise of emancipation it is on the other hand true that the cold war accelerated action by government organizations and private individuals as early as may acting secretary of state dean acheson had written to the fair employment practice committee i think it is quite obvious that the existence of discriminations against minority groups in the united states is a handicap in our relations with other countries the department of state therefore has good reason to hope for the continued and increased effectiveness of public and private efforts to do away with these discriminations and president trumans committee on civil_rights added in its report to secure these rights the united states is not so strong the final triumph of the democratic ideals is not so inevitable that we can ignore what the world thinks of our record but i submit that the momentum gained before accelerated action without going so far as do mechanistic philosophers of history i believe to a certain degree in the rhythm of social change a rhythm which was increasing in tempo prior to and on the whole still continues negro youth by dr ralph j bunche have no mandate to i f speak on behalf of any one but myself but i know what i who have been for years an american of negro ancestry want and how i feel i do not doubt that my wants and feelings are fairly representative of those of most of my race i want to be a man on the same basis and level as any white citizeni want to be as free as the whitest citizen i want to exercise and in full the same rights as the white american i want to be eligible for employment exclusively on the basis of my skills and employability and for housing solely on my capacity to pay i want to have the same privileges the same treatment in public places as every other person but this should not be read by anyone to mean that i want to be white or that i am pushy seeking to go where i am not wanted far from it i am as proud of my origin ancestors and race as anyone could be indeed i resent nothing more than a racial slur or stigma i want to go and to do only where and what all americans are entitled to go and to do this i think is what every american negro feels it may be expressed in polite eloquence by some in bitterness or even outright belligerence by others it may cause some just to break out and start to knock things around but in each case the emotion is sound and urgent and american i believe i could readily understand and accept this if i were not a negro if i were white i can never really understand why the white man whether from south or north seems to find it difficult to do so i am not sure that he does it is possible that deep down in his heart he knows that the negro cause is right and just that i think may explain why there is so much less of racial tension in southern and northern communities today than there was a quarter century ago despite the fact that the negro is bolder and more demanding and that the walls of segregation have been often breached why raceriots do not occur why ku klux klansmen now just meekly hand out leaflets i cannot understand how anyone claiming to be a good american can condone the denial of these elementals of democracy to any other american how can anyone be so manifestly against the very essence of americanismnot to mention fairness and decencyand at the same time purport to be fighting communism while thus giving to the communists the strongest weapon they have against us negro citizens may be pardoned for expecting their white fellow citizens to be at least consistent the logic and the evidence are all against the racebaiting bitterenders it is so obvious that no one can miss it that the south at it has reluctantly lowered some of its racial bars is better offpolitically economically and culturally than it has ever been the greatest resource of any community state or nation is its people and it is recklessly shortsighted to waste that resource as the south and to only lesser extent the north has been doing for so long depriving the negro worker of fair employment costs the nation dearly in lost manhours production consumption and taxes i suppose i speak with an unavoidable bias but i feel that if i were a white citizen in the south today i would look at my black or brown brother and say to myself what responsibility do i share for the crime that has been perpetrated not alone against this individual but against the community and the nation what have i contributed to the degradation of this fellow american who except for a sheer accident of birth could be me or my brother what can i do to rectify an injustice to the individual and a loss to the nation this being youth night i really should close on a word especially for youth although i do not care very much for distinctions among people even on the basis of age white or black old or young the real test comes in what you have done or can do in a competitive world you must rise to meet the competition that means preparation it also means building up confidence on the basis of demonstrated performance in connection with preparation the school dropout figures for negro youth are alarming it is an exciting and inspiring world to be in and although there are great dangers in it much tension and cause for worry it affords vast opportunitygreater i think for youth black as well as white than has ever been known ours is a great country great not only in its physical resources and technological capacity but also in its ideals and its political structure and in its ability to admit its faults openly and try to do something about them that is the case with our problemthe negro problem it is after all a credit to the virility and fidelity of our system that a minority group such as ours can carry on a successful struggle for its rights there are unhappily not very many countries in the world today where this can be done i think that democracy is the very best way of life we have an obligation as citizens to make it work here as it is supposed to work in doing that we are helping the nation as well as ourselves it seems to me that in our concern with the threat of communism we do not do justice to our own system we permit communism to become an obsession with us and force us into a defensive and negative posture my concern is with democracy not communism i believe that the best counter to the threat of any ism is never to be obsessed by it and to concentrate on making our own far superior system of democracy work up to the maximum of its potentiality we can never afford to be complacent but i see the outlook as good for us the outcome is certainthe negro citizen will one day walk in this society without stigma the naacp firmly dedicated to our advancement and always in the forefront of our struggle affords unfailing leadership in that struggle it merits the unqualified gratitude of every negro indeed of everyone who loves democracy and decency the negro who does not support the naacp is selling his own future short the naacp will i am sure be flexible enough in its program and approaches to deal with all situations it will develop new tactics to meet new needs i have some concern about a growing tendency toward a proliferation of organizations working in the civil_rights field we can only weaken our effort by an excessive diffusion of our limited resources of leadership and finance i may say also that i have always been disappointed about the membership roll of the naacp since most negroes ardently wish that we strive for most negroes ought to be members of the organization the naacp should have a mass base it should boast millions of members and much more ought to be done toward that end increasingly u s public opinion rallies to our cause the principles and objectives of the un support us most of the world is behind us we can and will eliminate this moral shame from the nation finally i would say to every young negro dont ever lower your sights dont let the fiction of race impair your vision or narrow your horizon of hope never think in terms of limitationsthere need be none at least none that you cannot overcome resolve to do what you aspire to do and eliminate the racial factor in your calculation train for what you want to do break into it face it with confidence and above all defend your dignity as men and women with all you have a strange kind of love by lillian smith speaks in the rebel of a kind of love sists on changing mens lives a love complex critical and often reacted to with hatea love which sometimes turns itself into hate when the rebel does not understand his rebellion you cannot come close to the present nonviolent movement in the south without feeling this strange love it warmsand it burns it reveals mens depthsand heights it appeals to their compassion down with jin cm and it stirs their hate it is conciliatingand it is adamant it is a powerful thing men do not always behave creatively in its presence gandhi knew wellno one knew betterthe potency and the i dangers of the nonviolent way of bringing about change the ritual istic acting out of the need for change and no one has used this way more successfully one reason for his successthere were others lay in his stern refusal to let his followers forget the seductive ease with which their own natures could misuse this ritualistic weapon he warned them that regardless of selfdiscipline or the righteousness of their cause or the desire not to harbor resentment in the act of protest itself lies dormant violence it does not followhis life made this plainthat protest should not occur nor that men have devised a better or more effective way to bring about change than by the use of the nonviolent protest among enlightened southerners there is today more argument about this than about segregation itself few approve openly of martin_luther_king the moderates who are amenable to slow change angrily protest the negroes use of this method even those who have been active for full desegregation of public facilities and hundreds of thousands of whites are seem to feel a curious resentment toward these nonviolent ritualsor is it an undefined fear however we name it many of our best people are attacking the nonviolent methods and philosophy which the students and dr_kings group are using it is of these that i write for they are now the makers of public opinion the day of the rabid segregationists the obscene demagogues is overas recent elections in georgia have shown mississippi is just beginning its ordeal and at present there is little likelihood that leadership will arise there bold enough to free the people quickly from their servitude to the past the problem is the old one of states rights vs human rights it is clarified as a matter of constitutional law for governor barnett is defying the federal courts he has failed in his attempt to interpose this state between young meredith and the highest court of the land every thoughtful american knows his attempt had to fail it is as simple as that as citizens of the usa we owe the highest court our obedience mississippians are not exempt whatever we may think of the law it must be obeyed as it is interpreted by the supreme court the president was of course compelled to see that obedience was given what price mississippians will pay for their defiance we do not know it is possible that the oxford ordeal will have the final effect of clearing their minds of the myths and fantasies which the demagogues have for so long substituted for the truth there is in much of the south however a more benevolent flexible mood then why this angry resentment of martin_luther_king and the sitin students it is not segregation we are defending an albany citizen wrote me we were going to accept desegregation of schools quietly at least a token desegregationuntil these negroes started demanding things now look at the anger in our town is it right to break laws as a protest should young negroes be encouraged to go to jail shouldnt they be taught instead to be respectable whether or not albany would accept without resentment any kind of desegregation is highly problematical but it is true that its citizens voted against the demagogue griffin and for the more moderate sanders for governor the letter just quoted from was written by a highly intelligent woman who has often spoken out against segregation now she is confusedand she says her liberal friends are you can remind them there may be a specious tinge in their insistence that negroes obey local statutes when our officials many of our congressmen and many business men have urged the whites not to obey the directives of the supreme court you can remind them that in countries distant from us we call young men who fight for their freedom heroes not jail birds even though they are thrown into prison but we miss the point by indulging in such epicyclic arguments the reason for this moral and mental confusion lies not in the rational part of minds but closer to the mythical much of it is down where stereotypes are made for nearly a century we southerners have stereotyped not only the negro but ourselves we now find it difficult to see ourselves or negroes as complex human beings each with varying gifts and differences and all with the same civil_rights instead we see ourselves as nice people who if not pushed too hard will give negroes a bag of goodies now and then we see ourselves graciously handing them little bits of their rights which are not ours to hand doling them out as we or our grandfathers used to dole out fat bacon and sweets and cornmeal at christmas we see ourselves shimmering in an aura of kindness we feel goodhearted and often gently tender as we give our little presents but they are not ours to giveah this is what hurts the negroes are reminding us their rights are not ours to give as we see fit but theirsgiven them as human rights by god and as civil_rights by the u s constitution what hurts is watching this nice image of ourselves crumble to dust for as the negroes sit in or picket or quietly stand in front of city hall asking for a conference with the mayor or the city council they are not begging nor bowing and scraping they are with dignity and selfdiscipline asking for what is theirs and asking for it now and suddenly the stereotypes we have made of them and of us collide and clash and break into splinters we feel nakedly exposed as we stare at our real selves and stunned as we stare at them these are not nice negroes who are satisfied with things as they are but human beings wanting for themselves and their children the right to grow to learn to question to become to feel secure in their home towns and as we glimpse ourselves we see something queasily dishonest which we cannot bear to acknowledge how can we be so proud of our kindnesses to the few negroes we know when we have stubbornly kept from all negroes their civil_rightsrights that are as much theirs as our civil_rights are ours let me say at once the personal kindnesses shown by white individuals to negroes the compassion revealed in thousands of small deeds the sacrificial acts the risking of their lives now and then by whites who have loathed the white supremacy systemand there have been always from civil war days thousands who didare the most precious part of our southern cultur in spite of demagogues in spite of restrictions which have bitten as deep into our lives as into negroes lives many white southerners have been gentle kind and have maintained relationships of genuine quality with negro individuals i say quickly too that i want no world where only civil_rights are observedhowever fairly they are observed we need both our rights and the mercy of others we cannot live as human beings in a world without grace right here is the fatal flaw in communism which theoretically says mercy grace and generosity in human relations are not needed but neither can men live as men without their civil_rights there is no eitheror there must be both and dramatically though quietly the gestures words and ritualistic acts of the nonviolent protesters have brought this home to us brought it with the same kindness and grace a few white individuals through the troubled decades have shown to them i am willing to say that had there not been those good and valid personal relationships through the last century a nonviolent movement could not have drawn negroes to its philosophy they would have found it too hard to forgive but there is another cause for the resentment of methods used by the nonviolent group many suffer a severe psychic difficulty in dealing with this strange love compassion from someone you consider beneath you or whom you have harmed enrages youif you are easily enrageda forgiving spirit in a negro can as one man said to me make you want to tear him to pieces what is he forgiving me for what have done things boil inside guilt chokes kindness arrogance claws at fairness the truth is that we can meet nonviolence creatively only if we respect nonviolence we can relate to compassion only if somewhere in us there exists a little compassion we can give justice only if we value justice we can respond to humor in some of these situations only if we value humor the nonviolent philosophy is a catalyst powerful and difficult in its spiritual demands and there is something else it is human not to want to be put in a position where we act or despise ourselves for not acting the negroes nonviolent protests bring to a town its moment of truth we can no longer slide along complacently we are compelled to make decisions right or wrong suppose for instance you walk into a drug store where negro students are sittingin at the lunch counter there they are quietly sitting on the stools usually reading school books sometimes the bible you watch suddenly white hoodlums edge in one slaps a student another sticks a burning cigarette in a black the students do not move every muscle in you aches to help these students and yet you do nothing you would tackle the hoodlums maybe but you tell yourself you might start a riot and you might and suddenly you are sick with guilt how can you stand there then as suddenly anger overcomes your guilt and you yell silently to the students fight back but the nonviolent protesters just sit there taking the blows taking the burning cigarette now something else happens inside you a nasty indecent something whispers ok cowards let the hoodlums use the chain on you see if i care you walk out you have not done or said a thing but you are sick all over for you do care what happens you cant help but care and suddenly you are raging mad with yourself and with the hoodlums and with the students and you settle the stinging turmoil inside you by saying it is these negroes who are disturbing the peace of our town things were fineuntil they came or maybe you are a prominent businessman sitting in your office trying to make a profitable deal for your firmand beyond you is this spiritual turmoil this challenge you know it concerns you and your children but there is this deal to pull offso you turn your moment of truth over to the chief of police and tell him to handle those negroes who are disturbing the peace whose peace yours the hoodlums they have certainly disturbed something in your townbut not its peace only its apathy itsr complacency its paralysis in the face of a changing whirling world that wont wait no matter how loudly we americans south or north beg it to wait and they have mixed up your values they have disturbed your peace of soul and mindfor we have not measured up to the moral challenge offered us the biggest that will be offered us in our lifetime and now and now we are touching a sensitive thing hard to grasp firmly and bring up for eyes to look at segregation itself what has this way of life done to us all have we whites by its terrible logic changed from human beings into hollow men where is our virtue our excellence did we trade it for white superiority have we in this cultural nightmare turned into the stereotype we made of the negros soul is it we who are satisfied with things as they are is it we who are apathetic and without courage to speak up for the rights of our own and other children to grow and become where is the hollowness we thought we had made when in stereotyping the negro we scooped out his love of freedom his spiritual dignity his hope is it now inside our own souls did we think we could dehumanize the negro without dehumanizing ourselves and now we are touching something else the dynamic quality of change itself how can we change the southern way of life without changing ourselves without learning to think with honest logic the nonviolent movement is telling us by its philosophy and its ritualistic acts that change comes not only by a few external acts but by a great many internal acts it is forcing us although its leaders may be only dimly aware of itinto embarking on an orphic journey it is compelling us to seek the hidden poetic truth in this tumultuous agony to reach deep into our hell and grasp eurydice by our questions and lure her close enough to our hearts to feel her once more this movement not by its nonviolent methods but by the reiteration of those powerful words love compassion redemption grace is compelling us to search for truth that of our region and of ourselves their radiating power reminds us that we must find a new way of relating ourselves not only to each other but to reality itself to the times we live in to ultimate concerns and some of us had thought we could skin out of the dark bitter past without even admitting we had done wrong we had thought a little token desegregation would rub out a century of our calendar of sins how simple minded and how blank we have been the black muslimsgrowing steadily in power and influence are telling negros to beware the nonviolent movement those negroes and that martin_luther_king are actually forgiving white folks for centuries of sins they are appeasers ready to settle for integration well we are not we want black supremacy and are going to get it someday well make the whites pay for their sins but the whites are not listening to the black muslims they are resenting wasting precious time resenting the firm quiet offers made by dr_king and the students and other leaders to reason together and work things out the nonviolent protesters are demanding their rights yes but at the same time they are offering us not black supremacy not a black kkk not black mobs but gifts of good will conciliation forgiveness they dont want to take our rights away as do the black muslims they only want theirs but the big story which many are missing is that now has come their time to heal broken relationships to give presents of mutual forgiveness and a mutual bearing of spiritual burdens this arouses in some not warmth not gratitude not awe but anxiety they find this strange love offered us this passion for our common welfare and common future extremely disturbing one man said this let the black muslims come i prefer them to these damned nonviolent niggers i know what to do with a black muslim but what does one do when offered forgiveness and love this means weve gotta straighten things out as one white put it and how hard this now seems to people who had convinced themselves that a little token desegregation would do it then business could go on as usual art could go on as usual philosophy religion could go on as usual politics and nownow we know better a man must accept limits to his rebellion as camus so wisely said whether it is rebellion against the past or the future if the word moderation has any meaning left in it after its misuse for the past decade it lies in this necessity to accept limits the nonviolent group has done so its members exclude physical violence and verbal arrogance they exclude resentment they try never to refuse a chance for conciliating talks but they put no limit on each individuals capacity for forgiveness no limit on compassion no limit on willingness to help bear the white mans psychic burdens this is in effect a tremendous spiritual challenge to white southernersone many of us are unable to rise to at present these acts these wordshow are we to answer where have we put the limits to our rebellion against change are limits set only against mobs terrorists arsonists demagogues only against the closing of our schools have we set limits to our arrogance our hubris our complacency our refusal to see what the future demands of us can we meet compassion with compassion justice with justice reconciliation with reconciliation there can be no limits to love it must be and is durable and longlasting there can be no limits to honor and justice and mercy only a profound humility can say we have done wrong and are even now doing wrong it requires character to be humble character to accept this strange love offered by negroes to help us bear the burdens of our common future and our common fears this strange love is the essence of the christian religion its roots go deep into the jewish religion it is what valid religion is about that superb writer charles williams now dead but well remembered in england a friend of t s eliot and c s lewis speaks in his essays and novels more clearly than any contemporary writer of the love that says let me bear your fear for you you can then do what you need to do let me ease you of your anxiety i cannot do your work this you must do but i can bear your fear and though the leaders of the nonviolent movement have not used these words they in their ritualistic acts and their conciliating talk are saying to the white south you have no need to fear revenge or malice from us all we ask is that you let us help bear the fears you have for the future all we want is to help meet that future with courageand with grace but many whites turn away saying they make mistakes too they are not always forgiving some of their leaders do foolish things of course they do some of their leaders have not as yet made their own orphic journey others commit tactical errors a few are not spiritually concerned enough for this ordeal some of the college kids are thinking more about their rights than they are of what they will do with these rights some of the young northern whites in the movement feel more anger toward white southerners than compassion though all are courageous this is true and because they have undertaken a rigorous vocation they must demand all that is possible of themselves or get out of the movement but all groups all movements even saints come short of perfection what this group is saying to the south and the nation is worth listening to worth reaching out for let us stifle our angry shouts and try to hear the small voice that is speaking to us it is possible this philosophy these conciliating nonviolent acts may save us even though some say we dont deserve saving from the eye for an eye the tooth for a tooth rage of those black supremacists who have succumbed to a ravening hunger for revenge if we listen in time the beanpickers by robert knight ater on this year or maybe even now your local newspaper will run an ad similar to this one wanted to men to harvest vegetables apples or what have you apply your local employment office i like many unemployed boys decided to look into this i went to my local employment office to get more information on the subject i was told that this place was in upstate new york you would get fiftycents for every bushel of stringbeans picked and that the transportation would be free a bus would be leaving the employment office at oclock that friday morning that nice sleeping quarters would be at your disposal providing you brought your own blankets and sheets oh it sounded good i figured that i could pick at least bushels a day but i was in for a surprise as i was later to find out i rushed home and told mom and dad about it dad admitted that it sounded good and since the employment office seemed to have all the statistics about it he assumed that it was ok but mom was against it for she had heard that such trips only ended in hardships dad and i finally persuaded her to let me go some friends of mine were also going i packed my luggage and could hardly wait until friday came friday finally came and we went to the employment office the bus was already there a shagglylooking bus with florida plates the driver and his two companions were sloppily dressed and had the smell of alcohol about them the man that had interviewed us earlier called our names from a long list as we boarded the bus as we rode off i noticed that the bus was filthy dirt at least two inches thick was on the floor with an assortment of wine and sodapop bottles here we were about thirtyfive of us all going to what we thought would be a little easy money we rode all morning and half the afternoon before we finally stopped at a service station and ate we had brought lunches i was glad to get off that stuffy bus and stretch my legs we stayed at the service station for about an hour and we were off again we had gone no more than three miles when i heard this rumbling noise from what seemed to be the motor the bus stopped and the driver got out and looked at the motor and other parts he discovered that the drive shaft had broken all of us got off the bus and sat down on the side of the road the driver hitched a ride to the nearest town to try and get the part repaired it was just about dark when he returned with the disappointing news that the part was beyond repair we slept on the bus that night and i thought id faint for the bus was overloaded and had an awful smell about it morning came and we ate the last of the little food we had brought with us the driver went to a house across the road to make a telephone call i later learned that he had called the farm in upstate new york and told them to send another bus it would take the other bus at least another day to reach us we were about miles from home stranded and without money for food we slept on the bus again that night some of the fellows took their blankets and slept outside but i couldnt put up with those mosquitoes and crawling insects the next morning the driver gave two of the fellows fivedollars to hike to the nearest store four miles away to get baloney and bread for the of us i noticed that the driver and his companions personalities were changing with each mile from bad to worse when the fellows returned from the store they issued each of us a baloney sandwich it was a measly meal but we were thankful early the next morning the other bus arrived it was in worse condition than the first with the exception that it had a good motor we boarded somewhat relieved somewhat depressed we arrived at our destination late that night the sleeping quarters werent ready we were told so we slept on the bus again that night the next morning we looked the place over and i was disgusted at what i saw the rooms looked as if they would cave in if you coughed loud enough grass was growing through the floor and there was hardly any roof over your head you could sit on your bed if you were lucky enough to get one and see spiders and grasshoppers coming through the cracks there were about people at this place some from alabama north and south carolina but the largest portion of them were from florida this place is located about five miles from the little town of earlville n y the camp is situated on a high hill with chicken coopmike shacks scattered here and there if you were lucky enough to get any food they had what was called a cookhouse and you would have to stand in line to use it about noon we asked the man that we had been told was in charge of the place when we were going to get something to eat he told us to see his wife and that she would fix us up we went to his wifes shack to inquire about the food she told us that we would have to put our luggage in pawn to her for the food and when we made some money we could get the luggage back i was too hungry to argue with her so we gave her the luggage the next morning we boarded a bus and rode for nearly an hour before we came upon an enor mously large field where there were at least people picking stringbeans how a person was to make any money with so much competition was beyond me and picking them wasnt as easy as it seemed that day i picked two bushels they call them hampers which was worth a dollar to me i decided that this wasnt for me so a close friend of mine henry and i began saving our dollars and sharing our food how we were going to get our luggage out of pawn was a mystery sometimes while we worked the fellows that didnt work stole our food there was an apple tree not far from the camp with green fruit on it henry and i ate as many of them as we possibly could we finally wrote our parents now that we saw that we couldnt save enough money to come home and told them the condition of things and to send us bus fare but i learned that even your mail wasnt safe so henry and i hiked the five miles to earlville and there we called our parents they accepted the charges and we told them to send the money we had written for care of general delivery to the earlville post office three days later henry and i hiked the five miles back to earlville i was overjoyed when the clerk handed me the letter from mom and dad as if by some miracle there was a letter for henry too we forgot all about our luggage and caught the next bus home when most of the other fellows came home they all had sad tales to tell they said that the foreman began putting up roadblocks to keep the people on the camp for so many were leaving some of the fellows havent come back yet maybe they found jobs up there or something im glad that we got away from that place and ill never go on another of those trips so take it from one who knows the ad in the paper may sound so good but its oh so bad shell never know i came by freda goldstein the agency sent her that fall after i had spinal surgery and was recuperating i had never had household help in my home and didnt quite know how to handle the relationship howdedo maam she was standing at the door of our old house im sarah bowman the agency sent me to help out i opened the door wide and invited her in it will be good to have help she stood in the oldfashioned entranceway almost timidly but i managed to shut the door in back of her i was making progress and was pleased by my sudden mobility she was unobtrusive those first days and said little beyond acquiescent yes maams or no maams it disturbed me to be addressed so formally i wasnt used to servants and in addition didnt care to get used to servitude in the end it was the common ground of being mothers of adolescent girls that changed our relationship mrs bowman had five children but it was rose who dominated her thoughts and conversation rose got a hundred on her examination yesterday she said at first casually shes pretty good at music too she added glancing at my daughters cello resting in the corner course we couldnt afford those piana lessons and didnt have no piana anyway the folks at the settlement said rose could be a concert star it was the same with our library rose likes to read she volunteered glancing at our collection she sure is a great reader or commenting on our girls modest attempts at oil painting rose went to the art classes at the settlement she painted real beautiful pictures as the weeks progressed i shared with mrs bowman the joys and setbacks of her daughters school career the teacher sent for me to come parents night she told me one day by this time she had become comfortable enough to drop the title maam or at least suspected it didnt sit well with me something will have to be done about rose she informed me after the parents meeting shes too durned smart for that school at sixteen years of age the girl was completing high school and the problem now was where to place her as i grew stronger mrs bowmans days with me decreased until by spring she was on a twiceaweek basis i could hardly wait to hear of the progress of roses college applications details of the various campaigns were discussed over coffeeand before mrs bowman got the work under way for the day without being too presumptuous i had given my opinion and suggestions you should aim for an integrated school mrs bowman i finally told her rose will probably have a career in science and should have all the advantages a nonsegregated school has to offer how about my husbands college in view of her ambitions for the girl it was strange she resisted this idea i realized she was fearful rose might get hurt and though i knew her fears were wellgrounded i believed one could not get a liberal education in a narrow environment rose would have to take her chances she would gain in the end i was sure we were down to the last hard details roses teacher said there was some kind of place in the city that could help her get into state college she added unnecessarily we cant pay you know i thought a moment perhaps the teacher means the armstrong association they specialize in placing negro students in graduate school and even on positions maybe they could help roses college career had become an intense and personal thing with me i started for the telephone let me call them i recall how she arose abruptly although not finished with her coffee and said strangely reverting to her old custom no no maam rose will do it herself it was a great day when mrs bowman made the final announcement rose got a full scholarship for the paying university she named a school some miles distant shell be going after the summer this called for more than coffee we had a real celebration rose is graduating first in the class she informed me in early june i wished i could have attended the commencement but no invitation was forthcoming i sent the best gift i could manage mrs bowman was now coming only once a week and always there was a piece of information about roses academic achievements although i was quite pleased with our daughters interests and their progress both in and out of school i fear i prodded them to greater ambition holding up as an example roses attributes the girls determination to do worthwhile things with herself despite the obstacles of her natural environment and the discriminatory barriers she had to hurdle had impressed me tremendously the following fall rose entered the university and immediately began to make giant strides mrs bowman was very pleased i sure never dream when i was little and saw girls from white folks houses go off to college that some day my girl would gojust like them i was almost entirely well by then and since my husbands modest income from teaching had to be stretched to cover the multitude of things one should do when in the academic milieu i had to cut out mrs bowmans weekly visits altogether occasionally she phoned me to see how i was and to bring me to date on roses accomplishments the bowmans didnt have a telephone and i had no way to reach them gradually the calls diminished and then ceased rose became a legend to our girls it was almost summertime when the final call came maam an unfamiliar male voice was on the other end this heres sam sam bowman i had never talked with mrs bowmans husband before and had a sudden premonition of disaster my woman died yestiddy i thought youd wanta know she he faltered she sure was fond of you shocked by the announcement i nevertheless managed to pull myself together sufficiently to mumble some formalities the details of the funeral services now mine i murmured a few kind words and hung up my emotions were mixed between the loss of a good person and roses loss no one else in the family had encouraged or helped her according to mrs bowman they had all referred to her ambitions for her talented daughter as dicty i had had a great affection for sarah bowman and an even greater respect i brushed the warm tears from my face i had never been in that neighborhood before and knew only vaguely where the church was mrs bowman had never said much about her church affiliation it hadnt seemed to play an important role in her life as with me her educational and cultural goals had far exceeded her spiritual drive i left home early the following morning as i was afraid of getting lost but found the church without delay it was empty when i entered it and saw the closed casket down in front of the pulpit i was again alone with sarah bowman i slipped into a seat in the rear and sat in silence watching the sun play on the casket through the stainedglass window it was a small church and it filled quickly it was not until the minister began his service that i realized i was the only white person there i scanned the faces of the teenagers as they entered the first row and wondered which was roses noi rejected a few possibilities she wouldnt dress like that mrs bowman had often told me with pride how the neighboring youngsters had ridiculed roses conservative attire rose couldnt care less what they said she wasnt about to look like a sportin woman as the processional passed i judged the first group of mourners to be the bowman family youngsters of the correct ages clung to a middleaged man but the sixteen or seventeen year old girl alongside of them couldnt have been rose she was disheveled and walked with a sullen swagger brilliant toe nails peeped out of her open sandals as i was physically unable to drive the distance to the cemetery i approached a woman in the group which followed and asked her to forward my condolences to mr bowman at her first opportunity you must be the lady sarah was always talkin about is your mister the pfesser at the college she asked seeming to know of me im sams sister maam she offered its that nocount gal who killed her she continued to volunteer information although i was too embarrassed to comment on this violent assumption all her ma done for her and still she was bad couldnt study jes no good always gittin in trouble too the sisterinlaw paused and sighed nocount thats what they were all cept sarah in an attempt to get her mind off the subject of the bad daughter i said i had no idea mrs bowman was having trouble with any of the girls but she rarely spoke of the othersonly of rose she looked at me quizzically i went on i remember how proud she was when rose got the scholarship to the university i continued i looked for her today but i suppose she hasnt gotten here yet due to the distance of her college the woman stared at me in astonishment what college who you talkin bout rose never went to no college sarah couldnt even git the teacher to keep her in school they dont want no year old gals clutterin up the th grade no more i gazed at her incredulously she added sarah bowman couldnt ever git it in her haid that that gal wuz no good course even if she wuz her color wouldnt help her none she shrugged her shoulders hopelessly guess she figgered twont no use try in anyhow she turned to follow the disappearing mourners and looked back at me sarah sure admired lamin and all the things your chillun done shed sure be glad to know you come to her funeral i returned to my seat alone in the church and gazed at the spot where the casket had stood im glad i thought that shell never know i came the peacocks ugly feet by irene c edmonds earliest recollection of the south concerns itself with a peacock i must have been barely three years old i seem to remember riding through a beautiful place in a buggy with my mother and father i am quite sure that someones especial largesse was responsible for the buggy negro presbyterian ministers had little of the worlds goods at that time the swishing of the horses tail and his sleek brown hind quarters occupied most of my attention until suddenly i looked up and there it wasbehind a high black iron fence its fan was all spread out and the shiny lovely colors sent delicious shivers through my body i was quite sure that the rainbow had fallen from the sky my mother told me that this was a bird called a peacock i begged to stop so that i might reach through the black bars to touch the bright feathers but my mother said that we couldnt stop there to forestall my inevitable why she said something elsewouldnt it be wonderful if the peacocks feet were as beautiful as the rest of his body this time my mother answered my why she said his feet are rather ugly to go with the beauty of the rest of him by then i couldnt see the peacock any more but this is what i remember about the place where i was bom the lovely peacock the high black iron fence my mothers wistful words and the ugly feet that did not go with beauty i did not know until a number of years later that the peacock i could not stop to see was in a public park negroes were not allowed there and so for me the peacock has always symbolized the south as i have known it a land of almost circean beauty that has such tragically ugly feet tomorrow i must find a new image the high iron fences have begun to crack and they will someday tumble the ugly feet have started their tortured metamorphosis slowly but positively as token integration moves toward complete desegregation as overt compliance of the law moves toward personal compliance then shall come the great moral crisis in our american society no one will be able to turn his back on it the metamorphosis will be taking place everywhere and it will affect equally the negro and the white the indifferent and the obstinate the northern liberal and the southern extremist many will find for the first time that the negro problem is not comfortably remote it will assault them directly testing their noble sentiments their moral fibre their christian consciences for many whites i realize the next two decades embody changes not easily imagined or readily accepted the negro will be your neighbor his children will be your childrens schoolmates you will encounter him in new roles as a judge in a court of law as a doctor in a hospital as an elected public official as a college teacher the negro will be a part of the larger society that has thus far shut him out his position in that society will be respectable and commanding of respect in hundreds of different situationsin business in social life in daytoday affairsthe negro will be there not as a meek and different new arrival but as fullfledged equal for me tomorrow holds a promise the time will come when the negro will be fully accepted as a human judged as a man and not as a glass cage representative of his race when that day arrives both white and black shall be free each to be straightforward and at ease with the other the white man must turn and face what he has long been avoiding his own prejudices his doubts and fears and the voice of his conscience he cannot continue to take refuge in the outermost suburbs abandoning his home to declining property values and a new negro ghetto further partitioning of society into white and black is no solution a divided america wastes human resources and perpetuates strife it is no answer at all but an uneasy truce that cannot last but integrationtrue integration of the negro into american society will require both wisdom and courage on the part of whites and negroes alike it will require mutual respect and intelligent planning but most of all it will require honesty not everything that is faced can be changed james baldwin has written but nothing can be changed until it is faced the time has now come for us to turn our backs forever on the big twohearted river already the winds of change have begun to blow across the countryfrom south to north testing the moral fibre and courage of the people both black and white we are nearing the fateful moment of personal decision especially in the south it is right and proper that the pressures and demands by the negro for equality and first class citizenship should begin in the south for the south perpetuated the system which enslaved him and though the emancipation proclamation and the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the constitution gave the negro his freedom and civil_rights the south refused to grant him these rights and privileges the circumventions and subterfuges which the south devised to evade the law were all designed for one purpose to keep the negro from ever being admitted to full citizenship this purpose in time became a sacred principle and the south where honor was once the watchword accepted its own fraudulent fabrications as truth in doing this the south lost inevitably some of its character this theme pervades the body of faulkners works so it is right and proper that the pressures and demands for freedom by the negro should begin in the south the south has sinned most against him and there are many good men in the south who think this but it should be pointed out that the difference between the treatment of the negro in the south and that in the north is one of degree and outward show and not in kind segregation discrimination and exclusion of the negro in the north are not legalized but all are practiced against him what the south accomplished by law tradition grandfather clauses and the poll tax the north accomplished by restrictive covenants ghettos and the unspoken word if the negro is a commodity and the white mans burden in the south as faulkner labels him in the north he is a statistic and a remote impersonal problem unconnected with human experience the south thinks it knows the negro and that all of them are alike the north thinks it set him free each belief steeped in myth and illusion distorts the vision and paralyzes the will the north like the south shows little concern about providing equal job opportunities for the negro a study of aid to dependent children in cook county illinois showed that of the job orders placed with private employment in per cent barred nonwhites still the south is more culpable even when the negro is well prepared for the job the for white only tabs traditionally exclude him no wonder walter lee younger the hero in lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun cries out to his mother in such anguish sometimes its like i can see the future stretched out in front of me just plain as day the future mama hanging over there at the edge of my days just waiting for mea big looming blank space full of nothing just waiting for me pause mamasometimes when im downtown and i pass them cool quietlooking restaurants where them white boys are sitting back and talking bout things sitting there turning deals worth millions of dollars sometimes i see guys dont look much older than me so both the north and the south using an elaborately contrived rationale attempt to put to sleep the agonizing aches of christian consciencethe north by the opiate of looking the other way the south by the opiate of living a life which is built on legendary and myth each accuses the other of injustice and intolerance to the negro yet each denies the negro that which every human being must have the dignity of being human no more and no less eliza doolittle in bernard shaws pygmalion discovers a provocative and perceptive truth on her way up from the gutter to respectability via the route of phonetics the difference between a flower girl and a duchess is not in the way she behaves but in the way she is treated to make an analogy the basic difference between a negro and a white person is not in the way he behaves but in the way he is treated what the negro wants more than anything else is to be treated as a mana human being this is no new concept others have said it just as earnestly before me and others will say it with equal earnestness after me but all the racial ferment in our land today has its roots in this one great human want on its insistence by the negro on its resistance by the white man three years ago i remember looking into a pair of eyes that belonged to a young negro college student they were bright with heldback tears as he wrestled with himself over choosing to be fined or to go to jail he had been arrested for participating in a sitin at a lunch counter in a variety store to pay the fine meant graduation on schedule no jailbird stigma and no prolonged expense to his widowed mother to go to jail meant paying the price for his belief in human dignity and freedom he chose the jail before that i had seen those same two eyes overflow with tears of love and pride for country when he heard the starspangled banner backstage in auditoriums in many african schools and cities he was participating in a cultural exchange program sponsored by the state department and our mission was to demonstrate american democracy and freedom to africans through the drama and by our persontoperson contacts we always played the national anthem before our show and there were nearly always tears in our eyes when we heard it it seemed a tragic paradox to me that this young man should have to cry in america over what he went to sell to africa there are other things the negro wants in addition to human dignity he wants the freedom to enjoy all the privilegesand responsibilities of full american citizenship he wants the freedom to educate himself where he chooses to compete fairly for a job for which he is qualified to eat and live and go where he wills to exercise his right to vote when he wishes to recreate where he desires and to pray in the church of his choice conversely there are things the negro does not want he shrinks from paternalism however disguised not because he needs no help but because paternalism relegates him to the status of a child and robs him of his right to make choices he does not want pity he does not want things made easy for him because he is negro the double standard is dead for him he is through with jim crow and back entrances over and above the hysteria of last ditch stands the racebaiting leaflets and newspaper editorials the white citizens councils and the black muslims the little rocks and birminghams and new orleans the senescent uncle toms the bull conners and mrs gaillots the headinsand gradualists and the extremists of the right and left stand counterposed the ralph mcgills and archbishop rummels the atlantas and mariettas and dallases the martin_luther_kings and thurgood marshalls the freedom rides and sitins the naacp and core and the southern christian leadership conference world opinion and the men of good will in both races giving impetus to change are the impatient ambitious raceconscious young negroes and their sympathetic young white confreres giving substance is the law of the land in the next two decades the pressures will mount even higher as the horizons of negroes widen their demands will be more insistent integration and desegregation will become accomplished fact increasingly the demands of negroes will beat with imperious insistence upon the ears of the white man on the liberal in the north on the moderate in the south on white men throughout our land it will beat upon negro ears too in an editorial in the atlanta constitution ralph mcgill predicts the various movements of today the sitins the freedom rides and the moves for equal citizenship which the constitution and the statutes provide are not going away until the admitted injustices are removed this in essence is the souths dilemma what will this mean to the negro what will it mean to the white man what will be the response these questions must be faced and answered for the negro the challenge will mean an identification as an american involved in the whole stream of american life this does not mean that he will have to surrender his racial heritage he may have to lose some sense of race he will surely have to lose the sense of inferiority which was fostered in him by the white man he will have to do something on his own initiative without making excuses about the crime and illegitimacy and school dropouts among his people even though he knows that poor and crowded housing and lack of job opportunities are the cause of these ills he will have to assume the responsibility for their remedy the causes cannot absolve him from solutions in addition the negro will have to help close the cultural gap between the races this will be true particularly for the southern negro even though he has wrought the major part of his own transformation from slave to responsible citizen he will have to erase the educational deficiencies occasioned by a separate but unequal school system he will have to compete on a professional level by a single standard for educational and job advancement it also follows that the negro in both the north and the south will have to take full and responsible advantage of the rights and privileges he fought for and gained this includes the ballot he will have to look with sympathy and understanding upon the agony of change whether it be in the white man or the black man he will have to learn that compromise is not synonymous with surrender whatever bitterness he has toward the white man he will have to forget understanding and a consideration for others form the only firm basis for a truly democratic society accomplished integration will have moral implications for the white man in america it will mean first that he must become concerned enough about racial discrimination and injustices that are beyond the reaches of the law to want to do something about them solon is reported to have said upon being asked the condition for perfect justice in athens it will come when those who have not suffered injustice are as indignant as those who have but it is not enough simply to be aware the white man will have to express his indignation in positive action the challenge of personal compliance will mean also that there must be a recognition and an understanding of the negro as a human being the white man will have to give back to the negro the humanity he took away and in so doing regain that portion of his own humanity he lost when he took the negros humanity away it will mean that he must accept with his heart as well as his mind that the negro is a person who possesses the same virtues same faults and foibles same inadequacies same sensibilities same aspirations and hopes and dreams as those he a white man has it will mean the rejection of paternalism however well intentioned yet it will mean the lending of a hand to the negro as both work to close the cultural and educational gap for which he the white man is largely responsible it means having the perceptive insight to know that he has no more to fear from the negro than from any other man in a competitive society for the white south particularly it will mean that the ibsenian ghosts of the past shall no longer rule the life in the present it will mean that the monolithic structure of myth and subterfuge by which the south has denied the negro the basic rights of american citizenship must be demolished it will mean that in this region where both black and white are so deeply rooted and which both love well the freedom road must be no dual highway but one broad expanse where white and black travel together in mutual respect and finally it will mean that christian practice will follow christian ethics to accomplish all this will require the reaching of a moral and intellectual height seldom attained by human beings it calls for more than shallow sentimentality and the remote compassion of northern liberals and southern moderates as the negro moves ahead impatiently and forcefully the challenge will be a direct one assaulting the lives of every american including those who have thus far been peaceably bypassed by the problems and what will be tomorrows promise the feet of the peacock will be beautiful like its body the way they ought to be jazz elder statesman by herbert l wheeldin herever popular w music is played in the united states and that is just about everywhere the name of george gershwin is known and admired among composers he is accorded a preeminent position that is remarked annually in festivals memorials and longplaying tributes less wellknown however is the name of the man who introduced him to jazz gave him his first lessons and enabled gershwin to make the transition from his classical outlook to the sounds of the new music then sweeping the country it was a fortunate day in the short life of gershwin when the great comic artist bert williams first presented him to his teacher and sponsorluckey roberts today roberts endowed with a memory like a strip of photographic film sits and recalls gershwin as though he lived yesterday he reaches back across the years as if they were days torn from a desk calendar yes he tells us i remember george so clearly back in he was selling sheet music at remicks on th st he was burning with ambition to learn the fingering for ragtime piano as jazz was called at the time he nearly threw a fit when i played my composition junkman rag for him the stride beat the crossfingering and the complicated chords were all quite contrary to his classical training but he was quick he had a natural gift for music later on he borrowed from my tune and then ill come back to you in order to write his famous the man i love and even today when i play the two tunes back to back they sound like a couple of peas spit from the same mouth luckey roberts or charles luckeyeth as he was baptized in philadelphia looks back over a career spanning years in the world of entertainment during that time he has attained the proportions of a legend in theatrical and music circles even while he remains unknown to the public at large despite this anonymity he may well be one of the great show personalities of our time his twinkling eyes are deepset in a buddhashaped face creased by a broadbrimmed smile with skin the color of peanut butter short of stature with rolypoly figure he projects an infectious zestful charm that insistently compels his listeners attention indeed his charm a kind of personality magic has affected some of the greatest members of our countrys social establishments who have sought his services and advice for his roster of musical clients and students reads like a rollcall of the social register one of his most publicized pupils was the prince of wales known to our era as the duke of windsor the onetime king of england who yielded his throne for love of an american divorcee again roberts unlocks his memory files when the prince first came here in he was the lion of the social season i remember playing at receptions in his honor for seventeen successive nights at one in particular the sanfords laddiea famous polo player spent for a single nights entertainment why their estate out on long island was decorated for miles around with wax candles it took the servants three hours just to light them up and the princehe was crazy about our music he hung around the bandstand all night and never seemed happier than when i let him sit in on the drums he sort of fancied himself with the brushes from that time on i became his mentor and gave him lessons in rhythm later even after he became king i used to send him records and sheet music so he could keep up with jazz undoubtedly roberts great musical gifts and winning personality made it possible for him to transcend the deep social gulf that separates the negro from the upper strata of society when the young son of president roosevelt wed the daughter of the dupont empire back in paul whiteman was bypassed to insure that luckey roberts should preside over the musical end of the festivities for season after season his orchestras supplied a steady stream of rhythms at the receptions and the cotillions of j p morgan commodore vanderbilt andrew carnegie marquis de cuevas and numerous other families who comprised americas as they were then called and till this day roberts fondly remembers what an apt pupil at the piano was doris duke heiress to the camel cigarette fortune but it is not for his associations that he deserves a footnote in negro history rather is it for his genuine creative abilities which have contributed so much to the growth of popular music in america and the world millions of people are sentimentally indebted to him for his inimitable composition moonlight cocktail an alltime favorite among popular tunes on hearing its lilting melody many persons invariably identify it with glenn miller who made it the musical signature of his orchestra few are aware that roberts composed this song way back in under the title ripples of the nile it proved so difficult for musicians and singers that it lay dormant for over years originally it was a fast number with right hand figuration of the greatest technical difficulty and none of luckeys pupils including the famous james p johnson could execute it perfectly subsequently he found it necessary to score it as a slow number and publish it as moonlight cocktail recently a new england newspaper the hartford courant referred to roberts as the grand old man of jazz music and truthfully speaking roberts is perhaps the oldest living founder of jazz and popular music not only gershwin but rodgers ellington berlin loesser fats waller and all the noted composers are obligated to him in some measure for they benefited by the creative dimension and prodigious technique he brought to jazz he was among the first to apply the contrapuntal effects of bach to jazz and is regarded among musicians as a master of the intricate meshing of counterpoint harmony and rhythm essential to the production of solid music can african students get a better education in africa by brooks johnson african students j studying in the united states this represents an increase of more than per cent over the totals for the academic year it is expected that the percentage increase will continue to rise for it costs approximately a year to maintain a student in the u s for a year this means that approximately was spent to educate african students in the u s for the academic year if the present trend continues we can confidently assume that this year we will see this figure increase another four to six million dollars bringing the total for the year to between and there should rest in no ones mind any doubt that this represents a sizable expenditure to educate people who are nationals of other nations before we proceed further it might help to briefly examine and explore possible motivations for such expenditures the u s population represents nearly per cent of the total world population but it produces per cent of the worlds food supply and consumes all but per cent of this supply at home most of the remainder is shamefully stored at government expense in warehouses the u s has more than times as many possessions as the rest of the world it has times as much steel times as much coal and times as much general equipment as the rest of the world but more than half of the people of the world dont know how to read and write go to bed hungry at night have never heard of jesus christ more than half of them have however heard of marx stalin khrushchev and their ideologies i think these statistics will give the reader some indication why the u s is spending so much money educating nationals from abroad in america for a moment it would be good to utilize a device used in an article by mr henry smith leipur a field secretary for the american bible society let us assume that the world has been compressed to a population of people americans would represent a grand total of most of the remaining would be hungry most of the time the american would eat per cent more than the maximum food requirements they could actually save money by giving the excess food away that they store each year is it any wonder the american having an average income of a year find that they are forced to pay on an average of a year for defense they spend less than a year for gifts other than private and personal gifts one can easily raise the question about the real meaning of the christian faith spirit of christmas peace on earth and good will among men as applied and practiced by the american when these figures are compared it probably is amply apparent that americans dont give as much as perhaps they should or could but still our amounts far exceed those of russia or any other nation americans in terms of dollars and cents give more than any other two nations combined our concern here however will be whether or not america is spending its dollars wisely regarding the education of africans there is a growing feeling among some interested parties that the best place to educate africans is in africa unesco leaders in the congo leopoldville advise if the congo is to have the leadership it desperately needs the congolese must remain here for their higher education or at least in africa from chad comes the report that what is sometimes considered a humorous observation is all too true in too many instances it goes african students if they do return from study abroad come back from soviet countries antired but from paris they return as avowed communists mr m a kabangi congolese minister of planning and coordination says i believe that the hope for peace and progress in this country as in all the new republics of africa is education at every level education in africa for african living in close touch with african cultures and african needs and increasingly by africans themselves to achieve this we need the help of individuals and organizations from abroad who will honestly put our need and the common good of all peoples above their own individual or national interests and prestige by providing their educational help here with many teachers coming to us instead of taking our higher students away with big grants for foreign study the above quotes come from an on the spot report prepared by martha lucas pate a first report on higher education in africa let us consider a case in point in one of the finest universities in africa was founded in the belgian congo lovanium university has been described as being so extensive so handsome and so wellequipped that ones first visit is like seeing a mirage here are some of the reasons for such a statement the university has many modern buildings that are spaciously located on the cam pus which overlooks leopoldville and the valley of the congo river the science laboratories are equipped with advanced and complex equipment not to mention the atomic reactor of which it is the proud possessor the main library has in excess of volumes with regular incoming volumes numbering over in addition there are smaller libraries affiliated with special schools of study such as law medicine bed hospital philosophy science theology social science agronomy psychology and teaching as well as the several museums and the university press the total cost for what was only partially described on the previous page was the equivalent of the university is now equipped to give an education to students the total enrollment is only this is a very interesting fact when one is constantly being reminded how greatly american colleges are overcrowded when asked by mrs pate if the students did any work toward defraying the cost of their education she was told by the assistant rector if we required any physical work there would be no students here they would all accept scholarships abroad when an african student comes to the u s to study the direct benefits of his coming accrue mostly to him the same money that is necessary to educate him here in the u s could be used in africa to establish facilities to educate more people and the process would be repeated over and over again with resultant benefits to a much wider spectrum of the population this fact when taken with certain other considerations would seem to indicate that the most practical and economical use of money to educate africans would be to spend it building african institutions in africa if an african student comes to america and his stay here is a success he is most reluctant to return thus partially defeating the purpose of his coming if he has really benefitted from his stay then there are many scholarships and awards to tempt him to extend his stay even longer if he takes his ba ma and phd here it means he will have been exposed to american standards for more than years after this time it is even more difficult for him to return if on the other hand his stay is not a success what have we accomplished we have exposed him to all the disadvantages of the american democracy and its ideosyncracies and he is a very receptive sounding board for antiamerican propaganda having actually been in america he becomes even more convincing in his arguments against her to his people as one who has returned he of course is in a much better position to lead his country and determine policies than one who hasnt it is not intended to imply that all africans should be limited to studying in africa but it is suggested that many africans are studying in america who would better serve the needs of their own nations by studying at home with american encouragement and aid things happen too swiftly in africa for its gifted nationals to be away from it for extended lengths of time surely there are certain postdoctorate and doctorate scholars who would greatly benefit from study in the u s and in turn the u s would greatly benefit from having invited them this would no doubt be the case at any time and regardless of the educational facilities in africa or the u s but the wholesale luring away of the best young african talent at this time doesnt appear to be the wisest expenditure of educational resources it would appear that economical political propagandaselfish and unselfish and educational considerations dictate that most africans should be educated in africa recently the author had occasion to speak with mr joseph kasongo former president of the chamber of deputies from the congo and presently serving a term as a national deputy i put the idea of educating africans in africa as it appears here a broad smile coyly spread across his face as he informed me that he had given a speech in the chamber of deputies with the very same message and import he put to me what he felt was a crippling consideration certainly the american dollars could buy very fine facilities and buildings perhaps even more than necessary in some cases there was no doubt in many africans minds that the needs of africa and the policies of the u s could best be served by educating africans at home there is certainly no doubt that such programs would have the additional beneficial effect of helping local economies but there still remained for him this one devastating problem who would educate the students in most of the better universities in america there are compulsory retirement ages usually in too many cases these men are still very capable and creative there are literally hundreds of professors emeriti who would more than welcome the opportunity and challenge of plying their talents and vast knowledge to adequatelyequipped schools in africa sponsored by american capital and encouraged by u s goodwill there is currently a great interest in american universities in establishing african studies programs new departments devoted to this field are springing up in colleges around the country almost as fast as football coaches lose their jobs the graduates of these programs usually hold advanced degrees and would welcome the opportunity to teach their various areas of study abroad there are many professors who for various other reasons and considerations would gladly accept teaching positions abroad as mr kasongo heard of these possible professional recruits he punctuated the remarks by pounding his fist in his hand with satisfaction he was evidently sold on the idea of educating africans in africa and the desirability feasibility and advantages of such a scheme his final words spoken with great deliberation and concern now if we can only convince the government of the united states of the merit of this these words stiff point up the pertinent and decisive factors by alf wannenburgh hree men stood in v rjp the dust and looked i at roadsign in two days we shall be in our homecountry said tsolo tsolo maki and temba had been many days on the road to the valley of a thousand hills during the day they walked in the yellow dirt beneath the sun and at night they lighted their fires beside the road and allowed their weariness to drain into the thirsting earth they spoke little for the horror of the place they had left remained with them more than four hundred of their fellow miners had died in the disaster and after three weeks of vain efforts to reach those who had been cut off from them by the fall of rock a funereal quiet had fallen over the workings the silent the sullen the weeping the bewildered wives and relatives who had pressed around the fence had gone and in their place torn newspapers were impaled on the wire barbs by the wind the silent winding gear cut a stark silhouette against the grey sky and the activity of the compound became the despairing preparation for departure of a refugee transit camp the heat of this sun is heavy on our shoulders like the burden of the white mans laws said tsolo freeing his arms and dropping his pack in the dust at his feet or like the suffering of our people at the mine said maki there are some things we shall not speak of said tsolo we will change the laws of the white man but the suffering at the mine can never be changed for a moment they were silent because it was with sadness that they remembered the suffering at the mine let us stay here for the night so that we shall be strong for the walk tomorrow said temba no rather we should walk through the night because then we shall be home by tomorrow evening said maki now that i am almost home my legs are strong and know no tiredness we will stay here said tsolo he led the way through a break in the fence and they followed him into the deeplyetched dry riverbed and that was the way it had always been tsolo was the leader when they had been at home together it had been tsolo who led them to plough and when the inadequate soil had become poor and the crops had failed they had followed him to the labourrecruiting office once they had even followed him to prison but that had been a long time ago his will was the strongest and that was the way it had always been this is a good place said tsolo dropping his blankets in the sand at the foot of the steep bank it would be better if we went where the river turns and where we cannot be seen from the road said maki in this place there is danger there was a silence and then his voice returned there is danger is danger danger who is it that mocks us said maki it is a trick of the hills tsolo replied temba placed his blanket roll firmly beside that of tsolo this is a good place he agreed f so they sat for a while in the fading warmth of the sand and watched the shadow of the bank creep across the riverbed it was tsolo who spoke first do you remember that we came through a fence to get here yes said temba it was you who found the opening for us and what does it mean that we came through a fence it means that we are on the land of a white farmer now if i tell you that my stomach is making the rumbling sounds of hunger then i would say that on a farm such as this there are sheep ah you are a good fellow temba how shall i say a good fellow tsolo said slapping temba on the back yes a very good fellow temba felt good it is from you that i have learnt these things he said their talk sounded faintly in the background of makis thoughts he thought of the joy of the homecoming that was before him and the sorrow of the place that lay behind him of his escape from the falling rocks that had entombed the miners and of the talk that it had happened because of the white mineowners those who had not provided for their safety he thought too of his friend moses yes moses who had lost his life in the disaster only two days before he was due to leave the mine two days before he was to return to his family only two days of how happy he had been and of the laughter in his eyes when he had spoken of his home and then there had been the sound like the report of a great gun and the ceiling of the mine had fallen on his dreams then he remembered the first few days when they had laboured with hope and the many days that followed when they struggled to clear the broken earth without hope but mostly he thought of home and of the anxious period of waiting while those who were returning to mozambique boarded their trains when the three of them knew that their wives would have heard of the sadness that had come to the mine and would worry for their safety then they had been told that they would have to wait a further two weeks for transport to their homecountry and tsolo had rolled up his blankets and spoken and they had followed him he is a dreamer this maki said tsolo yes and a fool for when we speak of sheep we are speaking of food said temba you want me to worry with food when my mind is filled with much bigger things said maki in two days i shall be home with my wife my son will ask me to tell him stories of the things i have seen we shall sit beside the fire and then i shall tell him of the painful things that i have seen in being with my family there is far greater pleasure than in answering the squeals of my stomach am i therefore a dreamer what you have learnt of life is like nothing said tsolo you have learnt to cut coal and to dream but you have learnt no wisdom he spoke with the bitter dust of the road in his voice we cannot live on dreams said temba you speak of home said tsolo but what is this home if it is not a patch of poor soil on which our families must starve if we do not find work on the mines so that we can send money to our children and you speak of this home as if it were heaven you are a dreamer just like the one at the mine who was called moses yes you are like moses shouted temba and the hills repeated you are like moses are like moses like moses i do not like this place we should leave for even the hills mock us for this talk of stealing sheep when we should be on the road said maki ah so now our dreamer is afraid of an echo jeered temba come said tsolo let us leave him to his dreams or his fears there is mens work for us to do but why should we do this thing now when we are so near to home said maki we may be caught and then it will be many days before we can continue on our path these farmers fear us because they are ignorant of us this fear sometimes causes them to do terrible things to us i have my knife ready let us find a sheep said temba yes then let us go said tsolo maki you will make the fire for us while we are gone if we are caught it will be many days he shouted after them as they moved beyond the lip of the bank and they did not reply but the hills answered it will be many days be many days many days then darkness and silence came to the bed of the river and the cold breeze of solitude was chill upon him beyond the towering blackness of the opposite bank filtered light from the invisible moon wove the fabric of the sky with blue threads he gathered the driftwood of a longpast flood and heaped it against a boulder in the sandy centre of the place where the stream had been in the warmth of the flames he felt the companionship of his family if he excluded all else the dancing yellow forms created about him the walls of his hut the gentle love of his wife and he heard the thirsty questions of his son beside him and he planned how he would tell of the many long roads he had traversed to be with him and still he is dreaming the voice of tsolo scorned from out of the dark maki shook himself free of his thoughts as the two figures stepped into the light first tsolo carrying the knife and then temba with the carcass of a sheep slung over his shoulder ha said temba he has not even watched the fire wellmust it also die take this said tsolo handing maki the knife we men have done our worknow it is for the one with the heart of a woman to prepare the sheep for the cooking but if we are found with the blood of this sheep on our hands we shall not reach home said maki must we not eat if we are to have strength for the journey tomorrow said temba you dream of dangerthere is no one here jeered tsolo and the hills confirmed there is no one here is no one here no one here with the knife in his hand maki stood erect before the glowing coals my strength does not come from that which belongs to other men he said tsolo became angry do we not cut coal so that they become rich do we not build roads so that they can drive on them while we must walk has not everything that they have been taken from us you worry because we take this sheep they have taken all from useven our strength but i am already strong shouted maki because i am almost home from the bank above them came a challenge and the sharp crack of a shotgun tsolo and temba fled from the light and vanished into the blackness where the river turned out of sight of the road just beyond the ragged circle of firelight illuminated by the weakening flare lay three bundles of blankets and beside the fire two crumpled heaps the sheep and maki and the hills mocked i am almost home am almost home almost home tales of childhood by john a williams the day joey procopio got his new t sled we all went up to yates castle to slide joeys sled was one of the new ones a flexible flyer if youve known sleds you know theres not much streamlining they can do with them but joeys was as sleek as the empire state express our slide was through bare chestnut maple and oak trees down a hill of about degrees there was a huge oak at the greatest depth of the decline at which we began our turn to keep from shooting over the sidewalk and down into the street we slid all afternoon joey would occasionally allow one of us to use his sled we all agreed that his flexible flyer was the fastest thing on runners we took our penultimate slides and gathered once more at the crest of the hill again for the last one we all went down before joey this time we didnt mind it seemed fitting that the owner of the flexible flyer should be the last one down kind of like a sea captain from the bottom of the hill we watched joey secure and proud in this honor start running with his sled moving it to and away from his body as he ran in crisp strides suddenly he tripped and as he crashed to the ground his head jerking upright to watch it the sled leaped from his hands as though it had a life of its own it sped over roots around bushes and trees speeding downhill its red runners were like streaks of blood against the snow and its golden boards flashed like bits of sun the sled hit the sidewalk and flew straight out into the street and landed on an even keel it was zipping across the roadway when the car came the driver thought a kid was on it and he swung this way and that and finally slammed on his brakes the car spun skidded then jerked out of it with a snap the sled squealing beneath one of its wheels so hard that the runners dug up the snow clear down to the asphalt the driver was shaking when he got out we could not move slowly the driver bent beneath the wheel of the car and looked he had his butt in the air like a chicken eating slowly like the air had been let out of him he sank to his knees and did not move for a long time we looked back up the hill then at joey who was still sprawled on his stomach the driver pulled the sled from beneath the wheel and kicked it to the curb the sled was shattered the runners crumpled the driver got back into his car and drove away slowly and in silence and in the cold which seemed to have come suddenly we clambered down crossed the road and looked at the sled joey came up last and when he saw it he started to cry and none of us could tell him he was lucky he hadnt been on it because he was anticipating the beating his father was going to give him er an cl son had been away two i y days and i was getting hungry tired of g stealing milk from porch stoops and fruits from hucksters some of whom were pretty swift afoot for old men i drifted nearer and nearer home as i approached it circled around it seeing the lights on in the living room i felt very unwanted and unlived i moved further away i walked aimlessly down townsend street which was being demolished for the new housing project only god knows how many of those abandoned homes id pilfered for lead to sell to mr ullman the junkman as i passed the gouged out foundations a voice called out my father i glanced once behind me then raced on up the street only my father and i were on it and he id seen at the first glance had been shopping at the black and yellow painted american store he was clutching two great bags the sight and sound of him immediately reassured me that i never wanted to go home again and so we raced at what age does a son outrace his father seventeen eighteen sixteen my father was a young man used to hard work and baseball and i was far from sixteen in fact i wasnt twelve yet we sped past the shells of homes which caught the sounds of our pantings and of our feet beating a crazy crescendo against the pavement and so we ran and i was pulling away half a foot by half a foot and i knew if i could last to the corner and make the alley i was gone i bent my head my knees came up faster the pavement socked against my toes i swear i could hear the wind racing by wind i was creating but when he called his footsteps falling further and further behind my son my son something within me broke and i slowed then stopped and sat down he trotted up and sat down beside me when we got up he handed me a bag he placed his free arm around my shoulder and its touch told me that it was not to restrain but to feel close i knew i was going to get it though but i went anyway the convert by lerone bennett jr man dont know what g hell do a man dont p know what he is till he gets his back pressed up against a wall now you take aaron lott there aint no other way to explain the crazy thing he did he was going along fine preaching the gospel saving souls and getting along with the white folks and then all of a sudden he felt wood pressing up against his back the funny thing was that nobody knew he was hurting till he preached that red sea sermon where he got mixed up and seemed to think mississippi was egypt as chairman of the deacons board i felt it was my duty to reason with him i appreciated his position and told him so but i didnt think it was right for him to push us all in a hole the old foolhe just laughed brother booker he said the lordhell take care of me i knew then that that man was heading for trouble and the very next thing he did confirmed it the white folks called the old fool downtown to bear witness that the colored folks were happy and you know what he did he got down there amongst all them big white folks and he said things aint gonna change here overnight but they gonna change its inevitable the lord wants it well sir you could have bought them white folks for a penny aaron lott pastor of the rock of zion baptist church a man white folks had said was wise and sound and sensible had come closetoo closeto saying that the supreme court was coming to melina mississippi the surprising thing was that the white folks didnt do nothing there was a lot of mumbling and whispering but nothing had happened till the terrible morning when aaron came aknocking at the door of my funeral home now things had been tightening up you could feel it in the airand i didnt want no part of no crazy scheme and i told him so right off he walked on past me and sat down on the couch he had on his preaching clothes a shiny blue suit a fresh starched white shirt a black tie and his sunday black shoes i remember thinking at the time that aaron was too black to be wearing all them dark clothes the thought tickled me and i started to smile but then i noticed something about him that didnt seem quite right i ran my eyes over him closely he was kinda middlesized and he had a big cleanshaven head a big nose and thin lips i stood there looking at him for a long time but i couldnt figure out what it was till i looked at his eyes they were burning bright like light bulbs do just before they go out and yet he looked contented like his mind was resting somewheres else i wanna talk with you co booker he said glancing sideways at my wife if you dont mind sister brown m sarah got up and went into the living quarters aaron didnt say nothing for a long time he just sat there looking out the window then he spoke so soft i had to strain my ears to hear im leaving for the baptist convention he said he pulled out his gold watch and looked at it train leaves in bout two hours i know that aaron i was impatient for him to get on with it yeah but what i wanted to tell you was that i aint going jim crow im going first class booker right through the white waiting room thats the law a cold shiver ran through me aaron i said dont you go talking crazy now the old fool laughed a great big bodyshaking laugh he started talking bout god and jesus and all that stuff now im a godfearing man myself but i holds that god helps those who help themselves i told him so you cant mix god up with these white folks i said when you start to messing around with segregation theyll burn you up and the bible too he looked at me like i was satan i sweated over this thing he said i prayed i got down on my knees and i asked god not to give me this cup but he said was the one i heard him booker right herehe tapped his chestin my heart the old fools been having visions i thought i sat down and tried to figure out a way to hold him but he got up without saying a word and started for the door wait i shouted ill get my coat i dont need you he said i just came by to tell you so you could tell the board in case something happened you wait i shouted and ran out of the room to get my coat we got in his beatup old ford and went by the parsonage to get his suitcase rachelthat was his wifeand jonah were sitting in the living room wringing their hands aaron got his bag shook jonahs hand and said take care of your mamma boy jonah nodded aaron hugged rachel and pecked at her cheek rachel broke down she throwed her arms around his neck and carried on something awful aaron shoved her away dont go making no fuss over it woman i aint gonna be gone forever cant a man go to a church meeting thout women screaming and crying he tried to make light of it but you could see he was touched by the way his lips trembled he held his hand out to me but i wouldnt take it i told him off good told him it was a sin and a shame for a man of god to be carrying on like he was worrying his wife and everything im coming with you i said somebodys gotta see that you dont make a fool of yourself he shrugged picked up his suitcase and started for the door then he stopped and turned around and looked at his wife and his boy and from the way he looked i knew that there was still a chance he looked at the one and then at the other for a moment there i thought he was was going to cry but he turned quicklike and walked out of the door i ran after him and tried to talk some sense in his head but he shook me off turned the corner and went on up adams street i caught up with him and we walked in silence crossing the street in front of the first baptist church for whites going on around the confederate monument where once they hung a boy for fooling around with white women put it off aaron i begged sleep on it he didnt say nothing what you need is a vacation ill get the board to approve full pay and everything he smiled and shifted the suitcase over to his left hand big drops of sweat were running down his face and spotting up his shirt his eyes were awful all lit up and burning aaron aaron cant you hear me we passed the feed store bill williams grocery store and the movie house a mans gotta think about his family aaron a man aint free didnt you say that once didnt you he shaded his eyes with his hand and looked into the sun he put the suitcase on the ground and checked his watch why dont you think about jonah i asked answer that why dont you think about your own son i am he said thats exactly what im doing thinking about jonah matter of fact he started me to thinking i aint never mentioned it before but the boys been worrying me one day we was downtown here and he asked me something that hurt daddy he said how come you aint a man i got mad i did and told him i am a man he said that wasnt what he meant i mean he said how come you aint a man where white folks concerned i couldnt answer him booker ill never forget it till the day i die i couldnt answer my own son and i been preaching forty years he dont know nothing bout it i said hes hotheaded like my boy hell find out when he grows up i hopes not aaron said shaking his head i hopes not some white folks passed and we shut up till they were out of hearing aaron who was acting real strange looked up in the sky and moved his lips he came back to himself after a little bit and he said this thing of being a man booker is a big thing the supreme court cant make you a man the naacp cant do it god almighty can do a lot but even he cant do it aint nobody can do it but you he said that like he was preaching and when he got through he was all filled up with emotion and he seemed kind of ashamedhe was a man who didnt like emotion outside the church he looked at his watch picked up his bag and said well lets git it over with we turned into elm and the first thing i saw at the end of the street was the train station it was an old red building flat like a slab a group of white men were fooling around in front of the door i couldnt make them out from that distance but i could tell they werent the kind of white folks to be fooling around with we walked on passing the dry goods store the barber shop and the new building that was going up across the street from that was the sheriffs office i looked in the window and saw bull sampson sitting at his desk his feet propped up on a chair a fat brown cigar sticking out of his mouth a ball about the size of a sweet potato started burning in my stomach please aaron i said please you cant get away with it i know how you feel sometimes i feel the same way myself but i wouldnt risk my neck to do nothing for hese niggers they wont appreciate it theyll laugh at you we were almost to the station and i could make out the faces of the men sitting on the benches one of them must have been telling a joke he finished and the group broke out laughing i whispered to aaron im through with it i wash my hands of the whole mess i dont know whether he heard me or not he turned to the right without saying a word and went on in the front door the stringbeany man who told the joke was so shocked that his cigarette fell out of his mouth yall see that he said why ill shut up another man said go git bull i kept walking fast turned at the corner and ran around to the colored waiting room when i got in there i looked through the ticket window and saw aaron standing in front of the clerk aaron stood there for a minute or more but the clerk didnt see him and that took some not seeing in that room aaron lott stood out like a pig in a chicken coop there were id say about ten or fifteen people in there but didnt none of them move they just sat there with their eyes glued on aarons back aaron cleared his throat the clerk didnt look up he got real busy with some papers aaron cleared his throat again and opened his mouth to speak the screen door of the waiting room opened and clattered shut it got real quiet in that room hospital quiet it got so quiet i could hear my own heart beating now aaron knew who opened that door but he didnt bat an eyelid he turned around real slow and faced high sheriff sampson the baddest man in south mississippi mr sampson stood there with his legs wide open like the men you see on television his beefy face was bloodred and his gray eyes were rattlesnake hard he was mad no doubt about it i had never seen him so mad preacher he said you done gone crazy he was talking lowlike and mean nosir aaron said nosir mr sampson what you think you doing going to st louis mr sampson you must done lost yo mind boy mr sampson started walking towards aaron with his hand on his gun twenty or thirty men pushed through the front door and fanned out over the room mr sampson stopped about two paces from aaron and looked him up and down that look had paralyzed hundreds of niggers but it didnt faze aaron nonehe stood his ground im gonna give you a chance preacher git on over to the nigger side and git quick i aint bothering nobody mr sampson somebody in the crowd yelled dont reason wit the nigger bull hit em mr sampson walked up to aaron and grabbed him in the collar and throwed him up against the ticket counter he pulled out his gun did you hear me deacon i said git im going to st louis mr sampson thats cross state lines the court done said aaron didnt have a chance the blow came from nowhere laying there on the floor with blood spurting from his mouth aaron looked up at mr sampson and he did another crazy thing he grinned bull sampson jumped up in the air and came down on aaron with all his two hundred pounds it made a crunchy sound he jumped again and the mob maddened by the blood and heat moved in to help him they fell on aaron like mad dogs they beat him with chairs they beat him with sticks they beat him with guns till this day i dont know what come over me the first thing i know i was running and then i was standing in the middle of the white waiting room mr sampson was the first to see me he backed off cocked his pistol and said booker boy you come one mo step and ill kill you whats a matter with you niggers today all yall gone crazy please dont kill him i begged you aint got no call to treat him like that so you saw it all did you well then booker you musta saw the nigger preacher reach for my gun he didnt do that mr sampson i said he didnt mr sampson put a big hairy hand on my tie and pulled me to him booker he said sweetly you saw the nigger preacher reach for my gun didnt you i didnt open my mouthi couldnt i was so scaredbut i guess my eyes answered for me whatever mr sampson saw there musta convinced him cause he throwed me on the floor besides aaron git this nigger out of here he said and be quick about it dropping to my knees i put my hand on aarons chest i didnt feel nothing i felt his wrist i didnt feel nothing i got up and looked at them white folks with tears in my eyes i looked at the women sitting crying on the benches i looked at the men i looked at mr sampson i said he was a good man mr sampson said move the nigger a big sigh came out of me and i wrung my hands mr sampson said move the nigger he grabbed my tie and twisted it but i didnt feel nothing my eyes were glued to his hands there was blood under the fingernails and the fingersthey looked like fat little red sausages i screamed and mr sampson flung me down on the floor he said move the nigger i picked aaron up and fixed his body over my shoulder and carried him outside i sent for one of my boys and we dressed him up and put him away real nicelike and rachel and the boy came and they cried and carried on and yet somehow they seemed prouder of aaron than ever before and the colored folksthey seemed proud too crazy niggers didnt they know couldnt they see it hadnt done no good in fact things got worse the northern newspapers started kicking up a stink and mr rivers the solicitor announced they were going to hold a hearing all of a sudden booker taliaferro brown became the biggest man in that town my phone rang day and night i got threats i got promises and i was offered bribes everywhere i turned somebody was waiting to ask me whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna say to tell the truth i didnt know myself one day i would decide one thing and the next day would decide another it was mr rivers and mr sampson who called my attention to that they came to my office one day and called me a shifty nogood nigger they said they expected me to stand by my statement in the train station that i saw aaron reach for the gun i hadnt said no such thing but mr sampson said i said it and he said he had witnesses who heard me say it and if you say anything else he said i cant be responsible for your health now you knowhe put that bloody hand on my shoulder and he smiled his sweet death smileyou know i wouldnt threaten you but the boyshe shook his headthe boys are real worked up over this one it was long about then that i began to hate aaron lott im ashamed to admit it now but its true i hated him he had lived his life he had made his choice why should he live my life too and make me choose it wasnt fair it wasnt right it wasnt christian what made me so mad was the fact that nothing i said would help aaron he was dead and it wouldnt help one whit for me to say that he didnt reach for that gun i tried to explain that to rachel when she came to my office moaning and crying the night before the hearing listen to me woman i said listen aaron was a good man he lived a good life he did a lot of good things but hes dead dead dead nothing i say will bring him back bull sampsons got ten niggers who are going to swear on a stack of bibles that they saw aaron reach for that gun it wont do me or you or aaron no good for me to swear otherwise what did i say that for that woman liked to had a fit she got down on her knees and she begged me to go with aaron go wit him she cried booker booker if yous a man if yous a father if yous a friend go wit aaron that woman tore my heart up i aint never heard nobody beg like that please woman please i said please dont carry on like that tell the truth booker she said thats all im asking tell the truth truth i said hah thats all you niggers talk about truth what do you know about truth truth is eating good and sleeping good truth is living rachel be loyal to the living rachel backed off from me you would have thought that i had cursed her or something she didnt say nothing she just stood there pressed against the door she stood there saying nothing for so long that my nerves snapped say something i begged say somethinganything she shook her head slowly at first and then her head started moving like it wasnt attached to her body it went back and forth back and forth back and forth i started towards her but she jerked open the door and ran out into the night screaming that did it i ran across the room to the filing cabinet opened the bottom drawer and took out a dusty bottle of scotch i started drinking but the more i drank the soberer i got i guess i fell asleep cause i dreamed i buried rachel and that everything went along fine until she jumped out of the casket and started screaming i came awake with a start and knocked over the bottle i reached for a rag and my hand stopped in midair of course i said out loud and slammed my fist down on the scotchsoaked papers i didnt see nothing why didnt i think of it before i didnt see nothing jumping up i walked to and fro in the office would it work i rehearsed it in my mind all i could see was aarons back i dont know whether he reached for the gun or not all i know is that for some reason the men beat him to death rehearsing the thing in my mind i felt a great weight slip off my shoulders i did a little jig in the middle of the floor and went upstairs to my bed whistling sarah turned over and looked me up and down what you happy about cant a man be happy i asked she sniffed the air oh she said and pressed her lips together she turned over and mumbled something in her pillow it came to me then for the first time that she was bout the only person in town who hadnt asked me what i was going to do i thought about it for a little while shrugged and fell into bed with all my clothes on when i woke up the next morning i had a terrible headache and my tongue was a piece of sandpaper for a long while i couldnt figure out what i was doing laying there with all my clothes on then it came to me this was the big day i put on my black silk suit the one i wore for big funerals and went downstairs to breakfast i walked into the dining room without looking and bumped into russell the last person in the world i wanted to see he was my only child but he didnt act like it he was always finding fault he didnt like the way i talked to negroes he didnt like the way i talked to white folks he didnt like this he didnt like that and to top it off the young whippersnapper wanted to be an artist undertaking wasnt good enough for him he wanted to paint pictures i sat down and grunted good morning papa he said it like he meant it he wants something i thought looking him over closely noticing that his right eye was swollen you been fighting again boy yes papa you younguns education thats what it is education its ruining you he didnt say nothing he just sat there looking down when i looked up and looking up when i looked down this went on through the grits and the eggs and the second cup of coffee whatcha looking at i asked nothing papa whatcha thinking nothing papa you lying boy its written all over your face he didnt say nothing i dismissed him with a wave of my hand picked up the paper and turned to the sports page what are you going to do papa the question caught me unawares i know now that i was expecting it that i wanted him to ask it but he put it so bluntly that i was flabbergasted i pretended i didnt understand do bout what boy speak up about the trial papa i didnt say nothing for a long time there wasnt much in fact i could say so i got mad questions questions questions i shouted thats all i get in this housequestions you never have a civil word for your pa i go out of here and work my tail off and you keep yourself shut up in that room of yours looking at them fool books and now soon as your old man gets his back against the wall you join the pack i expected better than that of you boy a son ought to back his pa that hurt him he picked up the coffee pot and poured himself another cup of coffee and his hand trembled he took a sip and watched me over the rim they say you are going to chicken out papa chicken out what that mean theyre betting youll tom i leaned back in the chair and took a sip of coffee so theyre betting huh the idea appealed to me crazy niggerstheyd bet on a funeral i saw pain on his face he sighed and said i bet too papa the cup fell out of my hand and broke spilling black water over the tablecloth you did what i bet you wouldnt tom you little fool i fell out laughing and then i stopped suddenly and looked at him closely how much you bet one hundred dollars i stood up youre lying i said whered you get that kind of money from mamma sarah i shouted sarah you get in here what kind of house you running sneaking behind my back giving this boy money to gamble with sarah leaned against the door jamb she was in her hot iron mood there was no expression on her face and her eyes were hard i gave it to him booker she said they called you an uncle tom he got in a fight about it he wanted to bet on you booker he believes in you suddenly i felt old and used up i pulled a chair to me and sat down please i said waving my hand please go away leave me alone please i sat there for maybe ten or fiften minutes thinking praying the phone rang it was mr withers the president of the bank i had put in for a loan and it had been turned down but mr withers said thered been a mistake new fellow you know he said clucking his tongue he said he knew that it was my lifelong dream to build a modern funeral home and to buy a cadillac hearse he said he sympathized with that dream supported it thought the town needed it and thought i deserved it the loan will go through he said drop by and see me this morning after the hearing when i put that phone down it was wet with sweat i couldnt turn that new funeral home down and mr withers knew it my father had raised me on that dream and before he died he made me swear on a bible that i would make it good and here it was on a platter just for a word a word that wouldnt hurt nobody but what about russell hed understand hed have to understand five or ten years from now i told myself he will have forgotten that it ever happened i put on my hat and hurried to the courthouse i was in a hurry to get it over with when they called my name i walked in with my head held high the courtroom was packed the white folks had all the seats and the colored folks were standing in the rear whoever arranged the seating had set aside the first two rows for white men they were sitting almost on top of each other looking mean and uncomfortable in their best white shirts i walked up to the bench and swore on the bible and took a seat mr rivers gave me a little smile and waited for me to get myself set state your name he said booker taliaferro brown i took a quick look at the first two rows and recognized at least ten of the men who killed aaron and your age fiftyseven youre an undertaker yessir you been living in this town all your life yessir you like it here dont you booker was this a threat i looked mr rivers in the face for the first time he smiled i told the truth i said yessir now calling your attention to the day of may th did anything unusual happen on that day the question threw me i shook my head then it dawned on me he was talking about yessir i said thats the day aaron got something in mr rivers face warned me and i pulled up thats the day of the trouble at the train station mr rivers smiled he looked like a trainer whod just put a monkey through a new trick you could feel the confidence and the contempt oozing out of him i looked at his prissy little mustache and his smiling lips and i got mad lifting my head a little bit i looked him full in the eyes i held the eyes for a moment and i tried to tell the man behind the eyes that i was a man like him and that he didnt have no right to be using me and laughing about it but he didnt get the message the bastardhe chuckled softly turned his back to me and faced the audience i believe you were with the preacher that day the water was getting deep i scroonched down in my seat closed the lids of my eyes and looked dense yessir mr rivers i drawled ah was ah was now booker he turned around i believe you tried to keep the nigger preacher from getting out of line i hesitated it wasnt a fair question finally i said yessir you begged him not to go in the white side yessir and when that failed you went over to your sidethe colored side and looked through the window yessir he put his hand in his coat pocket and studied my face you saw everything didnt you just about a muscle on the inside of my thigh started tingling mr rivers shuffled some papers he had in his hand he seemed to be thinking real hard i pushed myself against the back of the chair mr rivers pounced he moved close quick and stabbed his finger into my chest booker did you see the nigger preacher reach for mr sampsons gun he backed away smiling i looked away from him and i felt my heart trying to tear out of my skin i looked out over the courtroom it was still wasnt even a fly moving i looked at the white folks in front and the colored folks in back and i turned the question over in my mind while i was doing that waiting taking my time i noticed out of the corner of my eye that the smile on mr rivers face was dying away suddenly i had a terrible itch to know what that smile would turn into i said nosir mr rivers stumbled backwards like he had been shot old judge sloan took off his glasses and pushed his head out over the bench the whole courtroom seemed to be leaning in to me and i saw aarons widow leaning back with her eyes closed and it seemed to me at that distance that her lips were moving in prayer mr rivers was the first to recover he put his smile back on and he acted like my answer was in the script you mean he said that you didnt see it it happened so quickly that you missed it i looked at the bait and i ain t gonna lie i was tempted he knew as well as i did what i meant but he was gambling on my weakness i had thrown away my funeral home my hearse everything i owned and he was standing there like a magician pulling them out of a hat one at a time dangling them saying looka here looka here dont they look pretty i was on top of a house and he was betting that if he gave me a ladder i would come down he was wrong but you cant fault him for trying he hadnt never met no nigger who would go all the way i looked him in the eye and went the last mile aaron didnt reach for that gun i said them people they just fell on hold it he shouted i want to remind you that there are laws in this state against perjury you can go to jail for five years for what you just said now know youve been conferring with those naacp fellows but i want to remind you of the statements you made to sheriff sampson and me judge he dismissed me with a wave of his hand judge this man he caught himself and it was my turn to smilethis boy is lying ten niggers have testified that tney saw the preacher reach for the gun twenty white people saw it youve heard their testimony i want to withdraw this witness and i want to reserve the right to file perjury charges against him judge sloan nodded he pushed his bottom lip over his top one you can step down he said i want to warn you that perjury is a very grave offense you judge i didnt nigger he banged his gavel dont you interrupt me now git out of here two guards pushed me outside and waved away the reporters billy giles mr sampsons assistant came out and told me mr sampson wanted me out of town before sundown and he says youd better get out before the northern reporters leave he wont be responsible for your safety after that i nodded and went on down the stairs and started out the door booker rachel and a whole line of negroes were running down the stairs i stepped outside and waited for them rachel ran up and throwed her arms around me it dont take but one booker she said it dont take but one somebody else said they whitewashed it they whitewashed it but you spoiled it for em russell came out then and stood over to the side while the others crowded around to shake my hands then the others sensed that he was waiting and they made a little aisle he walked up to me kind of slowlike and he said thank you sir that was the first time ic his whole years that that boy had said sir to me i cleared my throat and when i opened my eyes sarah was standing beside me she didnt say nothing she just put her hand in mine and stood there it was long about then i guess when i realized that i was seeing so good hey say i cried but i dont believe a word of it it was such a hot day and the sun was shining so bright that the sweat rolling down my face blinded me i wiped the sweat out of my eyes and some more people came up and said a lot of foolish things about me showing the white folks and following in aarons footsteps i wasnt doing no such fool thing ol man rivers just put the thing to me in a way it hadnt been put beforeman to man it was simple really any man would have done it conakry by hoyt w fuller had been in the i republic of guinea r more than a week be fore i decided to do u u something about a haircut not that my hair had grown so much in that brief span of time it had taken ten days by ocean liner to reach conakry from palma de mallorca and my last visit to the barbers had been a week prior to sailing which meant i was overdue by approximately two weeks for my customary fortnightly trimming in africa it was easy to forget that i needed a haircut african men products of cultures which assign no stigma of inferiority to the texture of their hair find no virtue in cropping it close so thatas is the case with negroes in america it can be brushed or pressed straight with oil or pomade and since most of the local citizens wore their hair long i did not feel overly conscious of the thickening of my hair as i would have in amer ica but i had not forgotten the need entirely for lifelong habits are not so easily abandoned as all that and it was probably natural that i should have found aliounes haircut distracting it was a real airconditioned job perfect for the muggy heat rather thick on top but thin at the sides and rear and among the shaggythatched africans thronging the cramped drinking place it was eyecatching the haircuts wearer was no less arresting than his coiffure he was tall and broadshouldered with full molded features and deepset eyes that gave his handsome face a saturnine air he seemed aloof insofar as that was physically possible standing away from the counter near the wall i saw that the beer in his hand was not the local brew favoredprobably because of its lower priceby most people in the place and i concluded that he was an economic cut above his fellows i was chatting with the proprietor a fat sealmoist frenchman whose disaffection for america and things american bordered on the obsessive on the first evening i here as vhrecheeintent pjy he was wandered into his place seeking some congenial spot where ordinary guineans congregated he shook his heacmhffioaned dark i ows i w k t ly the ame if i represent ion of some on driving him in the midst oiisiippitarangue against barbaric america when he realized that my attention had shifted to the african ah that is alioune he said a fine fellow we are good friends he comes here to talk with me called the african and when the man had made his way to the counter announced rather ambiguously alioune this gentleman is an american alioune shook hands but said nothing only stared into my face when as a means of ending the unseemly silence i asked of his health he merely replies va bien msieur and continued to stare i suppose that i expected him to ask the usual questionswhy was i in guinea what did i think of it how long would i remain but if he was curious he did not indicate it i was drinking a large bottle of perrier as i always did on my visits to the tavernas i shall call it for the establishment eluded classification if was a sort of combination bartavern and general store a place so unpretentious that it had no name and needed none its facade resembled the rather desolate saloons in hollywood western movies and the interior even less impressive consisted of a huge room divided by a solid weathered counter with a third of the space reserved for customers who had to be served standing up there being no facilities for sitting the remainder of the room was incongruously mostly empty space surrounded by shelves holding a paltry selection of wines tinned foods such household items as soap and oil candy and other confections a doorway at the rear led to an invisible refrigerator where beverages were kept and to the living quarters of the proprietor and his sylphslender darkhaired and wistful wife apart from providing my daily quota of water replenishing that wrung from my pores by the sun the perrier gave me an excuse for calling at the tavern alioune regarded my bottle of water as a healthy man regards the medicines of a hypochondriac and invited me to have a beer thank you very much i said but i wont have any space left for beer after i finish this bottle why do you drink bottled water he asked somewhat suspiciously i explained that my system tended to react unpleasantly and sometimes violently to unaccustomed climates and water and that i felt the mineral water was wiser under the circumstances that explanation did not take into account the influence of many warnings of the dire consequences of drinking unboiled water in africa but it was substantially truthful the proprietor leaning over the counter shook his tousled dusty gray head and laughed he is so american he said to alioune the american black people are more american than the americans it was a marvelous statement loaded with terrible accusations against some eighteen million americans the most serious charge being that they lay claim to a heritage that is not their own it is an indictment bom of the fact of the alienation and degradation of american negroes but it fails to consider another fact that is at least as inescapablethat whether happily or regrettably it is as impossible to separate negroes from the complex entity that is america as it is to isolate the yeast from bread but it was easy to overlook these misconceptions in a foreigner when they are shared by so many americans who have no excuse for not knowing better but the implication that there was something uniquely indicative in an americans drinking a beverage that is bottled and widely sold in france and her dependent territories was frankly puzzling i said so ah you americans are so antiseptic the frenchman declared you are like women afraid of a few germs the frenchman was grinding an ax and it was useless to expect reason from him so i left his remark unchallenged when he moved off to attend to business i told alioune that i liked his haircut and asked if he would tell me where he had gotten it alioune regarded me speculatively the african barbershop is not very modern he said after a moment perhaps you would prefer a european barbershop not particularly i replied with some surprise i thought i would like a haircut similar to yours he nodded neutrally the barbershop is near the gare de voitures behind the hotel monkarin i said i had not the slightest idea where that was and he nodded again if you are free now i will show you we called out goodbye to the frenchman and maneuvered through the sweatscented mob to the door alioune led the way up the dusty street making no effort to converse answering my questions with elaborate economy of words near the boulevard du niger he pointed to a shop sandwiched between a jewelers and a bootmakers a sign reading coiffeur pour messieurs over the door perhaps you want this european shop msieur it is said that american black men do not prefer the society of africans you will be more comfortable here i would like to see your shop if you dont mind i persisted i refrained from asserting that i had traveled thousands of miles to seek the society of africans we continued past the hotel du niger across the tip of the aromatic market now almost deserted in the approaching dusk and down a wide street flanked on one side by the rear wall of the massive market building and on the other by a series of clothing shops these shops owned by middle easterners all seemed to be stocked with duplicate merchandise they featured during business hours small platoons of african men who sat out front at desks or behind machines sewing on the spot the garments sold inside their productstrousers shirts and blue and white moslem bouboushung from racks beneath the porticoes at the end of the street situated in a tiny plaza stood the threestory hotel monkarin a dusty ochrecolored building reminiscent of a chicago flophouse behind it was the gare du voitures an openair garage and service station attended by idle dandies and garrulous motorcar afficionados alioune said nothing until we crossed the street behind the hotel and stood on the edge of the premises of the gare de voitures it is here he said then indicating a structure directly in front of us he had turned so that he was looking squarely in my face measuring my reaction my attempt at suppressing my disappointment was hardly successful i had not expected an establishment that compared with the european barbershop but i was unprepared for what i saw the building could be charitably described as a leanto about half the size of a onecar garage through the open door most of the interior was visible a long shelf along the rear wall held several pieces of mirror and a variety of powders lotions combs and brushes the shelf as well as the floor was covered with dust of at least several days accumulation and hair layered the floor like a ragged carpet there were three chairs each presently occupied and three busy barbers and several men sat on benches in the corners awaiting their turns alioune gestured for me to enter and i stepped inside momentarily forgetting my own six feet plus and striking my head against the low ceiling as a consequence alioune spoke to the center barber apparently the manager and he stopped work to greet us this is an american gentleman alioune presented me he would like a haircut all faces turned to regard me i straightened slightly from my stooped stance trying to appear less ridiculous than i felt the barber saluted me politely told me he would personally cut my hair and asked that i take a seat on the bench and wait a few moments i told him that i had not the time for a haircut as it was growing late and that i would return the following day it was a lame excuse and i had a mental picture of aliounes nod of satisfaction behind my back very well msieur the barber said how much is a haircut i asked one hundred and fifty francs msieur i thanked the barber and stepped outside again there alioune and i shook hands exchanged formal pleasantries and went off in opposite directions the smug expression never left his face i did not meet alioune in the tavern again until two evenings later in the meantime i continued the practice of dropping in for a perrier morning and evening during the day the proprietor worked as building contractor in the surrounding area and madame ran the business with the help of a boy who sold ice from the shed adjoining the tavern many customers were women and children some of whom spoke little or virtually no french one of these was a morosefaced girl of eight or nine a bean pole of a child who regularly sauntered in bearing on her head a basket of roundedup bottles for which she insisted on being paid as she plumped them one at a time on the counter when as often happened madame refused to accept a bottle explaining that it had not come from her place the child flew into a tantrum flinging her thin arms and stamping her bare feet and screaming in soussou invariably the tantrum ran its futile course and she retired to a corner to nurse her unsalable bottles fondle her precious francs and sulk madame was as patient as a schoolmarm with difficult customers sometimes almost affectionately so there was a pair of winos who particularly drew her sympathy the men never seemed to work and yet they always had the price of some measure of a bottle of wine madame bantered amiably with them for as long as they were lucid and continued to indulge them when they no longer were the older man a moonfaced softeyed toma whoin his youth had traveled to serra leone and liberia spoke some english and offered to be my guide an offer he was in no condition to fulfill he never eats madame said of him rather like a fond but despairing mother he gets his only nourishment from wine the younger man a cocoacolored mulatto with wavy black hair and a face like a battered matinee idol affected imperious airs as a rule he spoke only to madame and when she was busy elsewhere talked to himself in a deeply modulated tone and in impeccable french toward evening the taverns limited space for customers swelled with workers having a quick beer on the way home or others already spruced up and out on the town it was a masculine assemblage but women occasionally infiltrated it a familiar female interloper was a tall silent soussou woman who appeared for a nightly beer with her baby laced to her back she never talked but stood apart at the wall and leisurely drank her beer there were however visits from less retiring ladies one of the least reticent was a middleaged north african woman a great partisan of wine who liked to regale prospective clients with tales of her sexual prowess her favorite fable involving no less a personage than the president of the republic he chose me she boasted brandishm ing her wine bottle at me and contorting her tattooed face in a yellowtoothed grimace intended to be seductive me the arab sekou toure came to my house i have proof i still have the thousandfranc note he gave me the proprietor usually arrived with the first surge of workers and leaving his helpers to unload the truck in front of the tavern joined madame behind the counter wet and soiled with sweat and grime he wore on these occasions a blue demin work shirt unbuttoned and khaki shorts over which his white belly hung and under which dropped gross legs unsightly with bluish lumps and varicose veins he scurried about between the counter and the refrigerator in the rear distributing cold beer collapsing winded on the counter during a lull in the rush of business he was in such an exhausted state gasping for breath but already launched in a denunciation of the moneygrasping americans when alioune came in relieved i welcomed the african with perhaps exaggerated warmth a warmth to which he was not receptive he seemed in fact more taciturn than before when his glance kept rising to my head i realized why you did not get a haircut msieur he said at length i have been very busy i said not altogether untruthfully alioune nodded knowingly when the frenchman went to fetch his beer he said why do you not go to the white mans barbershop you will like that better that is not necessarily true i said braking my annoyance at his smugness my hair is like yours and the african will know how to cut it however this reply did not get at the root of the tension i added you astonish me alioune what you have been told about american negroes is a lot of nonsense we do not prefer white people to africans we are anxious to know africans there simply has not been very much opportunity in the past alioune allowed himself a wry smile butfor the momentsaid nothing more when the frenchman returned with his beer he motioned toward the shelves above the untidy gray head the magazine he said the proprietor said ah as if anticipation of some imminent delight reached up andextracted a dogeared copy of a popular american weekly from a shelf he gave the magazine to alioune who placed it on the counter before me it had lain folded and he passed his hand over the creased slick paper so that it would lie flat the page to which the magazine was opened was soiled suggesting that it had been handed about print the text of a serial story covered most of the page and there was a column of advertisements on one side and a twocolumn cartoon at the bottom alioune pointed to the cartoon i looked down at the cartoon it showed a group of the thicklipped grassskirted spearwielding africans hovering hungrily about a large spot in which two pithhelmeted white man were being cooked my first impulse was to laugh for it was an amusing cartoon but the inclination toward levity was checked by my consciousness of aliounes seriousness and by the sudden awareness of the insidious influence at work on him when i looked up again aliounes eyes flared with accusation we are not savages msieur he said in a calm voice that only accentuated his smoldering fury my glance shifted along with my thoughts from alioune to the frenchman he was there leaning on the counter beaming over aliounes shoulder like some rolypoly mephisto after breakfast the following morning i hurried off to the barbershop while courage was fresh i had been invited by m debaste chief of the conakry base of fria the multimilliondollar international aluminum mining combine to dine in the firms eighthfloor penthouse that night several government ministers were to be on hand and i thought it appropriate to make my appearance as decent as possible a haircut would serve that purpose even if it made no contribution toward placating alioune on entering the shack i saw that the cloak of dust of two days before had not been disturbed and that fresh nap had been added to the hair rug on the floor the manager was busy and assuming there could not be so much difference i took the vacant chair on his left it was presided over by a thin ferretfaced young man as bafflingly neat and starched as the barbershop was disorderly and dusty the barber proceeded to chat as barbers will but i said very little preferring that he give all his attention to his work he snipped away rapidly enough perhaps a shade too rapidly and i several times cautioned him against taking off too much hair oui oui msieur je comprends he assured me each time and went on snipping with abandon when finally he presented me the fragmented mirror to view the finished job i was appalled my head looked as if a brood of angry hens had been scratching about in it is it as msieur wished the barber asked solicitously the scissors poised i quickly answered that it would have to do i thought it inadvisable to risk having him attempt to repair it for he might worsen it nature would fill in the gaps in the next few days the barber dusted by head and neck with talcum and i climbed out of the chair the manager regarded me with sympathy how much i asked merely as routine the barber hedged glanced undereyed at the manager and replied sotto voce cinq cents francs how much i demanded raising my voice it was incredible that he would ask five hundred francs for the mess he had made of my hair cinq cents francs he repeated in a more subdued voice than before i turned to the manager and asked very loudly what did you tell me the other day was the price of a haircut one hundred and fifty francs msieur he said apologetically i gave the scissor manipulator the correct fee and hurried off to the hotel to wash my head reflecting en route on the tenuousness of the bonds of brotherhood it was several days later when i next encountered alioune the dinner at fria and an interview with president toure already behind me the haircut had not failed to entertain m debaste and his guests and even the president i had rather looked forward to confronting alioune with the barbers attempt to swindle me thinking this might demonstrate that his own people were as capable of unfraternal attitudes as he imagined mine were but first i did a models whirl so that he could view the haircut fore and aft well i got my hair cut at your shop i said it is not very good alioune replied did the proprietor serve you no i said he was busy but the one who performed this job asked five hundred francs for it what do you think of that he showed no surprise did you pay it of course not then do not blame him you have more money than he does it is only logical that he ask what he thinks you will pay the frenchman who had been listening found the whole exchange hilarious he broke into uproarious laughter that was i suspected more affected than genuine ah you see you do not understand how they think we know the africans we live with them you are a white american in black skin aliounes cavernous eyes were fixed on my face he smiled slightly slyly as if in agreement with what the frenchman said the ghetto game by dennis clark ne of the most notable factors affecting the movement of negroes and other people of color in the urban centers has been the persistence of residential belts and islands of vs e ethnic groups in the older neighborhoods these concentrated ethnic groups have greatly influenced opinion and expectations about minorities historically the immigrant foreignlanguage groups established the american form of the ghetto pattern in the large cities their segregation was partly forced but partly voluntary permitting exit for those who were amenable to assimilation with the general population these ethnic enclaves with their traditionally inferior living conditions were the matrix for later and larger negro segregation areas when the great negro migration to the cities began around world war i the ethnic groups were a very considerable portion of the urban population in the foreignbom represented of our population as late as the central cities had very considerable percentages of foreignborn population the foreignborn in some of the major cities and the nonwhite populations with which they were in juxtaposition were foreign born nonwhite new york chicago los angeles philadelphia detroit boston the proximity of nonwhites and the foreignborn when it did not yield an uneasy tolerance produced confused resentment and hostility the happy fourth of july picture of hearty cocitizenship among all groups is misleading while a practical tolerance usually functions the attitudes and opinions underlying it are crude and well laced with antagonism although many immigrants have relaxed racial feelings others have for years replenished the ranks of the raceconscious immigrants from the old world were no doubt tutored in the fine points of racial distinction by the native americans those with foreignborn ties were usually no less susceptible to prejudice and racial antagonism than the nativeborn citizens of long standing their concentration in ethnic pockets gave ample social expression to their willingness to reject intrusion and adhere to group loyalties these groups became key factors in shaping the course of negro movement through urban residential areas in many places they rebuffed nonwhite entry into their areas or deflected it to other neighborhoods at times they formed walls of resistance to nonwhite movement or became swift evaders of nonwhite infiltration by moving away in concerted and disciplined fashion the ethnic communities of the large cities have constituted an obstacle course through which the nonwhites have had to move now displacing now surrounding now outflanking the immigrant islands and foreignlanguage concentrations obstacle course the primary consideration of the relationship of foreignlanguage communities to nonwhite population is that the immigrant neighborhoods have usually been physically contiguous or in opposition to nonwhite concentrations the negro and the foreignlanguage immigrant shared the limitations of income that forced them both to accept the older housing in the areas close to the center of the city for the negro this condition was more enduring he remained confined often while a succession of foreignborn groups came and went through the old neighborhoods this physical proximity is important it meant that the two types of minority groups racial and lingual were often in competition for the same shabby tenements and backstreet houses the foreignborn groups were often accustomed from their european background to working within circumscribed physical conditions their diligence and ingenuity would be lavished upon tiny areas that however poor they seemed by general american standards still represented relative comfort and security for the immigrant as the foreignbom groups thinned out they tended to shrink their concentrations or yield territory to others growing negro population often filled the abandoned irish italian or slavic areas but in order for the negro to gain access to the general channels of urban movement he frequently had to overcome or somehow bypass a traditionrooted core of immigrant residence these immigrant communities served as barriers against negro mobility for the rest of the city population examples of such roadblocks to negro movements could be seen in st louis around where germans jews poles and italians bordered the negro district west of the mississippi the polish principality of hamtramck in detroit has for years been impenetrable by negroes the ethnic ghettos along franklin street in north philadelphia have long prevented the eastward movement of negroes the physical confrontation of the negro and the white minority groups has been fraught with social factors that bedevilled the relationship the foreignborn were often not sure of themselves at all in their new urban environment many were unused to democracy and its concepts of social and racial equality upon achieving some status in this new country they felt they could not afford to have it undermined by mixing with the stigmatized nonwhite group although at times sensitive to discrimination themselves they were in too precarious a social position to let this permit a softening in their own attitude toward the nonwhites the foreignbom groups were beset with many internal conflicts and it was an easy response to direct hostility against the nonwhites the social conflicts and tensions accompanying the process of adjustment of the foreignbom to urban life tended to produce crime and delinquency which sometimes became a behavior pattern within the groups this turbulence became exceedingly dangerous when radical incidents took place to the tightly knit foreignbom groups the negro was often a strange and dreadful creature they would have less knowledge of him than even the native white american he would not be another european like the rest of the minorities he would not have the elaborate rituals and customs of the europeans but would seem to defy any cultural definition as a competitor for jobs space and facilities he was a threat it is evident then that among the group antagonisms in american cities the relationship between the negro and the foreignborn presented special difficulties but this is all in the past it was acted out in the early part of the century some would say this is too facile a judgment the foreignbom communities have been tenacious some have thrived for generations in addition to the foreignborn persons in these groups the second and thirdgeneration offspring are often strongly identified with ethnic ties the information that follows should be in no way construed as indicative of any thoroughgoing social malady in the groups discussed these groups all have remarkable qualities and have made remarkable contributions to american life their difficulties with the racial question though more severe or more immediate because of their physical proximity to negrooccupied areas are part of the more general vexation of our society on this issue we will look then at some of the groups whose position in the urban demographic pattern exposes them to the test of tolerance on race relations the poles people with race relations experienced contend that polish neighborhoods are particularly resistant to racial change and are likely to react violently to incursions by nonwhites areas of polish immigrant or other slavic concentration have been the scenes of some of the most notable outbursts ot racial violence in northern cities violence in detroit is often ascribed to polish elements as were outbreaks in cicero illinois adjacent to chicago the poles are noted as a highly individualistic people a people caught in historic contradictions the history of the mother country may be very significant in explaining the polish attitude toward group relationships in this country polands shifting borders and political life have embraced a number of traditionally hostile ethnic and nationality groups within poland there have been in modern times a variety of populations coexisting in uneasy polity lithuanians estonians germanspeaking elements ukrainians white russians jews and various balkan strains have lived in polish territory intermittently the poles have had a difficult time to look at it from their viewpoint with a long historical succession of fiery separatist unyielding foreignlanguage and ethnic minorities this accounts for some of the furious quality of polish nationalism with such a legacy of intergroup difficulty it is not surprising that poles did not come to the polyglot american city with a bland attitude toward minority neighbors in the new world in the great monument of research on the poles the polish peasant in europe and america thomas and znaniecki point out a distinctive feature of polish immigrant life they note that the poles formed their mutual aid societies and social and fraternal groups before they concentrated residentially this is important it means that there was an especially deliberate character to polish residential concentration it did not take place in such a random fashion as that of other groups while it was no doubt subject to the general exigencies of immigrant settlement there was more consultation direction and group influence in the choices that formed the polish communities thus the polish neighborhood is less of an accident and more of a group bastion than the neighborhoods of most other immigrants moreover polish families usually devote a great deal of energy and thrift to the care of dwellings the house is a family project and all share in its improvement in such areas as detroits hamtramck which has stood as an allwhite area adjacent to negro concentrations for years the steady improvement of the housing is a tribute to the hard work of immigrant families the reaction of such families to the encroachment of negroes whose residential history has been one of privation is strongly resentful the rough caliber of this resentment is described by one commentator on big city life the poles who for the most part live in neighborhoods that have not yet been entered by negro families are said to be determined to resist with violence if necessary any negro invasion of the areas they inhabit political committeemen in polish neighborhoods have vocally associated themselves with this attitude as a minority group the poles have not fared as well in the american immigrant sweepstakes as others bogue points that the secondgeneration poles in the united states have actually a lower socioeconomic status than the first generation poles have also remained in a position near the bottom of the social distance scale a device drawn up by social scientists to reflect prevalent ethnic preferences in terms of educational attainment the poles rank low among immigrant groups in this country the jews and irish do well in increasing the level of school years completed between first and second generation italians and others complete fewer years in school these factors would certainly have an influence upon the race relations of the group deprivation of social status would heighten the likelihood that poles would feel a need for a scapegoat the negro would be present and often in a position to compete with the pole for jobs and other opportunities the lower educational achievement of the pole would increase the possibility of unthinking and pugnacious responses to racial change because the percentage of polishborn persons in the population will decrease rapidly in coming years and because residential mobility will continue to erode the old polishoccupied neighborhoods the acuteness of the racial problem with respect to this group is likely to diminish since the poles are a predominantly roman catholic group the gradual but pervasive catholic moral concern for the elimination of racial inequities will have an affect as the educational level of people of polish background rises the italians of all immigrant groups the italians are most symbolic for the twentieth century of the great american experience of immigration of the major immigration groups they were the last great wave to arrive from europe in the tens of thousands their arrival was the denouement of the tremendous atlantic migration they seemed to enact the drama of building an urban ethnic world in american cities with a zestful enthusiasm numerically the italianborn are our largest foreignborn group their concentrations in the little italys in the various cities are still very much with us the italian neighborhoods are some of our most striking examples of ethnic aggregation today if we omit negro neighborhoods from consideration the italian neighborhoods with their accompanying churches fraternal lodges italian food shops and gregarious family life have not been confined to older largecity areas many smaller industrial towns in the east fruitgrowing areas on the west coast and foodprocessing centers have strong italian communities we are most concerned however with the italianoccupied areas adjoining negro districts these older neighborhoods usually derived their italian character from the first waves of immigration from southern italy beginning in the s and reaching its height in the early years of this century the tide ebbed after world war i the exhaustion of the sicilian sulphur mines the demise of feudal estates with political change the great disaster of the blight of the grapevines and the hope for a better life in america brought tens of thousands of italians to our urban areas at times the immigrants were recruited for american industry by agents in italy employment was found in railroad construction the garment trades the building trades and food industries one striking feature of the italian residential blocks has been the housing improvements that have taken place under private initiative the extensive engagement of italians in building trades meant that the families usually had valuable skills available the men could cut stone lay brick and cement and do a great number of things by way of physical improvement of homes and shops and significantly they could do these things themselves well enough to be proud of the results owing to the association of negroes with shabby and deteriorated houses the financial and emotional investment of the italian householder was felt to be in jeopardy when negroes encroached also the italian neighborhood has been steadily replenished by secondand thirdgeneration offspring strong family ties induce a number of the younger families to stay within walking distance of parents and grand parents the beloved nona the winemaking grandfather the generous uncle or godparent are just too wellaccepted and compatible to desert large families in small houses mean that the young will seek the outdoors in cities this means the street comer or some familiar sandwich shop in the italian neighborhoods the pizza shops and the soda fountain hangouts are the scenes for second and thirdgeneration streetcorner society it is in the relations of juvenile groups that antagonism between negroes and white immigrant groups often flares up the case of italian youths will be cited here not because it is peculiar to them but because there are good examples of friction in italian neighborhoods in the case files of interracial and intergroup relations agencies a further complication to the racial issue may be a latin concept of personal honor which requires an injury to be avenged this would increase the possibility of hostile exchange in and early two cities provided examples of incidents involving italians and negroes the incidents were largely independent of one another but their combined impact on the respective italian and negro groups should be considered carefully because the outbreaks formed a clear sequence in popular opinion in philadelphia in may a high school boy john campigla was killed by a wolf pack attack of negro youths the killing was utterly senseless and the victim utterly innocent public opinion in the italian community was inflamed a series of small fights and a retaliatory shotgun attack took place shortly afterward in the same section of the city fortunately the shotgun blast only slightly injured a negro girl on the steps of a baptist church in june a young policeman named marinelli was called to a melee in a heavily negro area of north philadelphia he leaned from the door of his patrol wagon and fired his gun repeatedly at a fleeing man he killed not only the man but a woman near him both victims were negro both were innocent of any offense negro community opinion was outraged in february while the trial of the killers of john campiglia was in progress the son of a civic leader in south philadelphia named ianelli was beaten by a teenage gang of negroes the boys father had been a worker for better race relations in march a teenager named cerone was stabbed by negro boys after a basketball game the wound resulting in paralysis in the same month an emotionally disturbed italian warbride wife of a negro in an integrated community attracted public notice by placing antinegro signs around her home and engaging in other antinegro activity these incidents with the publicity attending them formed a pattern for the italian and negro groups their effect was to add fuel to smoldering hostility and to start a chainreaction of aggravating incidents which heightened the possibility of a general outbreak these incidents are typical of the violence that plagues the relationship between ethnic groups the events are usually given sensationalized coverage in the general press as well as being reported in the italian and spanishlanguage papers and the negro press people conscious of ethnic identity take sides connecting the incidents with a special kind of rivalry the chance of retaliation is increased by the proximity of the groups such series of events are common in the large cities the hostility thus generated may come to a head at any time to provide the tinder form thus generated may come to a head at any time to provide the tinder for largescale racial violence fortunately for blessed but obscure reasons it seldom does the jews jewish people are wise in the ways of cities they have for centuries been an urban people time after time they have seen racial antagonism mount in city streets it is improbable however that they have ever encountered on such a large scale the kind of problem presented by the urbanization of the american negro the entire social life of the modern city is momentously different from that of the past in the past population movement was slow today there is swift movement resulting in an almost random mixture of people from various backgrounds in metropolitan centers in this setting the large jewish populations of the major northern cities are involved in a very distinctive way in the nations struggle to resolve the american dilemma of race relations one of the places in which negroes confront jews is the corner store in many of the great segregated districts the last outposts of white residence are the groceries small drygoods stores and pharmacies which are in many cases owned and operated as family businesses by modestly prosperous jewish people because of their economic stake in these small businesses the owners have frequently been reluctant to leave areas which have changed racially in segregated neighborhoods where the earning power and standard of living are often depressed these little stores fit intimately into neighborhood life they are flexible enough to meet the irregular needs of informal local and family living in overcrowded negro districts the streetcorner society which affords an outlet to the young centers around such small businesses m in these circumstances the jewish storekeeper is often the only white man many negroes see on a regular basis he is a person who gives service but often he is also a family creditor to whom the grocery bill is owed the amount of antisemitism that may grow out of this latter relationship is surprising as the last white resident on the block in sections where existence is less than genteel it is understandable that small shopkeepers should at times feel the pressure of minoritygroup frustration and counterprejudice a second sphere of influence in which negroes and jews interact is in those heavily jewish neighborhoods that have begun to change racially the sequence of migrations of minority groups through our cities has often placed negroes next in line to jews in social status and homebuying ability neighborhoods once forbidden to jews have received substantial influxes of jewish home owners because of geographical convenience or economic accessibility these same neighborhoods are now attractive to nonwhite home buyers the aspiring negro sees in these areas the same virtues of middleclass respectability that jewish families fresh from the immigrant jewtowns saw in them a generation ago perhaps there is also some basis for supposing that the liberal opinion prominent in bigcity jewish circles and the traditionally nonviolent disposition of jews exert an attraction on negroes seeking a way out of segregated neighborhoods in neighborhoods where jews form a very substantial portion of the poulation there has been no marked deviation from the general pattern of response to negro newcomers essentially the white reaction remains the same the likelihood of violence is at a minimum but the development of panic and gradual white withdrawal is the usual course community leadership sympathetic toward racial integration does seem to be more frequent in such areas but this does not change the eventual outcome the promotion of interracial understanding still comes too little and too late to be of any practical significance there are other influences that seem to make neighborhoods with heavy jewish populations susceptible to racial turnover for many jewish families long in the urban tradition the processes of property exchange contain no mystery they enter without hesitation into real estate transactions when the question arises of leaving a changing neighborhood in addition in a group keenly preoccupied with education the coming of negroes to the public school seems in the light of racial stereotypes like a blow to the educational advantages and prospects of jewish children other factors permitting greater mobility are the small size of jewish families and the relatively high proportion of jews who live in apartments instead of owning houses in any event the middleclass status of the bulk of the jewish population usually assures some assets with which to negotiate a property sale the problem of a synagogue in a racially changing area should also be noted unlike many christian denominations the jews do not proselytize the synagogue congregation can not absorb incoming negro families the way a correctly oriented roman catholic or a congregational or methodist church can and reduction in the congregation due to the removal of a jewish family is likely to be permanent if a sufficient proportion of the congregation migrates it may be economically mandatory for the temple to follow this is one reason for the growth of the echo ghetto in the suburbs the old downtown congregation reforms in the new area the third sphere in which negroes and jews are particularly linked is not so much physical as it is one of social psychology the negro and jew are both members of a minority group that experienced a sour tolerance or actual illtreatment on the american scene this fact has brought forth a sort of kinship or practical affinity between jews and negroes based on their common concern for fair treatment and democratic rights hence jewish and negro organizations can usually be found working together for civil_rights fair employment intergroup understanding and racial integration many jewish groups devote more effort to bettering race relations than to any other object the american jew shares actively in the economic abundance that has been the nations harvest for the last fifteen years he walks with nonjews as leader organization man and laborer in the economic activities of the day he inhabits suburbia and plays a vigorous role both as producer and consumer the negro by contrast is just beginning to emerge from an economic limbo his family income job status savings and property ownership are all below the national average for whites and nobody really knows how much of the recent progress of negroes in these areas has been achieved at the expense of such sacrifices as the employment of mothers and the postponement of medical and educational needs in social organization we perceive once again a great disparity between jew and negro jews have an enviable apparatus of fraternal charitable and civic organizations manned by articulate and effective leaders negroes are still suffering from the paucity of leadership that has been a traditional characteristic of depressed ethnic groups arriving on the urban scene men like martin_luther_king are exceptional in any group the ability of a group to train and consistently present skilled leadership is slowgrowing leadership in effective force does not rise out of a vacuum it must have preconditions of education organized tradition a degree of leisure and concourse with the elites of power and learning an examination of the relationship between the negro and the jew in the light of the social factors mentioned above indicates that there is a considerable social gap between the two groups in spite of the bond of sympathy they share one of the practical effects of this situation is that jews are often placed under extreme pressures when they face up to racial issues often jewish people solidly supporting liberal race relations practices and programs feel genuinely repelled by the social differences persisting in the negro population when racial integration confronts them and they are brought face to face with the contrasts between the great bulk of the newly urbanized negro population and their own established middle class thus jews do seem to have a special problem with respect to racial change puerto ricans although puerto rican migration to the mainland has not brought about a great dispersion of spanishspeaking people generally through the eastern cities it has resulted in strong puertorican concentrations in the old neighborhoods of philadelphia chicago bridgeport and above all new york the influx has thus placed the puerto ricans in some of the major urban centers which are today vast laboratories of social tension and racial change placed beside american negroes or intermingled with them the puerto ricans have been very confused in their racial attitudes their hispanic background has endowed them with a rather casual attitude toward race this attitude is subtle in the mainland cities the keen consciousness of race among the general population forces puerto ricans to question their own tradition in racial matters and frequently to adopt a more decisive attitude towards racial differences in response to the mainland abberrations but this is done with much inner confusion racial distinctions in puerto rico are mild but they are there the spanish terms of el bianco white el indio dark skin with straight hair el grijo white coloring but with hair or features of a negroid cast el bien triguena a fairer negro and the use of the term el negro as a word of opprobrium reflect the differing values ascribed to racial visibility on the island within the puerto rican group however particularly in puerto rico color is inconsequential in social relations in families there will sometimes be a subtle feeling of status difference based on color between siblings but this is seldom serious on the mainland this attitude of casual acceptance can suddenly become starkly challenged and the emotional impact on family life and personal awareness can be tremendous the acute ingroup feeling and loyalty in the puerto rican communities induces the hispanos to reject the american negro on double grounds first as an outsider and second as a symbol of and a target for racial discrimination with which it would be unwise to be identified the spanishspeaking puerto rican of dark color is fraternally treated except perhaps on the mainland where there is question of intimate or permanent relationshipsbut the american negro is an interloper a threat a puzzle the fact that similar disabilities afflict both groups in many ways only heightens the puerto ricans resentment against the american negro thus puerto ricans may resent appeals against prejudice and discrimination which link american negroes and hispanos puerto ricans in new york and elsewhere have been harbingers of racial change in east harlem the bronx and brooklyn they have preceded negro entries having the puerto ricans in the role of precursors has not noticeably slowed the classic white response of withdrawal upon negro influx in the mainland cities the relations between american negroes and puerto ricans have commonly been strained with juvenile fights the most frequent expression of this antagonism the tension seems greatest with respect to newly arrived puerto ricans there is some moderation of hostility as the groups reside in the same area over a period of time small groups will become friends and establish ties casually in the second or third generation but the barrier to intimate association will usually remain there is the old area competition between the two groups for jobs and housing the negro resents the arrival of the puerto rican to work for lower pay puerto ricans who open small shops and stores accuse negroes of being stupid or lazy because they have in the main been slow to build such businesses any advances made by hispanos are subject to criticism by negroes because the puerto rican not born on the mainland and speaking a foreign language is successful at the expense of negroes while hispanos and negroes may resent one another their residential association is constantly enforced the puerto ricans are recently arrived in the cities and so are many southern negroes landlords are seldom capable of according the groups separate status although the language factor may make property rental more difficult for the hispanos the distinction and separation is made at the insistence of the puerto ricans who tend to choose dwellings removed from negro occupancy so far as this is possible in areas crowded by the adjacent groups perhaps the chief factor separating the two groups besides the consciousness of color is a difference in attitudes about sex and the family at the neighborhood level this is extremely important for the residential world is a domestic one the hispano family is extended proud and has a careful code of behavior and relationships prescribed by long tradition the negro family is nuclear weakened by many longterm influences and informal in its relationships in the puerto rican family the male has high status in the negro family the woman has so often been breadwinner that she is the main figure puerto ricans resent the easy approach to women that mainland negroes may exhibit for puerto ricans the woman is guarded by a protective supervision of attitudes and customs hence there is a subtle strategy of withdrawal among the spanishspeaking families which evades advances by american negroes even though life may be proceeding on a friendly basis the negro who may have encountered promiscuous contacts between puerto rican males and american negro women sees no reason why the compliment shouldnt be returned by puerto rican women especially since many may be just as dark as he is there are other divergences in churches and in recreation some commentators state that integration of the mainland negroes and puerto ricans is far away the two groups will continue to share the worst of the housing supply with the puerto rican frequently unable to escape identification with the negro although residential segregation of necessity will operate less precisely in the case of some spanishspeaking because they are not readily identifiable as colored the puerto rican will continue to be the alter ego of the mainland negro in residential matters the negro neighborhoods adjoining the white minority communities have an ambiguous set of attitudes toward their distant neighbors on the one hand the immigrants are subject to some discrimination as is the negro in some ways relationships may be casual and unprejudiced negroes may shop in the curbside italian markets or go to school with puerto ricans or realize that jewish organizations are prointegration on the other hand there will be a recognition that the immigrants do constitute a group by themselves with their own exclusive clubs and programs and the negro will know that acquiring a house in the immigrant area will mean trouble for the negro population the significance of the white immigrant as a member of a minority group tends to be obscured by the simple fact that the immigrant is white thereby sharing the negative characteristics of the stereotyped white person so common in the thinking of negroes it is frequently observed by native negroes with some bitterness that they are denied opportunities which the foreignborn can easily obtain the resettlement of hungarian refugees after the disorders in that country in aroused resentment in negro circles as they saw it persons who had made no contribution to this country were fussed over by the government and resettled in good houses in good neighborhoods negroes couldnt occupy those same houses without bringing the scorching wrath of their fellow citizens down on their heads on succeeding some immigrant population in an area negroes often find that the housing is owned by a number of absentee landlords of the previous immigrant group the negro families may face rent gouging and other forms of exploitation and their attitude toward the group represented by the landlords may become hostile the activities of immigrant savings and loan societies which control property or immigrant fraternal groups who purchase property to keep it out of the hands of negroes produce the same kind of negative reaction the muslim and black nationalist groups which have been widely publicized in recent years are not averse to singling out jews and other groups for special indictment in race relations these negro extremist cults do not represent any large segment of negro opinion but their arguments in this matter will usually be listened to with care by a great number of negroes who may be familiar with the racial thinking of white ethnic groups as the inquirer proceeds to the more educated levels of negro life however he finds that the commitment of negroes to tolerance and interracial fellowship offsets bad experiences the informed and intelligent negro seldoms singles out particular white ethnic groups for criticism in racial matters but tends to argue in terms of the white population as a whole native whites although we have concentrated our attention upon foreignborn groups in this chapter it should not be inferred that cohesive nativeborn neighborhoods are not a frequent source of trouble the problems arising from neighborhoods with a high percentage of appalachian mountaineers have been of considerable concern in some cities cities with a high homeownership rate where neighborhoods are stable and the population relatively settled produce the phenomenon of entrenched burghers with practically no immigrant ties who yet vigorously oppose racial change such areas are not nearly so troublesome as immigrant locales but they indicate that it is not so much immigrant peculiarities as the fundamental sense of group cohesion which threatens social harmony in racial situations the population elements deriving from the old immigration of the early nineteenth century have of course been deeply enmeshed in the traditions of racial exclusion and restriction whatever our estimate of the reactions of new immigrant groups we must not forget that these groups have been entering into an american stream of social opinion in which racism was a strong current the upperclass and middleclass neighborhoods of the succesful old immigration elements were the models for the newer arrivals there are forces at work in nativeborn neighborhoods that on occasion can produce agitated waves of racial feeling although such areas seldom hold the same violence potential as immigrant communities the insecurity of the junior executive suburb is an example in a suburb of organization man families the corporations that control the jobs of the breadwinners may transfer a household head to another city on short notice hence the home owners are extremely sensitive to anything which would make the selling of their houses more difficult the presence of negroes in the area is such a factor this junior executive difficulty was thought to be one of the reasons why the suburban town of deerfield illinois reacted with hostility to a plan to erect a limited number of attractive homes for interracial occupancy nearby another reaction in nativeborn old immigration areas in recent years has been the product of a decline into minority status on the part of formerly predominant groups oldline white protestant communities in large cities where the populations are increasingly catholic and negro are beginning to display all marks of minority psychology they feel hemmed in discriminated against objects of the illwill of the growing negro and catholic elements security and selfpossessed assurance are beginning to wane under the impact of metropolitan population mobility and changes in the urban power structure even though many of the oldline neighborhoods and suburbs are not yet confronted with racial change they have had to admit jews italians and a variety of other formerly proscribed groups having been nudged this far the oldline residents have begun to fear that the next step racial change is inevitable this is a reaction that is not found among the hardier new immigrants who are often ready to contest each street in their area the shifting population of the urban centers will alter the residential makeup in the central city areas only vestiges of the immigrant communities will remain for some years yet however these communities will have a special significance for race relations in most of the larger cities the municipal intergroup relations agencies have representation from the different ethnic groups on their boards or in staffs this at least permits some communication with the groups so that when conflict situations or severe tensions arise there can be consultation and the exertion of accepted leadership to avoid outbreaks or the continuation of hostility formal representation of ethnic groups on those civic bodies committed to peace and fair play increases the possibility that mutual respect will be maintained the leadership of each group is loath to be stigmatized as irresponsible or incendiary in the eyes of the other group such a formula for civic peace in the diversified urban community can be effective if it is well administered and serviced with an adequate program of information conference and involvement of representative opinion leaders but if the formula is mere windowdressing a coalition of ethnic leaders for mutual admiration and egogratification or for the sake of political display then the city that permits such a fraud may find its peace broken and its minority group relations poisoned by antagonism the day of immigrant neighborhoods may be fading fast but these areas have had a strategic significance in the last two decades in their effect upon nonwhite urban movement they represent a notable interlude in intergroup relations the lessons we can learn from them should not be readily forgotten a challenge to negro leaders by louis e lomax ime settles all disputes thus the social critics are separated from the vested interest leaders truth is separated from organizational propaganda in mid i published in harpers magazine an article the negro revolt against the negro leadership class that article led to my current book the negro revolt which is now in its fifth printing and also issued in paperback the thesis of both the article and the book is that as of the montgomery bus boycott the american negro has been in a state of revolt that the revolt is not only against segregation but against the entrenched negro leadership class as well my specific point was that legalism had taken the negro about as far as it could that from this point forward the negro would fight his main battles in the streets and in the market place i agreed with the militant students core and dr martin_luther_king that the law was clear that what was needed was for negroes to present their bodies as living sacrifices to implement the already stated court decisions as a necessary consequence of this position i was critical of those negro organizations specifically the naacpthat refused to make a clearcut committment to whatever kinds of demonstration were necessary to actualize the rights the courts have long since said we have for this i was drawn and quartered by certain national leaders i have in my files proof that one negro organization tried to stop certain publications from employing me i have letters from local naacp branch presidents saying they had been advised by the naacp national office that i was not to be allowed to speak before naacp meetings white liberal columnistsnotably harry golden and lawrence spevackcalled me an extremist and suggested that i smelled of malcolm_x in some instances the attack on me approached calumny the crisis article the revolt of louis e lomax reprinted in negro digest december was so invidious that i felt deep sorrow for the excellent and brilliant mind that had been given such an assignment but time settles all disputes and i held my rebuttal in the certain knowledge that moving events would speak for me or against me with my critics or against them and time spoke with a thunderclap at birmingham alabama i was there i ran with hundreds of negro children as they like jack rabbitsscampered from churches past fire hoses over policemen and by growling dogs into the center of birmingham where they staged one mighty rockandroll for freedom and dignity and when the tumult was done birmingham department stores had pledged themselves to desegregation of their facilities to upgrading of negro employees to the release of negro demonstrators and a biracial committee had been formed to watch over continuing racial progress in that tormented town reporting from birmingham time magazine said birminghams negroes were not worried about legalities they were not worried about the niceties of timing instead theirs was a raging desire to achieve equal human status now and by whatever means as any liberal well knows when time comes upon such a discovery the fact is at least three years old and it was edward brooke the attorney general of massachusetts and its first statewide negro official who underscored the point said brooke the pressure is mounting it has been smoldering for many years and it is a justifiable impatience birmingham is but the beginning the continuation actuallyfor at this writing nashville memphis chicago and albany georgia are belching racial flames demonstrators have already taken to the streets and the market places of these towns in allout efforts to gain what they deem to be their just freedoms philadelphians led on by core have just staged an all night sitin at city hall as a result the mayor has signed an order that will stop all city building until the unions involved hire and upgrade negroes so then the story goes but this is no hour for gloating as ambassador carl rowanthen a minnesota newsmansaid lomaxs the revolt against the negro leadership class raises the question that will plague leadership for the next decade or so and it is with this issue not for personalities involved that i wish to deal first of all the bickering among negro leaders and leadership organizations has reached such proportions that it could hamper racial progress the classic evidence of this is the story surrounding the birth of the voter education program that is now doing such magnificent work in the deep south while i was working on the tv documentary walk in my shoes i was given a news tip according to the tipster some quarter of a million dollars was available to underwrite a concentrated negro voter registration drive in the deep south provided the various negro leadership organizations could pull together and carry out the program each in its own way but with an umbrella of central guidance i checked out the story found it to be true and was able to isolate the taconic foundation as the fountain of funds i did not break the story my agent had a ready market for it because those in the know felt that a premature break of the story would endanger the entire project for the better part of two months i kept the story quiet but managed to stay abreast of developments things moved slowly but eventually i received irrefutable information that every negro leadership organization but the naacp had agreed to participate in the program from inside the naacp national board itself i received information that the program was in grave trouble there that the board had just decided to defer voting on the project until a future board meeting this is the way we handle hot potatoes the board member told me we never turn them down and open ourselves to criticism we simply keep setting them over to another meeting at about the same time i discovered that the holders of the purse strings were getting nervous they had about decided to withdraw the money if the naacp did not agree to work with the project after all a spokesman said to me we cant afford to launch such a drive without the cooperation of the largest best organized and best known negro leadership organization on the day this information fell into place i was scheduled to make a broadcast on radio station wbai in new york it was a freewheeling type program that allowed me fifteen minutes to say whatever i chose i elected to break the story as i have related it here i omitted the name of the organization that had so far refused to work with the voter project i concluded by asking whether a negro leadership organization had the moral right to refuse participation in such a program without a public explanation the result was electric innocent organizationsspecifically core were bombarded by memberdonors who demanded to know how such a large sum of money could be lost when theythe organizationswere constantly begging for funds the organizations replied we are not the guilty ones the mystery of the guilty organization was solved by the naacp itself whena few days laterit sent an emergency memorandum to all its branches in the new york area the memorandum castigated me for being an inaccurate sensationseeking reporter and then went on to say why the naacp had not agreed to the voter registration project witnm hours after that memo the naacp agreed to the project and the now famous voter education program was underway what was behind all this the naacp feltand rightly sothat it had been doing a good voter registration job in the south the power structure had qualms about joining a broad program where the naacp efforts would become less distinctive and identifiable from an organizational point of view the naacp leadership was absolutely correct joining the voter education program would certainly blur the specific contributions made by that organization from a negro point of view the naacp leadership was absolutely wrong for the purpose of the naacpor of all negro leadership organizations for that matteris not to perpetuate the organization but to free negroes from second class citizenship and when the bickering over who will get the credit and thus have a larger base for fund raising begins to cloud the sky of freedom then it is time that a warning be sounded secondly negro leadership is so sensitive to social criticism that it has resorted to tactics that border on censorship item in i was the associate producer of the awardwinning tv documentary walk in my shoes which was seen on the abc network several days before the show was aired abc officials received a letter from an naacp official on naacp stationery objecting to the airing of the program abc officials were astounded because we didnt know just how the documentary would shape up ourselves at that moment we were still in the final stages of editing and cutting abc contacted the official and asked how he could object to that which he had not seen that which we ourselves had not settled on he replied in essence that it didnt make any difference what was in the documentary as long as lomax has anything to do with it we object i hasten to add that the official involved was a national official but no one was more shocked than roy wilkins when he was apprised as to what one of his underlings had done item a similar situation occurred when i wrote the bitter cup a dramatic show that was seen on nbcs frontier of faith the naacp got wind of it demanded a screening got it and literally frightened network officials into making last minute changes item mrs tina sattin wife of singer lonnie sattin and program chairman of the mount vernon new york naacp branch called and asked me to speak for their membership rally on the morning of the rally mrs sattin called and with deep apology she had just the week before helped me with a telethon during which upwards of were raised for the freedom riders told me that gloster current naacp secretary for branches had issued an order that i not speak several hours of telephone wrangling ensued and the branch president mrs gerry johnson decided that i should speak anyway i addressed the rallyall of those present item during a recent lecture tour of california a white member of the santa monica naacp at tended one of my lectures she asked me if i would come to her branch and help them raise money and members both of which they desperately needed despite a clause in my lecture agency contract which forbids me to make unscheduled free lectures i agreed to come a few days later i received a letter from the embarrassed white liberal the lecture was off the naacp national office had advised that i was not to speak i have kept these items personal for a reason i can defend and prove each of them if challenged to do so but i am by no means the only one on the naacps list my sin is that i feel the naacp should become directly involved in direct action as a member andthenexecutive board person this was certainly my right what better place for a debate concerning naacp policy than naacp meetings themselves or is the pursuit of civil_rights impervious to free speech thirdly negro leadership attacks upon those who engage in honest open social criticism has begun to embrace pure meanness dr john morsells article the revolt of louis e lomax is the ultimate evidence of this item dr morsell blames me for misspelling a name and the inconsistency of certain dates mentioned in my book the negro revolt now i write books i dont edit proofread or publish them the job of correcting misspellings and making sure dates are correct is that of the proofreader and copy editor dr morsell should know this if he doesnt he is too stupid to lead anybody anywhere if he knows it and still made such charges he is a disgrace to his job and our people as well item dr morsell refers to me as a selfasserted naacp board member who that either i am a member of my naacp board or i am not if i am notand the books are certainly available to dr morsell roy wilkins top aid then i should be exposed for making such a dastardly public claim if i amand no one knows better than dr morsell that i was a board member at the time the book was writtenthen why call me a selfasserted member this was of course pure meanness an unvarnished attempt to smear my image as a local naacp official who dared speak out against the policy of the national office item dr morsell writes that i have managed to master the ageold negro art of fooling white people this from a top naacp official and a man of dr morsells mind at that is all but incredible as the executive director of a major foundation remarked to me they the naacp must be pretty frightened to write something like that but if the aim of this attack on me was to frighten off further criticism the naacp has all but succeeded i doubt that another negro writer will soon write criticism of the naacp even though to a man they agree much more should be both written and said finally negro leadership with the exception of james farmer of core has about lapsed into moderation on the race issue the distinction between the militants and the moderates is now rather easy to define the militants hold that there should be demonstrations calculated to paralyze the economic and political structure of a town until that towns fathers give us the freedoms the courts have certified the moderates favor additional legal wrangling or at best token demonstrations and this is the very issue between the naacp national leadership and me dr morsell makes much of the fact that the naacp staged sitins years ago he couldnt be more right i say as much in my book what he doesnt explain is why they stopped staging them had the naacp kept the sitins going the student sitin of and the freedom rides of wouldnt have been necessary and even while dr morsell was castigating me by saying the naacp had a long history of direct action dr stephen gill spottswood national board president of the naacp was calling the student demonstrations signal flares and roy wilkins was predicting that the funds for such forays would soon dry up if one is schizoid he can probably be both peter and paul but ill be damned if he can be both christian and pagan and this with respect to direct action is precisely what naacp national leadership is trying to do at dead center of all this as i point out in my book is the burning need for negro leadership to meet at the summit and parcel out areas of action and responsibility core martin_luther_king and the student non violent coordinating committee are experienced mass demonstrators let them march into the streets and the market place and the rest of us should either march behind them or send them money to buy marching shoes and the first national negro leader who throws stoneshard or soft should be unfrocked the naacp legal defense and education fund is the nations top civil_rights law firm and it is ours it belongs to us jack greenbergs job is to get us out of jail and fight our case when we demonstrate for our rights let jack greenberg do it and the rest of us should give him a hand when it comes to raising the funds to carry on this being true why is it necessary for the naacp to maintain its own legal division although the naacp legal defense and education fund is a separate entity roy wilkins insists that it and the naacp are under the same umbrella fine but if true just what is robert carters job and why is attorney carter beating the bushes for money to increase his legal office to a a year operation the naacp is without question one of the best of the lobbies its contacts with big white people in high places cannot be duplicated here is an important role after all the naacp does talk to the establishment and to be sure the establishment runs this republic there is enough prejudice to go around negroes dont have to squabble over the right to grapple with mean white people there are enough of them to keep all of us busy for the next twentyfive years what we must do is unify decide who will hit where and with what weapons this done the rest of us like good little indians should fall in line we are on our way no one desires to displace our present leaders we do ask that they lead us rather than follow white moderation come what may we are on our way if our leaders wont go then dont hinder us for we are on our waythank godto freedom land have negro ministers failed their roles by dr nathan hare may come as a suri v prise to many persons r to see negro clergy men analyzed as if they were merely human beings past practice has been to let them hide behind a pious shield of infallibility which while protecting them from public rebuke shut out the advantages of kind and impartial appraisal it is no secret however that they are talked about like wenches by their membersbehind their backs in a manner which cannot help them because it is kept a secret from them my own decision to offer the clergy the charity of my frank and unexpurgated observations came only after my sympathy for them was aroused by the sorrowful manner in which they have begun to cry out in distress c eric lincoln for example a methodist minister and an expert on the black muslims in america has bemoaned the efficiency of malcolm_xs contingency for stealing protestant ministers and other religious bigwigs reporting that as many as per cent of a typical muslim congregation is exchristian the rev james f campbell for another while pointing out that statistics show more churchgoers in america than ever before reports a drastic decline in negro attendance see what happened to the negros religion negro digest april the rev mr campbell sadly conceded that todays negro would just as soon go bowling but he concluded that it is simply a hard thing to figure out and chastized negroes for their fleeting piety i submit that ministers err in blaming it all on backsliding converts and elijah muhammed and father divine and so although i am not prepared to serve as a diplomat between ministers and their members i should like to give them the benefit if i may of the humble insights to follow assuming that if they know the truth then the truth shall set them free the passing of the shepherdpastor to understand the trend of waning negro piety we must look for the answer first in the changing society as it affects negro churchlife there is for one thing the special extent to which the negro has experienced the sudden transition from the close intimate familiarity of farm folk to the cold impersonality of metropolitan life and what that has done to the relations between minister and member the close friendship of the oldtime pastor of farm and small town life tor example has not been generated by the amicable strangers now elected to pastorates on the basis of their divinity degrees and formal credentials whereas the pastors life once bloomed side by side with his flocks both in and out of the church the cityward trek of the negro has brought him to the mass church and the sunday preacher who is seldom if ever seen closeup by the majority of his members this does not exclude the occasional postsermon handshake administered by him or one of his assistant pastors as members mechanically file from the church building this separation of minister and follower has made it ever less likely that the ends of the minister and those of the members will be of one accord quite frequently in fact the members find themselves pursuing salvation while their pastors pant after power and glory in general the shepherdpastor has been replaced by the administratorexecutive who even resents being called preacher and pompously demands the title minister thusly bent on officialdom he is consumed by a passion for presiding as an end in itself the passion for presiding the passion for presiding fed no doubt by a longing to master leads to an eternal turmoil of petty resentments a number of washington d c ministers recently were salty because a chicago minister rather than a local clergyman was chosen by the white chairman of an emancipation exercise to give the closing benediction similarly because the ministers chances of presiding are greater the higher his status they must constantly contend for position and official recognition this is due partly again to the factor of urbanization in the anonymity of the metropolis no longer is the ministers status wellknown and unchallenged throughout the community the resulting competition for renown impells him perennially to publicize his prestige in the struggle for conspicuous repute the consequences of this condition are now wellknown many persons have been appalled over and over again by the necessity for switching from the churchhouse to the courthouse and back again on the part of our major denominations in order to have disputes arising from power struggles among black men of the cloth settled by white judges thus although some still tell their flocks to take their troubles to the lord and leave them there they suggest by example that our troubles should be taken to the white power structure the reputation for this among negro baptist ministers whose policy appears to be to do unto others before they do unto you is even greater than that of our negro methodists when the baptist group flocked to kansas city for the event the mayor met them with warm words of welcome saying in effect according to the chicago crusader welcomebut go home if you came here to raise hell well these spiritual leaders including some wellknown advocates of passive resistance and nonviolence proceeded to do just that at one point a coterie of clergymen stormed the pulpit in an effort to keep the claimant to the throne off the speakers platform this resulted in the death of an elderly pastor and parttime mortician from detroit who fell off the back of the platform with another minister on top of him yet this is becoming an annual ministerial pastime and it is getting so nobody is willing or able to predict what might happen when negro baptist preachers convene however the conventioners eventually grow tired or perplexed by the debating of roberts rules of order and general parliamentary procedure then nominate unanimously or reelect the entire slate of candidates by a standing vote anyway the devotion to squabbling in addition to the annual and semiannual exhibitions of ministerial efforts to outpower one another negro churchdom is burdened with a continuous circus of church splits walkouts court suits and demands for recounts and new elections right on down to the local pastorates with such models before them it is no wonder that members do likewise when former heavyweight contender hurricane jackson was fighting and singing in a new york baptist choir he was impelled to drop out long before leaving the prize ring because they squabbled too much for him the same thing was borne out by my own past experience as a choir member in oklahoma and virginia the devotion to squabbling pervades most business meetings where pastors purport to preside over the transacting of church politics and finance but generally wind up invading the business or private affairs of various members some such meetings end in a battle of the trustees as was recently reported in the press regarding a clash between the pastor and deacons of a church in wilmington delaware police called to the ruckus said they found the meeting in a state of bedlam and several trustees were hospitalized for broken noses and lacerated cheeks the preeminence of the collection plate the fact that money matters increasingly are at the root of pastormember relations is apparent in the tendency to measure the success of a given sunday by the size of the collection lifted estimates of the collection consume the bulk of the banner and bulletin board publicity and the necessity for squeezing the utmost from the congregations tightmouthed pocketbooks is the source of the solemn sequence of offertories many an inexperienced church goer has proudly and selfrighteously placed a large bill in the first offering only to be confronted by a multiplicity of subsequent trays for foreign missions home missions guest speakers the pastor and last but not least the eternal building fund the perpetual construction of elaborate church houses giving rise to the preeminence of the collection plate in church circles is perpetrated by ministers largely as monuments to their earthly esteem the quest for conspicuous repute also is the major motivation for the various days programs where ministers can play at messiahship and otherwise bask in superficial divinity there are to name a few appreciation days anniversaries silver and golden although greenbacks always reign supreme institutes womens day mens day sisters day deacons day may day and just about every other kind of day short of judgment day although they will get around to that eventually this also reflects the widespread flair for pomposity and the spectacle which leads many pastors to promote the bizarre at the expense of the beneficial thus as carter g woodson the late historian once wrote in his miseducation of the negro ministers dont come any more so much to feed the multitude as they come to fleece the flock this is not due however simply to the love of money as some persons believe but is one aspect of the quest for conspicuous renown i say this in spite of the fact that many do have a fetish for big fine cars church station wagons and tailormade suits which in turn are deadly attractive to fast fashionable women inside and outside the church tall in the pulpit accordingly it will be boasted say that the national baptist convention of the usa inc is one of the most powerful organizations in the world and its presidency referred to as a juicy plum in their local churches some pastors parade as little emperors even the control of nationally elected officials is so great the representation of as many as colored christians at a given religious confab will pivot on the whims of the president when the largest conference on race relations ever held by religious groups of all racial derivations in america was scheduled for chicago in midjanuary of the largest negro group was the only major group in the country which did not accept an invitation to send official participants the reason according to a reporter for the chicago defender the president himself a chicago resident and pastor misconstrued the invitation to request his personal participation rather than the groups the president went on to explain that his position as chairman of the american negro emancipation centennial authority would not allow him personally to take part although he might occasionally find time to drop in as a spectator the true reason probably derived from the fact that as some ministers complained not enough negroes were represented on the planning and steering committee and as platform speakers although the conference allegedly was an effort in the first place to get white ministers participating for a change in the negros quest for freedom in all fairness however it should be said that ministers frequently do adopt a shareandsharealike policy with reference to whatever superfluous power they may attain indeed they promiscuously bestow titular blessings and honor on secular individuals a leading baptist group in chicago was so impressed by millionaire s b fullers cosmetics talk on religion in business and business in religion that it licensed the businessman for the ministry but without full rights in that he can preach in the pulpit but cannot preside over baptisms sacraments and marriage vows but i do not myself expect a ministers license for the things i have said here on the same subject of politics and business in religion as i unlike fuller and a number of leading ministers am neither rich nor a politician predictably one of the most popular recipients of superfluous honor from negro pastors is the rich white individual whenever he will accept recently a citation was presented to republican governor rockefeller following a nonpolitical address by a baptist minister in brooklyn new york the governor was cited as baptist layman of the year and of course a collection was lifted for the multimillionaire white ruler it was said that the relatively penniless congregation really dug into its pockets to come up with a whopping offering since ministers have told them that to him who hath shall be given however the governor was politic or political enough to donate the money in turn to one of the churchs moneyraising projects politicking preachers others who suffer from a want of power instead of a superfluity grope for recognition outside the confines of the congregation proper indeed beyond the boundaries of churchdom some however such as adam clayton powell and chicagos archibald carey reign supreme in both spheres but most are doomed to political dawdling and thus their political escapades less frequently come to light other ministers have been known to use their special position in the negros struggle due to their freedom from white economic pressure and the traditional white preference for their brand of rebellion and their access to a more or less permanent multitude of readymade followers to appease the passion for presiding and the search for publicity some fellow ministers even chastized a chicago batch who left the most segregated city in the world residentially according to a population research center study and flew south to fight segregation in albany georgia when that now forsaken but unintegrated city was the focus of national news coverage one group went on a much publicized missionary tour to russia since a number of africans have said they didnt want negro missionaries who have no blessings in their own country and presently a squad of ministers are crusading in jamaica much of the stamina spent hopping about from spot to spot on distant fronts might well be exerted in their own backyards at the last national baptist convention impressively generous plans were made to purchase acres in liberia to help liberian farmers get on their feet but only acres were purchased at home in highly publicized fayette county tennessee although it doesnt take newspaper headlines to point up needy negroes nary an acre was bought in the big city northern slums where droves of negroes unlike liberians are not only off their feet but actually are down on their haunches at the doorsteps of some of the most elaborate church houses in the country stiffcollar life likewise negro religious leaders have failed to help their followers tackle the problem of crime and immorality to any significant degree while strategically adopting the white policy of deriding what progress black muslims are making in that area to appease their guilty consciences they sniggle snobbishly that muslims contain all them exconvicts in defending their egos and sustaining their semblance of prestige via mechanisms of snobbishness and seclusion they shut out the very persons they are dutybound to save many ministers even draw back from the application of tight standards of morality to their own behavior they derogatorily label such norms as stiffcollar and resent with indignation any efforts to regulate the participation of themselves and their wives in excessive pleasure of a worldly nature some even laud the practice of appearing a bit mundane as modern and may even gain celebration as the swinging minister as in the case of a leading brooklyn pastor resting on peace others make use of a repertoire of showingoff behavior based mainly on lung power the chief power of a minister and related talents for oratory and the impromptu production of oral poetry but in spite of the fact that such ministers spend the balance of their time flying about the country delivering addresses they curiously get the lockjaw when it comes to speaking out against such rampart evils as the collective murder of modern war like their white counterparts they readily don uniforms and while safely out of range of actual combat assume the role of chaplains using their special contact with the divine to sanctify the killing done by young men they once taught never to kill it is not unusual moreover to read in a pastors biographical sketch printed at every turn in some weekly newspaper a longwinded account of all the theaters of war in which he has seen battle how strange that the battlefield is called a theater when most of the acting takes place during peace time certainly it is curious that the majority of negro ministers who so eloquently expound the philosophy of nonviolence have not breathed a word of warning to a single modern nationlet alone our ownregarding the folly and immorality of nuclear war they fall back along with white ministers on the consolation that god is on our side but nobody would have the gall to suggest that they are on gods side this sidling up to the lawd for reprieve from mass devilment is merely a quest for refuge from their early failure lipservant piety and copycat christianity increasingly it seems to me if negro ministers are to survive the competition with negro muslims and other temptations pulling members away from the church house they will find it necessary to rise above their role as lipservant experts for white contributions to morality so far they have failed to add to the wisdom of ancient biblical characters such as moses solomon and job resting content to parrot the conventional insights of leading white theologians this point recently was confirmed by the inadvertent testimony of rev e franklin jackson president of the washington branch of the naacp after a speech delivered by congressman adam clayton powell at a rally honoring the editor of the washington afroamerican the rev dr jackson rose to lift the offering and said to the sprinkling of whites present in the negro crowd we negroes have added just two things to religionthe spirituals and the practice of walking to the collection table the rest we borrowed from you instead of stressing those aspects of the christian religion most appropriate to the demands of the negros condition such as a policy of good deeds and sustained endeavor for selfuplift based on the admonition that everybody is responsible for his own salvation and that god helps those who help themselves ministers as a group have naively or selfishly played up poetic dictums rationalizing the negros lot and soothing his psy chological injuries such as it is better to give than to receive and the meek shall one day inherit the earthapparently by simply remaining meek and doing nothing to warrant the prize many devote the bulk of their sermons to tirades on the sinfulness of their flocks extinguishing what little selfrespect they may have had some ministers even echo the petty ethnic prejudices of white religious bodies one leading minister remarked publicly that he would rather see his daughter dead than married to a catholic he succeeded in breaking up an impending wedding of his daughter and a catholic a former white professor of mine at the university of chicago and now president of the american sociological association everett c hughes who like myself was the son of a baptist minister used to make the point that white christians have been the greatest carriers of racial prejudice for example that the world has ever known they rationalized and justified slavery for centuries and have participated in all of the major wars of modern times not to mention the holy hell of the holy crusades they failed to take the lead in the current struggle for equality of opportunity and have lagged behind the courts the schools and other secular institutions they trailed the european explorers into africa hawaii and wherever else the explorers led them they would follow now enlightened africans are saying that once we had the land and the white missionaries came and brought us the bible now we have the bible and they have the land thus while most of the current crop of negro ministers are pathological imitators of white clergymen the new negro minister must break away from such mere copycat behavior he must disdain the lure of ritualism adopted for the mere purpose of appearing proper and saintly or to gain a superficial sense of getting something done he must replace the huffing and puffing of the present breed of orators with strong deeds and sustained action based on a sound program of uplift and morality in all of these things he must resist the impulse to seek personal glory at the expense of a trusting flock this is not all of it there are other points one could make and many examples to support those already presented just as there are exceptions to many of them but these exceptions as in everything else are no refutation of the general condition on the other hand whatever exceptions may exist are the only salvation of the negro church which they can save if they are willing to suffer for the bad and if they can persuade those who have deflected from their calling to erase past missteps and set out again resolved to withstand the temptations of present and future trivia how to become a negro leader by a t hendricks it helps if you are a negro but this is not an absolutely essential requirement congressman adam clayton powell has spoken at some length on this topic therefore i shall not bore you with a needless reiteration of who runs your negro organizations in your quest to become a negro leader remember this others before you have overcome the handicap of not having been athletes or popular entertainers if you cant hit the curve ball or a high c dont fret there are other ways of getting to the top of the heap an invaluable aid to becoming a negro leader is an address outside the negro community this will give you a more objective view of those whom you will represent it also helps if your children do not attend the same public school as other negro children this too will lend a certain cool dispassion to your pronouncements on de facto school segregation and the pace at which it should be cured get mentioned in the new york times preferably denouncing malcolm_x or adam clayton powell remember one mention in the times is equal to two mentions in the new york post or four mentions in jet how often you get mentioned in the daily press will depend to a large extent upon how often their editors need someone to deplore bellicose statements by irresponsible negro militants you cannot so to speak carry the ball you must wait for the white press to dribble it to you one of the best ways to become a negro leader is to get yourself photographed with prominent white people even if you can cadge an invitation to the white house getting photographed there has its disadvantages you are likely to get lost in the mob of other negro aspirants clustered around its distinguished occupants the best way to get yourself photographed with a prominent white person is to give him an award for meritorious service in the fight for negro equality this can be rather risky though since there is always a chance that someone in your audience may recognize the honoree as a landlord who doesnt rent to negroes or an industrialist who confines his employment of negroes if at all to the janitorial level do not be discouraged the experience will be good practice for your role as negro leader you will learn how to combat such sharpeyed troublemakers you will learn or your career will perish as a negro leader you should be willing even eager to speak outagainst other negroes for instance when the white daily in your town calls up to get your comments on malcolm_xs call for civil insurrection you will not say id like to see some evidence of that statement before making any comment such nitpicking will immediately brand you as a possible supporter of extremist elements the correct reply to such a query would be violence is not the answer this will be a good phrase too to appease animallovers who may object when a negro participating in a mississippi voter registration drive cuffs a police dog who is about to fang him in the jugular vein remember you cannot go wrong with a statesmanlike violence is not the answer it will show where you stand on bloodletting another handy word is deplore like allpurpose new crisco the verb to deplore can be used to fry all sorts of things for example you can deplore racism of all kinds or you can deplore the appointment of public figures negro on the basis of race etc etc this brings us to stock phrases keep a good supply at hand remember stock phrases are an indispensable part of the rhetorical equipment of all leaders black or white use them liberally example never before in history has a people made such great strides in baseball the switchhitter has a decided advantage over the batter who swings from only one side of the plate in negro leadership you will be a leg up if you can talk out of both sides of your mouth at the same time remember there are more important things in this world than consistency you do not have to tell white audiences the same thing you tell negro audiences our negro youth is not preparing itself for the wonderful opportunities ahead goes over big with white listeners negro listeners on the other hand might get hacked especially if they have been preparing for the future by stocking up on application blanks for unemployment insurance in pursuing your goal to become a negro leader you may want to employ the researchstudy bit remember there is a vast difference between stating an obvious fact and researching an obvious fact remember too that research grants to study obvious facts can help the unemployment situation by providing jobs for deserving social workers lastly as a responsible negro leader it is encumbent upon you to let white people know we do not hate them make them feel loved a word of caution you do not have to go to such extremes as marrying one of their daughters merely to prove your point just tell them theyll be happy to take your word for it now you are on your own go out and seek your rightful place in the cosmos of the black establishment good luck and bon appetit as we read the letter by eddie b ellis jr would be interesting to note the re action of the young people in and around the negro community to the open letter that jackie robinson recently wrote to representative adam clayton powell jr jackie robinson to most of us is the symbol of the negros struggle to achieve equal rights there is no young adult in the negro world who doesnt know the jackie robinson story there are no young people in the negro community who dont hold jackie robinson in the highest esteem for we all know that this courageous man fought the cruel injustices of an ignorant society everyone knows that baseball is supposed to be the national game of the united states yet until jackie robinson the negro population onetenth of the total american public was not represented in this game we all know how branch rickey vice president of the then brooklyn dodgers dared to defy the narrowminded and the bigots to allow jackie robinson to play organized major league base ball and we all know that willie mays maury wills elston howard and all the other negro major league stars are the end result of jackie robinsons courage on the other hand we have adam clayton powell jr the son of adam clayton powell sr who was one of the pioneers in the fight for civil_rights here we have a man who as an individual has done almost singlehandedly the most to help the cause of equal rights that the negro is seeking in adam powell jr we have the single most powerful negro politician in america today in the minds of the young adults of our country the name of adam clayton powell may not be stamped as indelibly as that of jackie robinson but i am sure that it is there and it is well respected many of us who were either too young to understand or who never really took the time to learn about adam powell will surely remember our mothers and fathers speaking of him in almost reverent terms as the minister of the abyssinia baptist church in harlem we remember our parents talking of the wonderful way in which he inspired the negro people from his pulpit and gave them a sense of pride and belonging we remember hearing of how he got many negroes jobs when jobs were hard to get even for whites we remember hearing of the bread and soup lines at abyssinia baptist church feeding those who didnt have jobs and barely if any means of support and we remember how he took his fight to congress constantly we are reminded that adam powell has always been our champion and has always placed the welfare of the negro ahead of everything else and we all look up to him and respect him tremendously even though adam powell was at his best just a little before most of us reached the age of reason we have been reminded so relentlessly of all the good he has done that we regard him with the greatest admiration now we are faced with a problem the man we all know about has suddenly lashed out and with good reason at the man we have all heard about and we all wonder just what will come of it although we were told that in context adam powell is the negroes negro the fighters fighter the congressmens congressman in our time adam powell hasnt been the fighting congressman we all have heard so much about in recent years we have read so much about his absentee record and of his delinquency to his congressional duties yet because we hold adam powell on a pedestal we never questioned his motives and we saw his results and they were good hand in hand with organizations like core sclc and the naacp adam powell has been fighting bigotry and bias in america and we believe that adam powell is still our champion the national association for the advancement of colored people has long been associated with equal rights civil liberties and all the ingredients that go with the baking of an equal citizenship cake we have heard from our parents and we have seen for ourselves the work of the naacp the single most important organization in bringing about many of the civil liberties we now have and because of our ages we tend to take for granted we have been told by our parents that they didnt enjoy many of the freedoms that we scoff at lightly today and again we are confronted with a problem we hear adam powell criticize the naacp and ask for negro support in boycotting this wonderful organization in addition we hear and read jackie robinson criticizing adam powell and we are more confused than ever we all wish that adam powell would reevaluate his high office and the responsibility he has to the negro people and act accordingly we would like to be able to tell our children as our parents told us of the civil_rights fighter who by that time if he takes stock of himself and mends some of his ways will be a legend we would also like to be able to tell our children of the organization that helped our parents helped us and will help them to achieve all of those freedoms that were promised us in the constitution and bill of rights last but not least we would like to be able to tell our children of jackie robinson the great baseball player the courageous fighter the great american who helped bring it all about by simply writing an open letter to a friend the case of the athletic patsies by a s doc young he plan was neatly set the instructions were g few and simple reward was ample a brandnew sleek and expensive automobile plus expenses and other gratuities all the sports star had to do was alight from this airplane in this major city walk a few feet across the airport and shake hands with this waiting republican candidate while flash bulbs flashed and movie cameras made motion pictures but believe it or not the star athlete goofed it all up he shook hands with the wrong man not because he was in any way a stupid personfar from itbut simply because he didnt know the republican candidate he was supposed to shill for this is but one odd incident from a running ageold saga which might well be entitled the case of the athletic patsies over the years as dozens of powerhungry political candidates underestimated the intelligence of negro voters dozens of americas greatest negro athletes have been lured into their nets with promises of green dollars and the athletes often believing that they are putting over a fast one have played the strange role of momentary campaigners the allstar roster of sometimepoliticians include joe louis sugar ray robinson jackie robinson jesse owens willie mays mai whitfield andmany of his critics sayernie banks the chicago cubs infielder banks it should be noted differs from the others in an allimportant aspect which will be explained shortly yet when his chicago aldermanic candidacy was announced by republican leaders last winter more than a few veteran observers sighed well here we go again there is of course no reason why athletes shouldnt enter politics nearly everyone else does as one writer said in retort to banks critics why shouldnt he run for city council he might be right at home some of those guys have been playing ball for years ralph metcalfe the extrack ace is one athlete who has made the transition successfully a chicago alderman or city councilman for several years metcalfe one of congressman william dawsons beneficiaries ran for of fice under his own name and won similarly banks entered the aldermanic race under his own colors as did archie moore when he campaigned for a lameduck post in southern california as did monte irvin in new jersey a few years ago as did former ohio state university and chicago bears gridder bobby watkins in chicago more recently these then are not the athletic patsies of which we speak the athletic patsy per se is employed by politicians on much the same basis as cigarette manufacturers utilize the testimonial advertisement with this exception the athletic patsy doesnt necessarily smoke his candidate nor does he necessarily vote the cold calculated theory is that since negro voters idolize the athlete they will accept his advice on voting for candidates ranging downward from united states president the athlete pockets a few bucks his ego expands at the touch of a warm handshake with the candidate the publicity is gratifying but once the campaign is over win lose or drawthe athletic patsy is seldom if ever appointed to an important position nor is he consulted on such issues as civil_rights or real estate taxes he is instead a discarded tool mai whitfield the olympian was more fortunate than most athletic patsies which he freely admits he was mai was appointed to a southern california post that paid for oncemonthly meetings only recently have the top echelon of discerning politicians begun to realize that negroes dont seek advice nor votingbooth instructions at ball games what the average star athlete has to say about a political candidate means next to nothing when negroes enter the polls when the lucid highlyintelligent olympian jesse owens supported alf landon for president back in he joined a losing republican squad which suffered a worse trouncing than sonny liston administered to floyd patterson last september when joe louis went on television to question the wisdom of presidential candidate john f kennedys nowfamous telephone call to mrs martin_luther_king to inquire about her imprisoned husband few if any negro voters were swung over to richard nixon not once but twice jackie robinson the hall of fame baseball star went to bat for nixon and did something uncommon for him struck out both times in jackie plugged nixon for the united states presidency last year he supported nixon in the california governors race following jackies second political pinchhitting job for the loser a california writer observed negroes out here dont care if jackie robinson never returns to the west coast jackie a newspaper columnist who bats out cryptic retorts to his critics once explained his choice of nixon over kennedy by saying that when they met nixon looked him straight in the eye while kennedy apparently permitted his gaze to wander in the sports world this may be a legitimate test of guts soul or heart but as most experts will attest the steady gaze does not necessarily prove the truth of politicians when jackie supported nixon he exercised his constitutional rights he was free to support either nixon or kennedy the great tragedy was that jackie surely qualified by experience training and mental capacity to operate in the political firmament illadvisedly backed a loser had he been on the winning team in it is quite probable that he would be stirring up positive constructive action on the national scene today but the suspicion is that jackie didnt weigh heavily enough the fact that he was courted by politicians not because he was jackie robinson american but because he was jackie robinson internationallyknown athlete jackies services were courted and welcomed mostly because the politicians gambled that negroes who idolized him as a player would become properly starryeyed at the polls whether or not sugar ray robinson ever harbored serious political ambitions is not known but when vincent impelliteri was mayor of new york sugar ray was a handy ally to have around his harlem cafe was a gathering place for the political elite the mayor was so enamored of sugar ray that he was among the first to offer robinson consolation inside his dressing room the night he lost a bout to extreme heat and joey maxim not even sugar rays unconscious spewing of hot profanity on the mayorsugar ray was out of his mindcould break the strong bond of political friendship but now that sugar ray though probably wiser than ever before is no longer a fistic great his political stock is valued only slightly higher than that of billie sol estes enterprises aside from the fact that most athletes dont seem to realize as they reach for the easycome green dollars that negro voters do not now nor have they ever looked to them for political advice the same as they dont seek such advice in many other professional areas the athletes appear to be totally unaware of the fact that they are when asked to support a candidate momentarily merely being used as tools if the negro athlete were involving only himself no one would raise a howl but the fact is that the athlete himself the beneficiary of racial militant action sells out his own people and beggars his hardearned popularity when he shills for a politician whom he merely knows casually whose real beliefs opinions and practices he knows not mai whitfield by his own admission has yet to recover from his disillusioning experience as a sometimepolitician condensed from several thousand words this is mais story he was asked to support a candidate he was leary of politics from the beginning but militant friends of his assured him that he could help them do some good mai was encouraged as he heard these friends make excellent suggestions to the party superiors but as election time neared he realized that not one of these excellent suggestions were encompassed by the partys platform mai became ill later when as inaugural ball invitations were being passed around he and his militant friends were left emptyhanded what money id made was all gone before election time mai has confessed my friends got exactly nowhere with their proposals as usual the handkerchief heads got the gravyinvitations to the inaugural ball being most of it plus one or two meaningless appointments i decided to get the hell out of politics the ernie banks political story broke in chicagos daily newspapers like a big bomb of surprise at the time ernie was vacationing in california the announcement stirred up a giantsized hornets nest in a ward already buzzing busily with political activity political writers had to query ernie by longdistance telephone to ask if the report of his candidacy was true when hed decided to run what his platform was many political observers questioned the possibility of ernies properly serving his constituency if elected while contracted to spend much of his time out of chicago playing baseball ernie said he could manage it and cited as an example a canadian athlete whom he said combined sports and politics ernie candidly admitted that he knew little about practical politics but said hed like it especially if i can work with youth what did cubs owner phil wrigley think of his candidacy mr wrigley approved said banks hell probably vote for me quickwitted observers noted wrigley couldnt vote for banks they didnt live in the same ward while replying to another question as to his ability to function as a baseball star and politician banks said hed bridge the gap with a good office staff what was his platform banks said he hadnt constructed onehe would he said lay his platform after hed consulted his constituents when the official party organization met overwhelming refusal to back banks candidacy was voted someone claimed that banks had failed to vote in the most recent election but banks had his supporters too why shouldnt he run a beautician asked heatedly during a discussion of his candidacy hes as good as anyone else a popular newspaper columnist agreed substantially pointing out that banks was and is one of americas bestloved celebrities despite the hotglare of controversy and the longshot possibility of victory banks vowed that hed go on and fight the political fight but after the official party turned him down he was quoted as saying they sure strike you out fast up here said a man wise in race and politics theres nothing wrong with ernie banks running for city council except his timing i think hes being used by republicans who want to capitalize on his popularity they dont expect to win anywayso they dont get hurt if banks strikes out if ernie wanted to enter politics he should have waited until he was through with baseball and able to devote full time to public office too many important things come up in council meetings for our ward to be represented by a parttimer on the credit side this much could be said unlike the ageold athletic patsies banks was at least running for office not shilling for a stranger he was in a sense as was bobby watkins blazing a trail for modern stars and with a record of solid sports citizenry behind him he very well may have been paving a political success road for the future he was in case of failure using no ones face but his own to fall on banks candidacy reflected finally another credit factor modern negro athletes are slowly but surely branching out into areas of community responsibility often neglected by their counterparts of the past better educated than their predecessors they have a finer grasp of the intricacies of life they know better how to capitalize on their popularity there is no gainsaying the fact that any serious knowledgeable athlete who enters politics has a plusfactor ie his broad acceptance as launching power and the field of current sports encompasses many athletes who might very well become outstanding political leaders among them are ollie matson professional football star bill white professional baseball star walt dukes professional basketball star stan sanders rhodes scholar from whittier cal college rafer johnson exdecathlon great these and other politicallyminded negro athletes need not suffer the disillusioning experiences of the athletic patsies and they may take inspiration from this fact ralphe bunche was a basketball player the original musketeer lions of readers t yif and theatergoers vj ii throughout the world g have thrilled to the sz rt dumas writingsfor example the three musketeers and the count of monte cristo of alexandre dumas the father and camille of alexandre dumas the son now we are reminded by a book on napoleons exploits in egypt that dumas the father himself had a father who was a most remarkable manas remarkable in his way as his son or any of the characters created by that novelist this founder of the dumas dynasty was half french half negro and all hero he seems to have been as strong and brave a soldier as history records in battle there was a recklessness about him that was almost legendary he was entirely devoid of fear he possessed the divine simplicity of the negroso related the biographer herbert gorman of the first dumas one of napoleons generals general dumas father was a french nobleman and retired colonel of artillery marquis alexandreantoine davy de la pailleterie in he left france and acquired a plantation in the eastern part of santo domingo now the dominican republic on march he became the father of a son whom he named thomasalexandre the mother was a negro slave cesette dumas she died when the boy was the marquis later decided to return to paris and took with him his son then such was the custom of french noblemen with their colored sons the daughters were left behind thomas alexandre grew into an astonishingly powerful and attractive youth he enjoyed the company of many parisian ladies he was a friendly and kind hearted young fellow but his temper was easily aroused when a man insulted him in a theater box thomasalexandre simply pitched him out on the floor challenged to a duel he quickly killed his adversary because he was an expert with the sword and other weapons four years after his return to paris the yearold marquis who was becoming stingy and eccentric married his housekeeper rebuffed by his stepmother and denied funds by his father the young man told them that he was enlisting in the armyas a private i am a nobleman and a colonel the marquis exclaimed angrily you will not degrade my name to a privates rank then i will take my mothers name he retorted and as thomasalexandre dumas he joined a regiment of dragoons soon his feats of strength made him the idol of the outfit he was the only dragoon who by taking hold of one of the beams of the stable roof could hoist himself and his horse off the ground andre maurois records none of his comrades in arms could equal his feat of thrusting four weapons at the full extent of his arm in the summer of the french revolution was blazing fiercely and there were threats of peasant insurrection and looting at villierscotterets a town north of paris dumas regiment was sent there to preserve order and the townspeople turned out to welcome them marielouise labouret the daughter of a leading citizen noticed the handsome soldier and persuaded her father to select him when the residents were told to billet the troops the young people soon decided to wed and asked m labourets permission he told dumas you may marry my daughter when you are promoted to corporal within a few months the french armies were battling on several frontiers and dumas who eagerly supported the revolution was quickly raised to corporal lieutenant captain lieutenant colonel and at the age of to generaljust a week before his first child a daughter was born dumas experienced heavy combat in the pyrenees the low countries and in the alps one of his many feats was the single handed capture of a group of cavalrymen in the alps he led his troops up a steep slope by the use of climbing irons at the top was a palisade which the men could not surmount so he grasped them one after another by the seats of their pants and flung them over the wall into the ranks of the terrified enemy after alpine service dumas at was placed under the command of gen napoleon bonaparte aged for an italian campaign dumas performed prodigies of valor he captured six standards from a detachment larger than his from a spy he drew information that exposed austrian plans he routed a large army with a small one alone he held the end of a narrow bridge against a whole squadron these stories maurois insists are absolutely true a fellow general thibault called dumas the bravest strongest and most active man i have ever known his reputation in the army was extraordinary his many deeds of chivalrous daring and the athletic skill were quoted far and wide off the battlefield dumas was the kindest and friendliest of men he detested the grisly operations of the guillotine and once ordered such a machine to be chopped down and used as firewood for his men for this he was called m le humanite but in combat his enemies called him the black devil when bonaparte was assigned by the government to undertake his ill fated invasion of egypt in he immediately asked for and received the services of dumas in egypt as everywhere dumas was his courageous ceaselessly active selfhis leadership of cavalry charges threw the natives into a panic he quelled a revolt in cairo was the first man to enter the great mosque and sent a fortune to his commander with these words the value of this treasure is close to two million francs should i be killed remember that i am a poor man with a wife and child in france nevertheless relations between napoleon and dumas became strained the latter shrewdly perceived that the corsican was working only for his own glorification and that the egyptian adventure was headed for disaster dumas asked leave to return to france and his commander granted it but never forgot or forgave such desertion dumas chartered a small ship whose captain promised to land him in france but it was an unseaworthy craft and when caught in a storm it had to take refuge in a port of the kingdom of naples this region ruled by the bourbons was violently opposed to revolutionary france and dumas was imprisoned in the castle of brindisi for two years during his detention his food was systematically poisoned so that he lost his hearing and the sight of one eye he was partly paralyzed and a cancer of the stomach developed when in the spring of his th yearhe was exchanged for an austrian general his once magnificent health was shattered he was destitute when he rejoined his wife and daughter and the labourets bonaparte by that time was the allpowerful first consul to him dumas sent this letter you are aware of the misfortunes which have come upon me you are aware of the state of my purse you remember the treasure of cairo but i have other cause for griefi have been placed with other generals on the unemployed list bonaparte with typical cynicism did not reply gen dumas could not possibly be of further use to him the generals second child alexandre dumas was born july his skin was white his eyes were blue only the hair denoted his african extraction because mme dumas parents had means and were fond of their venturesome soninlaw the general lived in comfort in the country he and his little son were devotedly attached and the famous author of the future never lost his memories and admiration for his mighty sire when gen dumas was he was granted a boonpermission to hunt in the neighboring forests which now were napoleons imperial property he mounted horse for an outing but felt such pain that he was obliged to return and take to his bed he died that night that was the generalaction and adventure from the beginning to the end he was indeed the man fitted to sire the creator of dartangnan dantes and so many other heroes of war and romance charles white artist by hoyt w fuller the work of charles white has such simple directand profoundly poeticpower that it is astonishing he is not world famous well perhaps not so astonishing after all the artist is a negro characterized by great pride and integrity and his subject matter is almost invariably his own race i suppose i am trying to say something about negro people the slender softspoken artist explains negroes have been my primary theme for yearstheir beauty their feelings their aspirations there is no question that his message comes vividly through all the negro heartache and heartbreak and terror and suffering together with the indomitable spirit cry out from his work long before soul became a concept around which raceproud negroes could rally charles white was portraying it through his art for nearly six years now he has been living in altadena a los angeles suburb with a climate white terms ideally conducive to creative work his studio is a converted garage adjacent to his home and adjoining a large yard and patio but prior to moving to california he lived years on the east coast primarily in new york he admits that too much of his time in manhattan was spent in active involvemoonlighting from his regular work white designs an naacp recruitment poster fighting racial discrimination once consumed on unequal share of the artists time a striking figure mayibuye afrika is one of the original works purchased by playwright lorraine hansberry it is also available in reproduction ment with organizations at the expense of time at the drawing board but all that is behind him now while in new york he secured a good agent who still handles his work and spent a year at howard university as artistinresidence he also spent a year traveling through and over two years as a of mexico before settling down in altadena the foreign travel he now recalls as a great experieurope resident ence most of whites work is in black and white ink drawings prints woodcuts and lithography i work very slowly he says the older i get the more selfcritical i become he produces only about four or five paintings a year about eight years ago reproductions of a group of his drawings were massproduced and sold through art outlets in los angeles chicago and new york apparently none of them are available now although the prints represented some of his most moving work currently a new set of reproductions are on sale at selected outlets across the country and they too are very much in demand white now has been earning a living from his work since he was and was drawing and painting years before that he was born in chicago and it was in that city that his work first gained attention like so many chicago artists he studied at the art institute he also was an easel and mural painter and teacher with the federal art projects administration from to when he was drafted into the u s army later he studied at the art students league of new york and at the taller de grafica in mexico city his instructors included such noted painters as harry sternberg george neal edward millman alfredo zalce and briggs dyer over the years whites work has found its way into museums all over the world from moscow to brazil and even the library of congress a pennell fund purchase at least five negro universities have samples of his work as have the national academy of arts and letters and the american federation of arts the list of awards and fellowships white received between and included the john hay whitney fellowship the art institute of chicago scholarship two julius rosenwald fellowships and a grant from the national institute of arts and letters over the years his work has been exhibited in major galleries from san franciscos museum of art to manhattans metropolitan museum of art and in leading museums in leip sig germany and mexico city he painted murals at tuskegee institute hampton institute and the chicago public library white is listed in whos who in american art he is a member of artists equity association the german academy of art and the national association of artists and his work can be seen in galleries on both coaststhe aca gallery in new york and the heritage gallery in los angeles occasionally white accepts commissions to do commercial work and he recently designed covers for leontyne price record albums for rcavictor he was special graphic designer for the movie anna lucasta with sammy davis jr and eartha kitt released in by united artists he currently is designing a book on the late george washington carver for the field enterprises in chicago for many years whites work seemed to interest europeans more than americans and even those americans who admired and purchased his work were primarily white in recent years however an increasing number of negroes have been drawn to his drawings and lithos and such wellknown names as harry belafonte who owns white pieces sidney poitier roland hayes paul robeson eartha kitt and nat king cole have collections of his work this is most gratifying white says i am extremely happy that negroes are now interested in their own subjects in art a highly disciplined worker white rarely leaves his home and studio for long periods anymore and his schedule is as regular as if he were punching a clock this fall exhibitions of his work have been arranged for several european cities and a show is set for occidental college in the winter but there is no certainty that the artist will be on hand for the openings his satisfaction comes from creating it is a glorious experience being an artist he says to seek the meaning of truth reality beauty in short to meet the challenge of life through ones sensitivities for me art is a very personal intimate communicative affair he pauses reflects then goes on to the point i look to the life of my people as the fountainhead of challenging themes and monumental concepts i strive to create an image that all mankind can personally relate to and see his dreams and ideals mirrored with hope and dignity and one has only to see charles whites work to know how well he has succeeded i have nothing against white people by mary dickerson bangham have nothing against i white people so long as they stay in their place but when one of them says negroes should be shipped back to africa he has overstepped what would our country do without negroes in the sports world or in the entertainment world or in the shoeshining and windowwashing worlds what would the armed services do without negroes to fight for liberty and to uphold our democratic way of life why if negroes were shipped back to africa the white men would just have to go haul them back like they did in the first place besides if negroes should be shipped back to africa shouldnt whities be shipped back to where they came from geography sharks figurative sharks could help rout out and send those whose ancestors followed on columbus shipborne heels back to italy and spain those whose ancestors were on the mayflower passenger list to holland and england miscellaneous descendants to miscellaneous ports leaving america to the reds red indians that is this would solve the race problem in case enough ships were not available a few yellow people might be flown in from asia the red men let off the reservations and temporary relief found through this change in the balance of color population explosions might necessitate frequent rebalancing some whities say negroes have mental capacities differing from theirs to be sure not many white people have brains like george washington carvers or booker t washingtons or james weldon johnsons or marian andersons or ralph bunches or howard thurmans better end the list before some reader sees red and labels the writer a red writer is a whitie who claims the right to write while imagining herself some other hue many whities say negroes are shiftless this shifts the subject into an area where there are no restrictions it might be good for southerners who want college degrees to spend one academic year in the north where theyd learn that negroid coloring does not rub off and diplomabent northerners to spend an academic year in the south where they would learn that blacks can outnumber whitesnot on campuses of course but in certain land areas this involves problems for advanced math students some wag suggested that race problems might be solved by studying the new testament a harmless suggestion since it has not yet been banned as subversive literature however there are spots alien to our modern culture which require interpreters the fact that the entire bible appears in plain black and white causes some confusion confusion compounded by many new testaments being published with the words of jesus in red a new color scheme will surely be devised soon having a commondenominator rib adam and eve doubtless belonged to the same race but which one bible writers evidently considered it unimportant to explain humanitys variegations couldnt god have made us of one color say green since we all act pretty green at times or blue since everybody gets blue once in a while or yellow for who hasnt a yellow streak or two different colors look pretty when mixed up in the landscape prettier than monotones maybe god looks at it that way but what im really thinking about now is that ive nothing against the human race so long as it stays in its place confessions of a liberal by norman podhoretz wo ideas puzzled me v deeply as a child grow ing up in brooklyn during the s in what today would be called an integrated neighborhood one of them was that all jews were rich the other was that all negroes were persecuted these ideas had appeared in print therefore they must be true my own experience and the evidence of my senses told me they were not true but that only confirmed what a daydreaming boy in the provincesfor the lowerclass neighborhoods of new york belong as surely to the provinces as any rural town in north dakotadiscovers very early his experience is unreal and the evidance of his senses is not to be trusted yet even a boy with a head full of fantasies incongruously synthesized out of hollywood movies and english novels cannot altogether deny the reality of his own experienceespecially when there is so much deprivation in that experience nor can he altogether gainsay the evidence of his own sensesespecially such evidence of the senses as comes from being repeatedly beaten up robbed and in general hated terrorized and humiliated and so for a long time i was puzzled to think that jews were supposed to be rich when the only jews i knew were poor and that negroes were supposed to be persecuted when it was the negroes who were doing the only persecuting i knew aboutand doing it moreover to me during the early years of the war when my older sister joined a leftwing youth organization i remember my astonishment at hearing her passionately denounce my father for thinking that jews were worse off than negroes to me at the age of twelve it seemed very clear that negroes were better off than jewsindeed than allwhites a city boys world is contained within three or four square blocks and in my world it was the whites the italians and jews who feared the negroes not the other way around the negroes were tougher than we were more ruthless and on the whole they were better athletes what could it mean then to say that they were badly off and that we were more fortunate yet my sisters opinions like print were sacred and when she told me about exploitation and economic forces i believed her but i was still afraid of negroes and i still hated them with all my heart it had not always been sothat much i can recall from early childhood when did it start this fear and this hatred there was a kindergarten in the local public school and given the character of the neighborhood at least half of the children in my class must have been negroes yet i have no memory of being aware of color differences at that age and i know from observing my own children that they attribute no significance to such differences even when they begin noticing them i think there was a dayfirst grade second grade when my best friend carl hit me on the way home from school and announced that he wouldnt play with me any more because i had killed jesus when i ran home to my mother crying for an explanation she told me not to pay any attention to such foolishness and then in yiddish she cursed the goyim and the schwartzes the schwartzes and the goyim carl it turned out was a schwartze and so was added a third to the categories into which people were mysteriously divided sometimes i wonder whether this is a true memory at all it is blazingly vivid but perhaps it never happened can anyone really remember back to the age of six there is no uncertainty in my mind however that the years that followed carl and i hardly ever spoke though we met in school every day up through the eighth or ninth grade there would be embarrassed moments of catching his eye or of his catching minefor whatever it was that had attracted us to one another as very small children remained alive in spite of the fantastic barrier of hostility that had grown up between us suddenly and out of nowhere nevertheless friendship would have been impossible and even if it had been possible it would have been unthinkable about that there was nothing anyone could do by the time we were eight years old item the orphanage across the street is torn down a city housing project begins to rise in its place and on the marvelous vacant lot next to the old orphanage they are building a playground much excitement and anticipation as opening day draws near mayor laguardia himself comes to dedicate this great gesture of public benevolence he speaks of neighborliness and borrowing cups of sugar and of the playground he says that children of all races colors and creeds will learn to live together in harmony a week later some of us are swatting flies on the playgrounds inadequate little ball field a gang of negro kids pretty much our own age enter from the other side and order us out of the park we refuse proudly and indignantly with superb masculine fervor there is a fight they win and we retreat half whimpering half with bravado my first nauseating experience of cowardice and my first appalled realization that there are people in the world who do not seem to be afraid of anything who act as though they have nothing to lose thereafter the playground becomes a battleground sometimes quiet sometimes the scene of athletic competition between them and us but rocks are thrown as often as baseballs gradually we abandon the place and use the streets instead the streets are safer though we do not admit this to ourselves we are not after all sissiesthat most dreaded epithet of an american boyhood item i am standing alone in front of the building in which i live it is late afternoon and getting dark that day in school the teacher had asked a surly negro boy named quentin a question he was unable to answer as usual i had waved my arm eagerly be a good boy get good marks be smart go to college become a doctor and the right answer bursting from my lips i was held up lovingly by the teacher as an example to the class i had seen quentins facea very dark very cruel very orientallooking faceharden and there had been enough threat in his eyes to make me run all the way home for fear that he might catch me outside now standing idly in front of my own house i see him approaching from the project accompanied by his little brother who is carrying a baseball bat and wearing a grin of malicious anticipation as in a nightmare i am trapped the sursoundings are secure and familiar but terror is suddenly present and there is no one around to help i am locked to the spot i will not cry out or run away like a sissy and i stand there my heart wild my throat clogged he walks up hurls the familiar epithet hey mof r and to my surprise only pushes me it is a violent push but not a punch a push is not as serious as a punch maybe i can still back out without entirely losing my dignity maybe i can still say hey cmon quentin whaddya wanna do that for i dint do nothin to you and walk away not too rapidly instead before i can stop myself i push him backa token gestureand i say cut that out i dont wanna fight i aint got nothin to fight about as i turn to walk back into the building the corner of my eye catches the motion of the bat his little brother has handed him i try to duck but the bat crashes colored lights into my head the next thing i know my mother and sister are standing over me both of them hysterical my sistershe who was later to join the progressive youth organizationis shouting for the police and screaming imprecations at those dirty little black bastards they take me upstairs the doctor comes the police come i tell them that the boy who did it was a stranger that he had been trying to get money from me they do not believe me but i am too scared to give them quentins name when i return to school a few days later quentin avoids my eyes he knows that i have not squealed and he is ashamed i try to feel proud but in my heart i know that it was fear of what his friends might do to me that had kept me silent and not the code of the street item there is an athletic meet in which the whole of our junior high school is participating i am in one of the seventhgrade rapidadvance classes and segregation has now set in with a vengeance in the last three or four years of the elementary school from which we have just graduated each grade had been divided into three classes according to intelligence in the earlier grades the divisions had either been arbitrary or else unrecognized by us as having anything to do with brains these divisions by iq or however it was arranged had resulted in a preponderance of jews in the classes and a corresponding preponderance of negroes in the s with the italians split unevenly along the spectrum at least a few negroes had always made the ls just as there had always been a few jewish kids among the s and more among the s where italians dominated but the junior highs rapidadvance class of which i am now a member is overwhelmingly jewish and entirely whiteexcept for a shy lonely negro girl with light skin and reddish hair the athletic meet takes place in a cityowned stadium far from the school it is an important event to which a whole day is given over the winners are to get those precious little medallions stamped with the new york city emblem that can be screwed into a belt and that prove the wearer to be a distinguished personage i am a fast runner and so i am assigned the position of anchor man on my classs team in the relay race there are three other seventhgrade teams in the race two of them all negro as ours is all white one of the allnegro teams is very talltheir anchor man waiting silently next to me on the line looks years older than i am and i do not recognize him he is the first to get the baton and crosses the finishing line in a walk our team comes in second but a few minutes later we are declared the winners for it has been discovered that the anchor man on the firstplace team is not a member of the class we are awarded the medallions and the following day our homeroom teacher makes a speech about how proud she is of us for being superior athletes as well as superior students we want to believe that we deserve the praise but we know that we could not have won even if the other class had not cheated that afternoon walking home i am waylaid and surrounded by five negroes among whom is the anchor man of the disqualified team gimme my medal mofr he grunts i do not have it with me and i tell him so anyway it aint yours i say foolishly he calls me a liar on both counts and pushes me up against the wall on which we sometimes play handball gimme my mofn medal he says again i repeat that that i have left it home les search the lil mof r one of them suggests he prolly got it hid in his mof n pants my panic is now unmanageable how many times had i been surrounded like this and asked in soft tones len me a nickle boy how many times had i been called a liar for pleading poverty and pushed around or searched or beaten up unless there happened to be someone in the marauding gang like carl who liked me across that enormous divide of hatred and who would therefore say aaah cmon les git someone else this boy aint got no money on im i scream at them through tears of rage and selfcontempt keep your fn filthy lousy black hands offa me i swear ill get the cops this is all they need to hear and the five of them set upon me they bang me around mostly in the stomach and on the arms and shoulders and when several adults loitering near the candy store down the block notice what is going on and begin to shout they run off and away i do not tell my parents about the incident my teammates who have also been waylaid each by a gang led by his opposite number from the disqualified team have had their medallions taken from them and they never squeal either for days i walk home in terror expecting to be caught again but nothing happens the medallion is put away into a drawer never to be worn by anyone obviously experiences like these have always been a common feature of childhood life in workingclass and immigrant neighborhoods and negroes do not necessarily figure in them wherever and in whatever combination they have lived together in the cities kids of different groups have been at war beating up and being beaten up micks against kikes against wops against spicks against polacks and even relatively homogeneous areas have not been spared the warring of the young one block against another one gang called in my day in a pathetic effort at gentility an sac or socialathletic club against another but the negrowhite conflict hadand no doubt still hasa special intensity and was conducted with a ferocity unmatched by intra mural white battling in my own neighborhood a good deal of animosity existed between the italian kids most of whose parents were immigrants from sicily and the jewish kids who came largely from east european immigrant families yet everyone had friends sometimes close friends in the other camp and we often visited one anothers strangesmelling houses if not for meals then for glasses of milk and occasionally for some special event like a wedding or a wake if it happened that we divided into warring factions and did battle it would invariably be halfhearted and soon patched up our parents to be sure had nothing to do with one another and were mutually suspicious and hostile but we the kids who all spoke yiddish or italian at home were americans or new yorkers or brooklyn boys we shared a culture the culture of the street and at least for a while this culture proved to be more powerful than the opposing cultures of the home why why should it have been so different as between the negroes and us how was it borne in upon us so early white and black alike that we were enemies beyond any possibility of reconciliation why did we hate one another so i suppose if i tried i could answer those questions more or less adequately from the perspective of what i have since learned i could draw upon james baldwinwhat better witness is there to describe the sense of entrapment that poisons the soul of the negro with hatred for the white man whom he knows to be his jailer on the other side if i wanted to understand how the white man comes to hate the negro i could call upon the psychologists who have spoken of the guilt that white americans feel toward negroes and that turns into hatred for lack of acknowledging itself as guilt these are plausible answers and certainly there is truth in them yet when i think back upon my own experience of the negro and his of me i find myself troubled and puzzled much as i was as a child when i heard that all jews were rich and all negroes persecuted how could the negroes in my neighborhood have regarded the whites across the street and around the corner as jailers on the whole the whites were not so poor as the negroes but they were quite poor enough and the years were years of depression as for white hatred of the negro how could guilt have had anything to do with it what share had these italian and jewish immigrants in the enslavement of the negro what share had theydowntrodden people themselves breaking their own necks to eke out a living in the exploitation of the negro no i cannot believe that we hated each other back there in brooklyn because they thought of us as jailers and we felt guilty toward them but does it matter given the fact that we all went through an unrepresentative confrontation i think it matters profoundly for if we managed the job of hating each other so well without benefit of the aids to hatred that are supposedly at the root of this madness everywhere else it must mean that the madness is not yet properly understood i am far from pretending that i understand it but i would insist that no view of the problem will begin to approach the truth unless it can account for a case like the one i have been trying to describe are the elements of any such view available to us at least two i would say are one of them is a point we frequently come upon in the work of james baldwin and the other is a related point always stressed by psychologists who have studied the mechanisms of prejudice baldwin tells us that one of the reasons negroes hate the white man is that the white man refuses to look at him the negro knows that in white eyes all negroes are alike they are faceless and therefore not altogether human the psychologists in their turn tell us that the white man hates the negro because he tends to project those wild impulses that he fears in himself onto an alien group which he then punishes with his contempt what baldwin does not tell us however is that the principle of facelessness is a twoway street and can operate in both directions with no difficulty at all thus in my neighborhood in brooklyn i was as faceless to the negroes as they were to me and if they hated me because i never looked at them i must also have hated them for never looking at me to the negroes my white skin was enough to define me as the enemy and in a war it is only the uniform that counts and not the person so with the mechanism of projection that the psychologists talk about it too works in both directions at once there is no question that the psychologists are right about what the negro represents symbolically to the white man for me as a child the life lived on the other side of the playground and down the block on ralph avenue seemed the very embodiment of the values of the streetfree independent reckless brave masculine erotic i put the word erotic last though it is usually stressed above all others because in fact it came last in consciousness as in importance what mainly counted for me about negro kids of my own age was that they were bad boys there were plenty of bad boys among the whitesthis was after all a neighborhood with a long tradition of crime as a career open to aspiring talentsbut the negroes were really bad bad in a way that beckoned to one and made one feel inadequate we all went home every day for a lunch of spinachandpotatoes they roamed around during lunch hour munching on candy bars in winter we had to wear itchy woolen hats and mittens and cumbersome galoshes they were bareheaded and loose as they pleased we rarely played hookey or got into serious trouble in school for all our streetcorner bravado they were defiant forever staying out to do what delicious things forever making disturbances in class and in the halls forever being sent to the principal and returning uncowed but most important of all they were tough beautifully enviably tough not giving a damn for anyone or anything to hell with the teacher the truant officer the cop to hell with the whole of the adult world that held us in its grip and that we never had the courage to rebel against except sporadically and in petty ways this is what i saw and envied and feared in the negro this is what finally made him faceless to me though some of it of course was actually there the psychologists also tell us that the alien group which becomes the object of a projection will tend to respond by trying to live up to what is expected of them but what on his side did the negro see in me that made me faceless to him did he envy me my lunches of spinachandpotatoes and my itchy woolen caps and my prudent behavior in the face of authority as i envied him his noontime candy bars and his bare head in winter and his magnificent rebelliousness did those lunches and caps spell for him the prospect of power and riches in the future did they mean that there were possibilities open to me that were denied to him very likely they did but if so one also supposes that he feared the impulses within himself toward submission to authority no less powerfully than i feared the impulses in myself toward defiance if i represented the jailer to him it was not because i was oppressing him or keeping him down it was because i symbolized for him the dangerous and probably pointless temptation toward greater repression just as he symbolized for me the equally perilous tug toward greater freedom i personally was to be rewarded for this repression with a new and better life in the future but how many of my friends paid an even higher price and were given only gall in return we have it on the authority of james baldwin that all negroes hate whites i am trying to suggest that on their side all whitesall american whites that isare sick in their feelings about negroes there are negroes no doubt who would say that baldwin is wrong but i suspect them of being less honest than he is just as i suspect whites of selfdeception who tell me they have no special feeling toward negroes special feelings about color are a contagion to which white americans seem susceptible even when there is nothing in their background to account for the susceptibility thus everywhere we look today in the north we find the curious phenomenon of white middleclass liberals with no previous personal experience of negroes people to whom negroes have always been faceless in virtue rather than faceless in vicediscovering that their abstract commitment to the cause of negro rights will not stand the test of a direct confrontation we find such people fleeing in droves to the suburbs as the negro population in the inner city grows and when they stay in the city we find them sending their children to private school rather than to the integrated public public school in the neighborhood we find them resisting the demand that gerrymandered school districts be rezoned for the purpose of overcoming de facto segregation we find them judiciously considering whether the negroes for their own good of course are not perhaps pushing too hard we find them clucking their tongues over negro militancy we find them speculating on the question of whether there may not after all be something in the theory that the races are biologically different we find them saying that it will take a very long time for negroes to achieve full equality no matter what anyone does we find them deploring the rise of black nationalism and expressing the solemn hope that the leaders of the negro community will discover ways of containing the impatience and incipient violence within the negro ghettos but that is by no means the whole story there is also the phenomenon of what kenneth rexroth once called crowjimism there are the brokendown white boys like vivaldo moore in baldwins another country who go to harlem in search of sex or simply to brush up against something that looks like primitive vitality and who are so often punished by the negroes they meet for crimes that they would have been the last ever to commit and of which they themselves have been as sorry victims as any of the negroes who take it out on them there are the writers and intellectuals and artists who romanticize negroes and pander to them assuming a guilt that is not properly theirs and there are all the white liberals who permit negroes to blackmail them into adopting a double standard of moral judgment and who lend themselves again assuming the responsibility for crimes they never committed to cunning and contemptuous exploitation by negroes they employ to try to befriend and what about me what kind of feelings do i have about negroes today what happened to me from brooklyn who grew up fearing and envying and hating negroes now that brooklyn is behind me do i fear them and envy them and hate them still the answer is yes but not in the same proportions and certainly not in the same way i now live on the upper west side of manhattan where there are many negroes and many puerto ricans and there are nights when i experience the old apprehensiveness again and there are streets that i avoid when i am walking in the dark as there were streets that i avoided when i was a child i find that i am not afraid of puerto ricans but i cannot restrain my nervousness whenever i pass a group of negroes standing in front of a bar or sauntering down the street i know now as i did not know when i was a child that power is on my side that the police are working for me and not for them and knowing this i feel ashamed and guilty like the good liberal i have grown up to be yet the twinges of fear and the resentment they bring and the selfcontempt they arouse are not to be gainsaid but envy why envy and hatred why hatred here again the intensities have lessened and everything has been complicated and qualified by the guilts and the resulting overcompensations that are the heritage of the enlightened middleclass world of which i am now a member yet just as in childhood i envied negroes for what seemed to me their superior masculinity so i envy them today for what seems to me their superior physical grace and beauty i have come to value physical grace very highly and i am now capable of aching with all my being when i watch a negro couple on the dance floor or a negro playing baseball or basketball they are on the kind of terms with their own bodies that i should like to be on with mine and for and that precious quality they seem blessed to me the hatred i still feel for negroes is the hardest of all the old feelings to face or admit and it is the most hidden and the most overlarded by the conscious attitudes into which i have succeeded in willing myself it no longer has as for me it once did any cause or justification except perhaps that i am constantly being denied my right to an honest expression of the things i earned the right as a child to feel how then do i know that this hatred has never entirely disappeared i know it from the insane rage that can stir in me at the thought of negro antisemitism i know it from the disgusting prurience that can stir in me at the sight of a mixed couple and i know it from the violence that can stir in me whenever i encounter that special brand of paranoid touchiness to which many negroes are prone this then is where i am it is not exactly where i think all other white liberals are but it cannot be so very far away either and it is because i am convinced that we white americans arefor whatever reason it no longer matters so twisted and sick in our feelings about negroes that i despair of the present push toward integration if the pace of progress were not a factor here there would perhaps be no cause for despair time and the law and even the international political situation are on the side of the negroes and ultimately therefore victoryof a sort anywaymust come but from everything we have learned from observers who ought to know pace has become as important to the negroes as substance they want equality and they want it now and the white world is yielding to their demand only as much and as fast as it is absolutely being compelled to do the negroes know this in the most concrete terms imaginable and it is thus becoming increasingly difficult to buy them off with rhetoric and promises and pious assurances of support and so within the negro community we find more and more people declaring as harold r isaacs recently put it in these pagesthat they want out people who say that integration will never come or that it will take a hundred or a thousand years to come or that it will come at too high a price in suffering and struggle for the pallid and sodden life of the american middle class that at the very best it may bring the most numerous influential and dangerous movement that has grown out of negro despair with the goal of integration is of course the black muslims this movement whatever else we may say about it must be credited with one enduring achievement it inspired james baldwin to write an essay which deserves to be placed among the classics of our language everything baldwin has ever been trying to tell us is distilled here into a statement of overwhelming persuasiveness and prophetic magnificence baldwins message is and always has been simple it is this color is not a human or personal reality it is a political reality and baldwins demand is correspondingly simple color must be forgotten lest we all be smited with a vengeance that does not really depend on and cannot really be executed by any person or organization and that cannot be prevented by any police force or army historical vengeance a cosmic vengeance based on the law that we recognize when we say whatever goes up must come down the black muslims baldwin portrays as a sign and a warning to the intransigent white world they come to proclaim how deep is the negros disaffection with the white world and all its works and baldwin implies that no american negro can fail to respond somewhere in his being to their message that the white man is the devil that allah has doomed him to destruction and that the black man is about to inherit the earth baldwin of course knows that this nightmare inversion of the racism from which the black man has suffered can neither win nor even point to the neighborhood in which victory might be located for in his view the neighborhood of victory lies in exactly the opposite direction the transcendence of color through love yet the tragic fact is that love is not the answer to hatenot in the world of politics at any rate color is indeed a political rather than a human or a personal reality and if politics which is to say power has made it into a human and a personal reality then only politics which is to say power can unmake it once again but the way of politics is slow and bitter and as impatience on the one side is matched by a setting of the jaw on the other we move closer and closer to an explosion and blood may yet run in the streets will this madness in which we are all caught never find a restingplace is there never to be an end to it in thinking about the jews i have often wondered whether their survival as a distinct group was worth one hair on the head of a single infant did the jews have to survive so that six million innocent people should one day be burned in the ovens of auschwitz it is a terrible question and no one not god himself could ever answer it to my satisfaction and when i think about the negroes in america and about the image of integration as a state in which the negroes would take their rightful place as another of the protected minorities in a pluralistic society i wonder whether they really believe in their hearts that such a state can actually be attained and if so why they should wish to survive as a distinct group i think i know why the jews once wished to survive though i am less certain as to why we still do they not only believed that god had given them no choice but they were tied to a memory of past glory and a dream of imminent redemption what does the american negro have that might correspond to this his past is a stigma his color is a stigma and his vision of the future is the hope of erasing the stigma by making color irrelevant by making it disappear as a fact of consciousness i share this hope but i cannot see how it will ever be realized unless color does in fact disappear and that means not integration it means assimilation it meanslet the brutal word come outmiscegenation the black muslims like their racist counterparts in the white world accuse the socalled negro leaders of secretly pursuing miscegenation as a goal the racists are wrong but i wish they were right for i believe that the wholesale merging of the two races is the most desirable alternative for everyone concerned i am not claiming that this alternative can be pursued programmatically or that it is immediately feasible as a solution obviously there are even greater barriers to its achievement than to the achievement of integra tion what i am saying however is that in my opinion the negro problem can be solved in this country in no other way i have told the story of my own twisted feelings about negroes here and of how they conflict with the moral convictions i have since developed in order to assert that such feelings must be acknowledged as honestly as possible so that they can be controlled and ultimately disregarded in favor of the convictions it is wrong for a man to suffer because of the color of his skin beside that cliched proposition of liberal thought what argument can stand and be respected if the arguments are the arguments of feeling they must be made to yield and ones own soul is not the worst place to begin working a huge social transformation not so long ago it used to be asked of white liberals would you like your sister to marry one when i was a boy and my sister was still unmarried i would certainly have said no to that question but now i am a man my sister is already married and i have daughters if i were to be asked today whether i would like a daughter of mine to marry one i would have to answer no i wouldnt like it at all i would rail and rave and rant and tear my hair and then i hope i would have the courage to curse myself for raving and ranting and to give her my blessing how dare i withhold it at the behest of the child i once was and against the man i now have a duty to be by william barrow hen ivory coast w president felix houphouetboigny arrived in washington for a state visit in what he brought with him was not merely a feeling of friendship for the united states seldom found among african leaders brought to brainwashed americans a startling new image of afwomanhood for he also when marie even rican svelte cool and elegant therese houphouetboigny stepped off the plane that had whisked her in from paris the most prejudiced of the washington correspondents had to admit thatby any standards they chose to judgehere was an exquisite lady during the few days that president and madame houphouetboigny were white house guests washington society was agog at state function or informal luncheonwhenever she appearedthe cocoacolored african beauty effortlessly seized the spotlight not only did she possess a natural grace worthy of a princess but she was invariably attired in clothes befitting a queen out of socalled darkest africa had emerged a jewel so brilliant as to light up the capital of the worlds most powerful nation for a first lady of such uncommon charm it perhaps was inevitable that marie therese houphouetboigny would be compared to jacqueline kennedy the press dubbed her africas jackie meaning to compliment her and there are indeed points of similarity between the two beauties madame houphouetboigny like mrs kennedy is familiar with the life of paris although the african first lady lived there for several years while the american first lady studied there only briefly and like mrs kennedy madame houphouetboigny is a connoisseur of fine clothes good art and gourmet food an advocate of excellence but there the similarities all but end madame houphouetboigny was born marie therese brou years ago in one of the suburbs of abidjan capital of the ivory coast at she was dispatched along with other local girls to private schools in france there she grew up learning all that was accessible absorbing all the bountiful culture about her at she met and then married the most powerful man in her country mrs kennedy on the other hand was born to wealth and the man she married was just one of senators when they exchanged wedding vows as the wife of the chief of the most prosperous country in frenchspeaking africa marie therese houphouetboigny cannot help but set the pace in style and breeding and accomplishment for the young women of africa she is a splendid example if marie therese houphouetboigny is a paragon in the realm of politics and power leontyne price is her match in the lofty world of grand opera if not the prima donna assoluta of grand opera then miss price is unquestionably her closest rival a tall stately creature with the voice of a fullblooded angel and the grace of a lithelimbed cat she fills the operatic stage with an almost unbearable excitement from milan to manhattan and in all the musical centers in between leontyne price has been hailed as one of the great sopranos of all time hers is a classic story born in a little mississippi town brought up in the poor but dignified manner native to so many southernbred negroes there was no logical reason why her star should have ascended to such heights she sang in the church choir and studied music and voice as have thousands of girls from similar towns and families and finally she managed to go away to college wilberforce where she studied education in preparation for a career as a teacher but leontyne price had an ambition which would not be stilled and she had a voice the ambition was to stand on the stage of the metropolitan opera house and sing and she aimed to shape her voice toward that moment soon the students and faculty members at wilberforce had joined with the people of laurel miss in praising miss prices singing and when famed baritone paul robeson heard her on the campus fate stepped in robeson sang a benefit that raised for leontynes expenses at the juilliard school of music in new york and the way was clear few music lovers who heard leontyne price sing remained unmoved and her climb to the top rung in the music world was marked by successive encounters with experts who came to listen and stayed to praise producer robert breen cast her as bess in his revival of porgy and bess the national broadcasting company dared to star her on tv as the highpowered tosca and the eminent herbert von karajan made plans to feature her on the opera stage in europe her grand opera career began in when she sang in dialogues of the carmelites with the san francisco opera in the next two years she sang the lead role in aida in san francisco and at londons covent garden then von karajan invited her to sing the ethiopian princess at the vienna state opera and leontynes conquest of europe began she sang at salzburg and at berlin and finally at la scala and when she came home to open the met in ii trovatore in her triumph was complete now at the pinnacle of her success la price is one of a small group of superlative sopranos who can virtually write their own

brooksthat poets have so little honor in our land for this poet has the power to elevate our spirits and to enrich our souls in fact for that lucky minority of poetry lovers miss brooks has been providing elevation and enrichment for almost years since her first book of poems a street in bronzeville brightened the literary horizon back in those poems told all about life in the modest neighborhoods of chicagos south side that then boxedin area of the city where negroes were contained the walls of that particular ghetto have since crumbled and the people have spilled out southward and westward enlarging the ghetto formlessly but inexorably and the poems are marked by a simple beauty that is almost unbearable four years later following publication of her second book of poems annie allen gwendolyn brooks was awarded a pulitzer prize in harper published miss brooks first novel maud martha the novel like her poems is simple in structure spare and small and as deceptively potent as vodka lurking in orange juice it is the story of an ordinary negro woman making her way and a life in that same chicago ghetto and its statement of the human condition is profoundly moving it is unmistakably a poets work in the nearly ten years since maud martha there have been new poems from gwendolyn brooks and one of them an elegy to her novelist friend frank london brown was published in the september issue of negro digest she has appeared on various lecture platforms participated in a poets whingding at the library of congress resided at yaddoo presided at university

interesting points of coincidence in the real and stage lives of the two famed entertainers in no strings miss carroll displays a wardrobe fit for a queen in fact the lithe little ladys closest competitor for attention in the musical are the exquisite clothes designed by donald brooks when a decade ago the great josephine baker swept back into her native country on a theater tour the furs and gowns she brought with her from paris all but stopped each show and while miss carroll plays the role of an american model in paris josephine baker wasfor a long timethe model on which parisians constructed their ideas of american negro girls it was back in the early twenties when miss baker a longstemmed dancer out of st louis arrived in paris in one of her routines the daring young missourian wore a banana and not much else and paris went up in flames within record time jo baker was a folies bergere star and her name a theatrical byword fortune followed fame and soon la baker had furs the finest jewels salons in the city and chateaux in the country she was the darling of all france worshipped and pursued and she gave her heart in return to france and to frenchmen she made movies records appeared in revues and musicals and lived the life of the celebrated grande dame when war came to france josephine baker joined the french resistance forces at one point she was reported dead but months later following the fall of the vichy government she turned up very much alive in north africa where she had been tending wounded french soldiers the war over she returned in triumph to paris and grateful france awarded her the coveted legion of merit while jo baker the entertainer remained as great and as much in demand as ever jo baker the woman emerged from her war experiences profoundly changed she had witnessed firsthand the horror and brutality of war and she remembered the racial inequities of her childhood and suddenly she knew she had to do something useful with her life she embarked on a world tour found fabulous success everywhere including even americaand returned to france to begin an important new phase in her life with her husband jo bouillon jo baker purchased a huge chateau and grounds acres near perigord then she began adopting children of all races and creeds from all over the world using income from her tours to support them at last count a total of children were established in the bakerbouillon household at les milandes keeping what amounts to a whole town a chateau a platoon of servants and children demands a great deal of money and josephine baker has only her name and her talent on which to capitalize at then long after most entertainers have retired from the glamour derby the remarkable jo baker is still touring the world still dazzling audiences still earning a kings ransom she has indeed come a long way from st louis andfrom all indicationsshe still will go a long way freedoms song safe to say that the freedom movement in the south is a singing movement this is somewhat to be expected when one considers that music has strange power to evoke various emotional responses in the human animal it has historically been of special value to the oppressed in every age somehow the literature and idiom of music makes possible the restoration of lost hopes it binds up the wounds of the brokenhearted and by its character welds together the cohesive sentiment of a group of people of common experience in the experience of the children of israel particularly that of the period of the captivity we are able to see some evidence of this in the literature of the psalms extrabiblical sources reveal that the psalms were chanted in unison or antiphonally expressive of the particular emotion and experience to be conveyed one illustration suffices to indicate the significant role of singing during the captivity of the house of israel the th psalm infers that in the midst of despair the children of israel were tempted to stop singing by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for they that carried us away captive required of us a song sing us one of the songs of zion how shall we sing the lords song in a strange land and then the affirmation that despite the captivity the body and spirit of israel could only be held together by holding on to their faith through the only apparent medium available the singing of the psalter that stirred the fires of faith if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning if i do not remember thee let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem the faith of the nation in jehovah above my chief joy the history of hymnody details the role of music in the early church it was the thread of faith that bound the believers together in the face of the oppressive cruelty of the roman empire most revolutionary movements have been singing movements the overthrow of the czarist regime in russia and the rise of the labor movement in america are instances where music played its role it has been thus with the negro and perhaps uniquely the negro himself created the music that is helping to emancipate him the negro spiritual is the primal art form of the musical literature of america the religious folk melodies of the antebellum negro produced in turn the negro folk song which in turn evolved into the blues and thence into what we know now as jazz across the years the negro spiritual has maintained its integrity and its message while the perverted form of the spiritualthe blues songhas developed many different forms i use the word perverted here advisedly the spiritual is distinguished from blues primarily by its ultimate expressionspirituals though they speak of travail and woe are faithfilled and hopeful the blues while utilizing very much the same basic musical idiom is a song of despair and hopelessness i wish to submit that the negro spiritual the one pure music art form that america has produced has played a strategic role in holding together the threadbare hopes of a people reduced to chattel slavery and has served across the last years of emancipation to persuade them that a better day is coming from our present vantage point it is perfectly clear that the recent nonviolent thrust of the negro community might not have had the vitality and dynamism that it has were it not for the impact of the negro spiritual the natural response to music coupled with the deep meaning of the negro spiritual has produced a unique effect on the freedom movement in the south it must always be remembered that religious orientation of the freedom movement intensifies the effect produced perhaps it should be said that the freedom movements natural character of being religiously orientated is inseparable from the effect of the music of the negro spiritual they are each a supplement of the other the place of the negro spiritual in the musical literature of america has not always been clearly understood the negro community itself is just now becoming aware historically speaking of the spirituals critical significance to the communitys own development and progress we have set forth in an earlier lecture that had there been no negro church there would be no negro communitythat is a cohesive sociological grouping capable of influencing the mainstream of american life by the same token the faith expressed in the negro spiritual had very much to do with keeping the negro church intact there was a time not too long ago when the negro spiritual was somewhat in illrepute as far as a large part of the negro community was concerned they were naturally associated with the slaveexperience and many negroes were not willing to identify themselves with what they considered slave songs this was in large measure due to an effort not to identify with the group psychologists call this attitude produced by the system of segregation and discrimination selfhate mistakenly the negro of the middle class particularly as he laboriously improved his lot economically socially and educationally felt the negro spiritual represented a leftover from an era that had passed and the continued use of music was deemed out of date with the progressive age of which the negro was slowly becoming a part quite naturally the survival of any tradition written or sung depends largely upon the ethnic group from which it sprang this accounts for a decline in their use and for a while the infrequent attention given them as a genuine part of the musical literature of america progressive negro churches rarely found use for the negro spiritual save in the informal services where singing might occur without the accompaniment of piano or organ as the negro church became more structured and emotionalism began to decline there followed less frequent use of spirituals fortunately though there were some with vision and insight who recognized the real worth of this body of musical literature and who took definite pains to see that it was preserved in message content and idiom notable in these efforts were the fisk jubilee singers and the college choirs of many of the small churchrelated negro colleges in the south professor j w work dr r nathaniel dett harry burleigh and james weldon johnson did much to codify and preserve in writing the words and music of the negro spiritual that had existed for nearly two generations by oral tradition alone the dedication and persistence of these groups and persons over a period of years helped to awaken a new interest and appreciation in the religious folk songs of the negro the programs of roland hayes and marian anderson were never without a section given solely to negro spirituals they insisted on including them out of their honest concern and belief that the spiritual was a part of the great musical literature of the world for these worldrenowned artists it was only incidental that they themselves happened to be members of the community in which this strange and sometimes haunting music was bom during the last fifteen years there has been a revival of interest in the negro spiritual we have come to understand that the negro spiritual is not a slavesong at all true enough they were spawned in the midst of the slave experience but their message belies hope in a better day these songs are rather the portraits of the souls of men who though their bodies were shackled expressed in unmistakable terms that their spirits were free close scrutiny of the words of the negro spiritual evidences their absolute timeliness every genuine spiritual has a biblical origin and the truth of the bible is still as fresh as tomorrow mornings newspaper no real indictment can be made that the negro spiritual is out of date or oldfashioned as far as the inference made by many that the emotional content of the spiritual made them less appropriate for use in the formal service of the church the best expression of religion is one that is in proper balance emotionally and intellectually the extremes of emotionalism and intellectualism leave much to be desired when it comes to meaningful worship somewhere between the two extremes the proper balance of thought and feeling can produce a worship experience that is intellectually challenging and emotionally satisfying thus for me and an ever increasing number of devotees the spirituals of the negro fit with grace and facility into the worship order of any protestant church it is not unusual today to discover the spirituals being used in white churches as well as negro churches with considerable regularity let us consider the negro spiritual for a few moments purely as musical literature the masters of music tell us that for a body of musical literature to be adjudged as great music at least three essentials are required nobility of theme dignity of expression and originality of thought and medium the great body of the spirituals generally answer these basic requirements let us consider them one at a time nobility of theme the familiar spiritual go down moses represents a clear example of this one must consider the tremendous odds against which the antebellum negro labored to fashion his religious faith most of it was acquired through what he was able to glean from reading of the bible by the slave master and slave mistress it was transmitted then by rote to the other members of the slave community it is something short of miraculous that these slave people were able at all to gain clear insight into the meaning of the bible stories distill them through their own experience as slaves and create a musical idiom that was neither devoid of theological content nor the basic faith of the old and new testament the spiritual go down moses reflects the slave communitys perception that their own experience was a parallel to the slave experience of the house of israel under the egyptians and when intoned by them evidenced their faith that one day god would send them a moses to tell the pharaohs of the slave system to let gods people the slaves go what more noble theme could there be dignity of expression if you have heard the words of any spiritual and are familiar with broken dialect common to them all i suppose at moments there is the temptation to laugh it must be remembered however that the slave community was composed of a people who had been uprooted from their homeland against their will transported to a strange land and very often there existed the possibility of as many as forty different dialects being spoken the broken english they used was their feeble attempt to express themselves in a strange language and be understood however humorous their phonetic attempts were it must be kept in mind that the antebellum negro never intended anything funny his was a deadly serious attempt to convey through musical expression what he believed ultimately it was this music which did more than anything else to keep body and soul together one such spiritual de blin man stood in de road and cried exhibits the simple faith of the negro in the lord jesus christ to heal him from his diseases as he healed the blind man bartimeus who cried out for mercy along the jericho road as the galilean prince had mercy on a man born blind it was the hope and belief of the negro that he would be merciful to him in the affliction of slavery no matter how broken the dialect it was a sincere attempt to voice some facet of his personal and group faith thus the spiritual despite its brokenenglish quality does in fact possess a dignity of expression originality of thought and medium it is now generally conceded that the music of the negro spiritual is original to the negro in so far as any folk music is original of those who sometimes still assert that the negro folk idioms are derivations of revival hymns the question might be pertinently asked where is that wonderful matrix of hymnology out of which has grown these song jewels of negro spirituals it has long been accepted as scientifically true that the black man brought his musical idiom with him from his native land as he must have brought his susceptibility to religious suggestion it would of course be unreasonable to suppose that this idiom was entirely unaffected by environment further the wordpicture drawn in the poetry of the spirituals is matchless one such example is sometimes i feel like a motherless child the doleful intonations of this spiritual and the lucid description of how wretched the singers fortunes have become combine to telegraph immediately the deep sorrow though still buttressed by hope his condition is such that he feels as a child without a mother the one upon whom the child is totally dependent a long way from home this is philosophical selfanalysis this one example belies both originality of thought and medium the body of musical literature that embraces the negro spiritual fulfills the essentials for that which makes great music we can never know fully what the ability of the black man to improvise his troubles into artforms has meant to him very likely it serves as a sort of safety valve for his pent feelings saving the country from an even greater tragedy than that precipitated by the civil war and himself from a disaster equally great the paramount contribution of the negro spiritual is that it has brought to the world a great message of goodwill one of the most outstanding characteristics of all the songs is that free as the music is from cacophony and discord just as remarkably free is its poetry from any word of bitterness anger or reproach whatever the condition or circumstance the music of the negro spiritual plumbs the depths of human experience when he felt like giving up he would chant stay in de field until de war is ended in his moments of meditation and reflection he sang every time i feel the spirit moving in my heart i will pray in the midst of his troubles he would sing soon i will be done with the troubles of the world when he was remiss from the discipline of his faith he cried in penitence its me its me o lord standing in the need of prayer when death came close in confidence of another life he sang swing low sweet chariot cornin for to carry me home let us consider the character of the negro spiritual every genuine spiritual is easily earmarked by some very similar characteristics most of the spirituals if not all evidence certain basic qualities which warrant reviewing let me briefly discuss them the order is purely arbitrary the negro spiritual is characterized by its deep biblicism there is always a definite bible reference for the negro spiritual they were coined within the context of their deep religious faith and we find in them the clearest expression of the faith of the antebellum negro the titles ring with biblicism walk togedder children ride on king jesus didnt my lord delibered daniel and ole time religion are but a few to illustrate their biblical posture the spirituals possess a simple and repetitive musical idiom generally speaking the lyrics and music of the negro spiritual have a basic theme which is varied only slightly to differentiate between the refrain and stanza eg come by here ma lord come by here come by here ma lord come by here come by here ma lord come by here o lord come by here the stanzas continue in the same idiom and identical rhythm somebody needs you lord come by here somebody needs you lord come by here somebody needs you lord come by here o lord come by here this quality especially lent the spiritual to group and memory singing the spiritual was not only an expression of faith it was at times a device many many spirituals have double or codemeaning we could safely presume that for the most part the spirituals were created in their original form out of a genuine religious need and later on acquired the double codemeaning this is not to say that some genuine spirituals were not created out of a specific circumstance that required subterfuge and the spiritualmedium was the safest way to transmit the information without drawing suspicion chroniclers of the days of the underground railroad attest to the usefulness of some of these religious folksongs in making their operation a success story one such spiritual that was used for a secondary purpose is the familiar steal away when some of the plantation owners detected that the christian faith was spawning ferment in the slave community and surmised that perhaps they might be better off wihout the instruction in the bible from northern missionaries who frequented the south they forbade the slaves from attending the camp meetings this spiritual was used to alert the slaves from one field to another the day and place of the meeting the day on which the singing of this hymn occurred signaled the meeting to be set for that night and improvised stanzas indicated the precise location of the meeting viz across the river in the grove or trees etc sometimes it was used to signal another movement of the underground railroad this was the significance of the last line in the refrain in this instance i aint got long to stay here the use of the spirituals for their second or codemeaning has been varied and numerous another discernible quality of the negro spiritual is that of possessing profound thelogical content the mystique of the negro spiritual aside from their birth and existence is that their messages make sense theologically we must not overlook the fact that these people had no judeochristian heritage upon which to lean it is unlikely that the concept of monotheism had any meaning at all to them yet illequipped as they were and with the fragmented bits of faith they managed to forage as leftovers from the masters table they were perceptive enough to capture the meaning of what they believed and transmit it into religiomusical expression this is nothing short of fantastic the spiritual o lord i want to be a christian inamy heart a classic speaks the eternal truth that an individuals commitment to faith and religion must be something that is internal as over against that which is external it was as well a gentle gibe at the religious practice of the slave holder from whom he had siphoned his faith we cannot overlook the eternality of the message the negro spiritual lived primarily because of the timelessness of what it seeks to say this quality perhaps is a corollary of its deep biblicism the spiritual you got to walk dat lonsome valley you got to walk it for yoself underscores the eternal fact that each man must someday die and within the context of the christian faith must stand in the judgment on the basis of his personal faith and not that of another the words are searching and eternal you got to walk dat lonsome valley you got to walk it for yo self o nobody else can walk it for you you got to walk it by yo self the final two qualities can be mentioned together the spirituals are given to improvisation and are best rendered nonaccompanied by musical instruments the proper rendition of the religious folk songs of the negro makes the voices the accompaniment and the instruments much of the musical literature of the negro spiritual is designed to be sung antiphonally and coupled with its repetitive character it is readily understandable that a great group of voices could be handled as an organ expressive of many nuances of the negros songfilled faith it is the latter quality also that encouraged members of the group by design or spontaneity to take the lead and create in the midst of a rendition a new stanza once the pace or beat of the spiritual was established no great genius was required to fashion a line that would properly fit the musical idiom and the basic message of the hymn this new stanza would immediately receive the choral support of the others singing in the group this onthespot improvisation was and still is common in the singing of the spirituals how has the negro spiritual served the freedom movement in the south we have already set forth in an earlier paper in some detail the relationship of the negro church to the nonviolent revolution in the south against this background it is no mystery that with the negro communitys social life focused in the church and his protest movements religiously oriented it would follow that the music of the movement similarly would be that which is most informal and expressive of the deep yearnings of the ethnic group from which it has sprung it is an oddity that the introduction of the negro spiritual into the movement as a means of clear group expression of common goals and united efforts was through a young white folksinger guy carawan for many years mr carawan had traveled the south searching out the history and variations of negro folk music out of his own appreciation for them as a genuine artform and in an effort to develop his skills in interpreting the music of the negro that he used in his repertoire consciously aware of the value of music to unify and rally groups around a common aim mr carawan began to adapt the musical idiom of the negro spiritual familiar to all with new words geared to the new thrust for freedom in the south in conjunction with workshops sponsored by the highlander folk school at monteagle tennessee and public appearances around the south mr carawan collected and edited those songs most easily adaptable and most familiar it did not take very long for the idea to catch on in the various communities that he visited and individual protest movements began coining their own adaptations much of the content of present day freedom songs was worked out in jails of the southland as a means of killing the inevitable boredom of jailstaying and as a morale booster to those confined so much has the practice developed that it is taken for granted in any instance of jailgoing that the singing of freedom songs is the order of the day some of the freedom fighters in the south have paid severe disciplinary penalties in the prisons of the south because they insisted on singing in jail in my own experience of a halfdozen jailings the singing of the freedom hymns or songs has been for me an indispensable aid without which the jail experience might have been totally intolerable let me illustrate now the process of transference of a spiritual to the freedom hymn i have listed below first the spiritual as it appears in an original form then to the right the adapted typical form which is used in the movement i want jesus to walk with me i want jesus to walk with me yes i want jesus to walk with me yes i want jesus to walk with me all along my pilgrim journey all along this freedom journey lord i want jesus to walk with me lord i want jesus to walk with me in many instances the variation is at best slight as above the stanza of the original form is easily adaptable to the theme of the particular focus of the movement see below when im in trouble lord walk with me when im in trouble lord walk with me all along my pilgrim journey lord i want jesus to walk with me down in the jailhouse lord walk with me down in the jailhouse lord walk with me all along this freedom journey lord i want jesus to walk with me one of the most popular adaptations used by the albany georgia movement follows woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on jesus woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on jesus woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on jesus hallelu hallelu hallelujah woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on freedom woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on freedom woke up this mornin with my mind stayed on freedom hallelu hallelu hallelu hallelu hallelujah this example perhaps is one of the oldest of the spiritual forms but lends itself just as easily to the freedom hymn principle if you want to get to heaven do what jesus says if you want to get to heaven do what jesus says if you want to get to heaven do what jesus says hallelujah amen if you want to get your freedom register and vote if you want to get your freedom register and vote if you want to get your freedom register and vote hallelujah amen even the antebellum slaves had freedom songs one such hymn still a classic required only modernizing the stanzas oh freedom oh freedom this spiritual hymns refrain is and before id be a slave sung in its exact original form id be buried in my grave and go home to my lord and be free i have placed the original stanzas and the modern stanzas in juxtaposition to illustrate the principle we have been describing no more weeping etc no more segregation etc no more moaning etc no more jim crow etc and another over my head i see trouble in the air over my head i see trouble in the air over my head i see trouble in the air there must be a god somewhere over my head i see freedom in the air over my head i see freedom in the air over my head i see freedom in the air there must be a god somewhere numerous other spirituals lend themselves to the adaptations illustrated above but space will not permit their inclusion here they embrace such religious folk songs as amen in which the word freedom is inserted to replace the title word git on board little children in which the freedom train is substituted for gospel train and countless others we have mentioned earlier that the overriding theme of the spiritual music is the determined faith of its creators that a better day is coming it is safe to say and accurately so that the same theme permeates the message and fervor of the freedom hymns that have been constructed in the frame idiom and beat of the original music of the enslaved negro community the greatgrandchildren of the antebellum negro are singing of their travail four generations removed with considerably more determination and the better day considerably closer the theme song of the nonviolent movement we shall overcome is infused with that same optimism though the original form of this freedom hymn is an old prayer meeting hymn some oldtimers say the prayermeeting hymn developed from a religious folk song at any rate whatever its origin the integrity of its message has not been lost in its evolution nor in the modem adaptation within the nonviolent movement in the south for the sake of comparison the two forms are arranged as were the earlier examples ill overcome ill overcome we shall overcome we shall overcome ill overcome someday we shall overcome someday someoooh if in my heart i do not yield day ill overcome someday oooh deep in my heart i do believe we shall overcome someday one cannot describe the vitality and emotion this one hymn evokes across the southland i have heard it sung in great mass meetings with a thousand voices singing as one ive heard a halfdozen sing it softly behind the bars of the hinds county prison in mississippi ive heard old women singing it on the way to work in albany georgia ive heard the students singing it as they were being dragged away to jail it generates power that is indescribable it manifests a rich legacy of musical literature that serves to keep body and soul together for that better day which is not far off the lesson of birmingham the experience of birmingham preaches that the administration must quickly seize and act on the truth that the accent in race relations has moved from gradual to speed it must litigate it must exert executive power in connection with many federal construction and job training programs more vigorously and imaginatively than it has it must stand ready with troops to keep the peace justly and impartially for a number of southern governors are either not willing to do so at all or if willing intend to keep an unjust racist peace and the administration must be prepared to conciliate and mediate as assistant attorney general marshall did in birmingham and has done in other southern cities to the end that the parties may begin to work out among themselves problems to whose solution the law is not equal as yet and to whose complete and stable solution it may never alone be equal since robert kennedy and burke marshall will not always be in their present jobs it would be useful now to enlarge and formalize this conciliation and mediation function on a permanent basis in close coordination with the department of justice but

answer to his quest for the continued from page ethical ethics was nothing else but reverence for life it is then his conscience rather than his patients schweitzer has been serving however valuable his medical services were in the days when they were the only ones today there is about the hospital something amateurish not only because of the doctors insistence that everything should be as elementary as possible but also because of his helpers many women from europe whom he has attracted although they may not be qualified so much for schweitzer why television is a wasteland for negroes by dr william stuart nelson he subject upon which t i have been asked to speak is in my judgment appropriate and timely it cannot be said i believe that higher institutions of learning are playing their full and proper role in affecting the trend of world affairs and if this impression is correct it should be changed it is especially to be regretted if such a criticism can rightly be brought against the colleges here represented it is my thesis that our colleges must break any remaining bonds of insularity and launch into the mainstream of thought pronouncement and action in relation to world trends this view is based upon the conception that college years are years when our young men and women are being ushered out of adolescence into adulthood are seeking a whole view of human affairs and are preparing themselves to participate in the complete life let us concede that during college years much remains to be done in the shoring up process history and even life today have been unkind to many of our students and there remains the urgency of overcoming weaknesses in fundamentalsin reading writing and arithmetica task which the colleges will neglect at their peril this task the student must perform out of time and energy which youth not so shackled can employ in response to their personal tastes this obligation of remedying defects of earlier training must never be confused however with the true purpose of the college institutions of higher learning have among others two basic roles first to prepare their graduates for vocational and professional responsibilities and second to prepare them for their places as members of the larger society as responsible citizens of their country and of the world it is with this second obligation that i shall begin that is the obligation to educate for responsible citizenship we have not always been alert to this role the greeks placed a proper value on this responsibility indeed in greek cities where democracy prevailed those who did not participate in the life of the community were called idiots the kind of college we need today in relation to world trends is one that helps the student grasp the crucial facts about the modern world including the central importance to our lives of the nonwestern world it is disappointing to see the distinguished educator dr oliver c carmichael commend an arts curriculum which includes only the basic concepts of the graecoroman world together with the judeachristian history literature and philosophy the fact is that we are all at this moment tied irrevocably to the asian and african communities whose cultures are also ancient and rich no man can call himself educated or prepared to stand in judgment upon modem world trends unless he brings to that judgment some solid acquaintance for example with the ancient cultures of china of india of africa including their contributions to philosophy religion art science and government until a few years ago we were left to learn about this area of our world by sheer happenstance and then not in the schools our colleges which do not repair swiftly their weaknesses in this respect will fail their students perilously a second fact which the college student must grasp today is that he lives in a revolutionary world perhaps the most farreaching and significent period of social revolution in all history men speak of the eastwest struggle the confrontation of the communist and the free worldby subtle implication the slave and the free world what faces us however is a world revolution begun in russia against a czarist and ecclesiastical regime and continuing more recently in the form of an ineluctable nationalism sweeping across the horizons of south asia and africa especially striking is the fact that for centuries western european countries held in colonial bondage the people of a large part of the worlds surface the sun never set on the british empire during the past fifteen years this picture has changed one experience of my life shall never forget it is that of midnight on august when i witnessed in india the ceremony marking the passing of the ruling power from the hands of the british to those of three hundred and fifty million indians everyone will remember his excitement on the day ghana in became free and attest to his deep satisfaction as one after another of the african states moved from colonial to a selfgoverning status today wherever there is suppression there is also the spirit of revolt it may now be in the smouldering stage if however suppression continues there is a question only of the day and the hour when the will to be free will burst into flames a third fact in relation to world trends is the search by wise and deeply concerned men for the discovery of a moral and spiritual force equal to the problems of a one world and a revolutionary world scientific advance in the field of armaments has accentuated this search so eminent an american as james reston washington correspondent of the new york times has expressed his concern as follows for perhaps the first time in history reflective men have to grapple with the pacifist question can national interests and human values really be served by waging a war with atomic and hydrogen weapons the washington post in a recent editorial discussed the tragic possibility of the destruction by modern weaponry of the irreplaceable genetic material in the human race and declared that our thinking today must rise to a plane as far above that of the past as modem weapons are above the cave mans club that wise men are seeking a new solution to our world tensions and are turning their eyes in the direction of a moral and spiritual solution is encouraging the tragedy lies in the fact that a power equal to our unhappy state has long been available only to be praised and forthwith ignored i refer to the great principle of the universal ethic the meaning of which is that men are brothers children of one creator each possessing a likeness to his father god chief albert luthuli of south africa is a dramatic example of the cementing power of a spirit dedicated to the removal of human injustice by the activist though nonviolent pressures brought to bear courageously and persistently upon the consciences of the south african agents of a ruthless suppression sentenced to confinement in his native village chief luthuli was lifted into world eminence by his selection two years ago as the recipient of the nobel peace prize here is a happy illustration of the moral influence upon the world mind and conscience of a quality of thinking and acting which can lift us far above the present level of fear and conflict the picture of the college which i wish to see is one then which leads its students to comprehend these facts of life that our world is not a western world and an eastern world is but one world each portion of which is capable of enriching the life of the other that our world is in revolution and that no man can play his proper role without understanding this and acting in the light of that understanding and that in answer to the question as to where we shall find the power to redress the balance between the haves and the have nots the weak and the powerful we can look to the possibilities of a force lifted up in recent years for the world to see by such spirits as mahatma gandhi martin_luther_king and chief albert luthuli to the responsibility of guiding students in the interpretation of the major facts of our modern world the college has the duty of developing the spirit of objectivity in their interpretation to contribute constructively to the solution of world problems even in a small way men must be guided by a spirit divorced from blind hemispheric national and racial loyalties freed from servile political affiliation and committed to the employment of those forces available in man himself we live and teach today necessarily under some restriction there is a difference however between living on the frontier of ones restrictions on the one hand and on the other of living and acting well within those frontiers where the risks are minimum living on the frontier of course requires conviction and courage i emphasize this point of courage in our colleges for we as a people live at a juncture in history where great decisions are required of us we are a people who have suffered at the hands of power vested in the greedy the mean the morally perverse and the politically timid we are an emerging people the kind of people we are destined to become rests to a large degree on the kind of graduates we send into the world i am arguing here therefore that the kind of image our colleges present to the world should not be one of qualifying students for a prosaic ab or bs what i have in mind is not on merely the mastering the facts about our world about which i have spoken i am deeply concerned with the developing college generations which will be seized with the thirst for truth and the courage to speak and act upon it we as a people are on the threshold of political power which can prove determinative on a world basis let us hope that many of our college students of today will be the political leaders of tomorrow if for no reason other than that we have suffered so grievously at the hands of the political demagogue supporting his social and racial prejudices our colleges should be willing to pay the price it costs to develop a future generation of responsible honest free political leaders let us compare a mississippi in a james meredith situation under its present political leadership with that under the leadership of a future generation with the moral courage of the student editor at the university of mississippi who recently stood her ground and spoke the truth as she saw it in the presence of the harassments of her fellow students we have before us here two entirely different worlds i come now to the obligation of the college to prepare students for vocational and professional opportunities even obligations in relation to world affairs including those where the element of service is central fortunately the opportunities in this area are increasing several years ago the president of howard university and i were invited to discuss with officials of the department of state the means by which a greater number of qualified negro college graduates might be encouraged to take the foreign service examinations more recently i was visited by a department of state official on this same mission concern i know is being felt by our colleges and a careful search is being made for a solution to this problem with some regularity now we read or hear of significant appointments to positions in the foreign service which have included three on the ambassadorial level the peace corps presses for more applications from our colleges with the expressed possibility that peace corps experience may serve as a stepping stone to appointments in the foreign service attractive opportunities are also increasing in other than government service technical competence is being sought at an accelerated pace by private companies engaged in expanding developmental operations overseas such competence is now being sought in our own institutions unhappily the positions available in the educational institutions of newly independent countries are greater in number than can presently be filled by competently trained personnel among us as we all know there has been the dedicated achievement of education for negroes in assisting newly emerging freedmen to acquire those skills enabling them to use their freedom responsibly equally meritorious has been the effort of our colleges to equip their graduates with those professional skills with which to meet the demands of a highly restricted community it can be said that this education ad ministered and received under conditions with which we all are acquainted has been of such quality as to mark an heroic epoch in the higher education of negroes but the walls of restriction are being slowly broken down no longer is the professional and technical skill of the negro in demand alone within the confines of a restricted community his talents are being eagerly sought on a world scale this fact calls for a basic reexamination of our college curricula and a questioning of the continuing exclusive emphasis upon traditionalism we shall continue to train doctors lawyers ministers teachers with a thoroughness that will make them second to none at the same time we must be alert to the vastly increasing categories of skills and vocational opportunities which will be available to the graduates of the s little dreamed of a few years ago this means that for years to come given the realities within which we live there will be a large although decreasing need for our education to minister to special deficiencies in our students preparation it is to be hoped however that this special obligation will with impressive speed give way so that our curricula may be conceived on a basis sufficiently broad to meet the demands of a world where competence not color will be the overriding criterion in this new preparation for our students we must bear in mind the obligation to help them identify themselves intimately with the people they may be destined to serve and with their needs thus the wider opportunity beckons our problem is to answer it in quality and in quantity we here know the problems our college students face the sacrifices attendant upon getting to college and finishing the urgent need for proceeding upon professional preparation for getting to work parents are exhausted and need support marriage beckons or having already been entered upon cries for steady employment all this and more the hard fact of life however is that while the world may recognize our problems it cannot by any miracle solve them our past and the liabilities it has laid upon us are a part of the present with which we must deal nor do we wish that society lower its standards to suit our situation in short the burden is upon both to press for wider opportunities and to qualify for those presently at our door the call is for still more sacrifice to add to that of our already one hundred years of freedom for harder work than the average less play than the rule for sterner self discipline in brief the call is for the heroic and the colleges in my view are the places supremely to instill this ideal and to summon our youth to embrace it the boston story by james r phillips ate on the night of f t l december young negro folk singja er jack washington ii i was walking along a boston street minding his own business when suddenly two boston police officers stopped him and insisted that he submit to a search of his person the reason given they suspected he might be carrying tools to pry open parking meters they admitted that they had no reason to suspect him and so negro digest june washington a student at emerson college refused to submit to such an invasion of privacy according to a charge sworn out later by washington under oath the policemen brutally assaulted him he was badly banged up and the physical appearance of the two policemen substantiated their counter complaints that he had rendered quite a good account of himself before being subdued up until now it might sound like this is quite a setback for the cause of civil liberties for negroes but wait there is more almost immediately bostons highly influential republican news paperthe prestigious boston heraldblasted the boston police with a powerful lead editorial that proclaimed there is here the question of whether the police officers by their own unwitting admission violated washingtons constitutional right to be free from unreasonable search of his person the officers told the court that they needed to search washington to determine if he had meterbreaking tools in his pocket he did not but the abroadinthenight statute under which they stopped him for questioning does not authorize any such search for evidence nor could it constitutionally all searches are unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional unless they are made with a search warrant or incident to a lawful arrest the police had no warrant to search washington and he was not arrested until after he was searched and then for an offense other than that for which the search was conducted the assault charge was substituted later it is necessary that lawabiding citizens be able to go abroad at night without being subject to arbitrary search and even assault and battery let the trial board hearings on the policemens conduct proceed here is the kind of prompt community demand for the equal protection of negro civil_rights that is now becoming commonplace in boston and it is typical of the exciting new gains being registered by negroes in boston in recent weeks three other developments of major importance to negroes have unfolded in boston here they are item negro lawyer edward w brooke former chairman of the boston finance commission was elected to the powerful post of attorneygeneral of massachusetts the only republican to survive a democratic sweep led by the presidents brother the nowsenator teddy kennedy item negro rt rev john m burgess was consecrated suffragan bishop of the protestant episcopal diocese of massachusetts the first time a negro has been elevated to such an important position in a predominantly white protestant episcopal community he has vowed to work for greater social justice in racial matters item such negro leaders as mrs muriel snowden director of the famed freedom house were credited with having played a major planning role as the city revealed plans for a sweeping public and private renewal program in the heavily negropopulated roxbury district of boston these three rapidfire developments are actually quite consistent with bostons early traditions boston itself was created in by a large and wellfinanced expedition of nonconforming protestant dissenters from england the leaders of this group included some of englands richest and best educated men they founded harvard college almost immediately to make sure that the infant settlement would be guaranteed a steady supply of leaders to carry on their traditions the major concerns of these early settlers were housing religion and lawsironically the same three areas in which major breakthroughs have just come for negroes in boston the breakthroughs themselves merely reflect a rebirth of the progressive ideals brought to the new world by those early setlers bostons biggest export in its early days was its moral conscience but for many years yankee bostons old nonconformist and revolutionary traditions seemed to be buried under the customs of newcomers now a definite rebirth of the traditional boston spirit has occurred circumstantial evidence hints at the possibility that the negroes arriving from the south mostly as were the original settlers protestants seeking individual liberty and equal opportunity have contributed importantly to this renaissance in boston but whatever the cause it is a fact that the old spirit of liberty has been rekindled in what had become stuffy and conservative bostonso much so that boston newspapers radio stations and tv stations have begun using the phrase the new boston to describe the exciting new spirit now sweeping through the city it may be expected that this boston spiritwhich aims at lifting negroes up to full equality will spread and have national effects the most obvious place to look for national effects of the new boston spirit is in the federal government president kennedy who is himself a bostonian has already issued an executive order banning discrimination in certain federally aided housing it may be expected that he will seek more civil_rights legislation and it is likely that he will be far more successful in this now with bostons own congressman john mccormick as powerful speaker of the house than he might have been with speaker sam rayburn from segregationist texas but the boston spirit is hardly confined to government activity indeed the tradition of boston from the first nonconforming setlers through the revolution was sharply antibig government far more important is the subtle but decisive influence the citys spirit has on anyone who comes into contact with it private individuals moving into positions of leadership in nongovernment activities can do far more good through moral leadership than mere laws can do by themselves take for example rev martin_luther_king coming from georgia he studied at the divinity school of big private and protestantbacked boston university when he won his graduate degree a few years ago he went back down south he had been greatly influenced by his experiences in the new boston his work since then in organizing the first really successful negroled drive for equal rights in the south is widely known but less widely known is the role that bostons spiritual traditions played in shaping this man there will undoubtedly be many more cases of indirect influence by boston on todays accelerating drive towards equal rights for negroes in the nation as a whole as proof of this likelihood you need only consider these past examples of how major social and moral movements bom in traditionally nonconformist boston quickly spread to embrace the nation the old north christ episcopal church was established in boston this church later to be famous because two lanterns were hung in its tower to signal paul revere buried negroes together with whites in its underground vaults it was a bold move for its time showing as it did a belief in multiracial social equality defense attorney james otis jr stunned his feuow boston citizens as he proclaimed during a key testcase trial before the british admiralty court that all men are born with natural rights of libertyand that no king or parliament can legally take away these equal rights the implications of the speech were immediately apparent to all concerned carried to their logical conclusion such views would render illegal not only imperial restrictions on shipping but also slavery as well a free negro sailor named crispus attucks was shot down in cold blood by british troops in the boston massacre he was the first american to die in what history later showed was really the opening skirmish of our revolutionary war the massachusetts supreme court outlawed slavery because of the words in the states bill of rights which stated all men are born free and equal a new century dawned and the fever of reform suddenly swept boston again veterans of battles at lexington concord and bunker hill began agitating for the abolition of slavery their slogan became we fought for freedom of all men black as well as white crusading editor william lloyd garrison established a newspaper in boston devoted to prompting abolition mounting interest in this cause led to the formation of the first abolition society in boston in a year later spreading interest led to the formation of other societies and then a national abolition society flaming speeches against slavery began drawing large crowds to boston auditoriums a young whig lawyer from illinois abe lincoln by name visited boston and heard an evening of abolitionist speeches lincoln up till then a fencesitting moderate noted for his logic found his lifes emotional cause he was to be totally won over to the abolitionist movement later he joined the new republican party and his extreme views won him the label of black republican upon his election to the presidency southern states immediately began seceding from the union his civil war victory fulfilled bostons abolitionist cause following the civil war boston underwent a transformation after years of leadership in the cause of liberty it sank into a conservatism that at times bordered on being reactionary the onceprogressive yankees fighting to hold their power against rising tides of irish jewish and italian immigrants seemed to forget their proud heritage as guardians of americas most exciting traditionsnonconformity dissent revolution and abolition but then more recently a seeming miracle occurred an unspoken truce was declared in the battles between old yankee and new immigrant stock perhaps it was the pleas for social justice from the small but growing negro community but at any rate something pricked bostons conscience catholics protestants and jews began burying their antagonisms yankees irish italians jews chinese and negroes began joining together in seeking to build a new boston the newness was visible to the naked eye in the form of new buildings but even more significant was the newness not visible to the eye this was a new spiritan electric feeling that one could only sense crackling through the air now this new spiritreally a very old spirit come back home to boston againis bringing very real gains to negroes late in it was the election of attorneygeneral brooke the elevation of rt rev burgess and the announcement of coming major improvements in housing opportunities it may be expected that will see further significant gains and it is possibleeven probablethat negroes in boston will make more progress towards full equality in the next ten years than in the last hundred years put together new leaders are arising leaders in the tradition of james otis jr crispus attucks and william lloyd garrison there is bound to be opposition from some stubborn individuals just as there was a minority opposition in boston to such earlier movements as the revolution and abolition but history showsespecially the history of movements bora in bostonthat once a new spirit of liberty and justice is loose in a community it can never again be contained and it will ultimately triumph if the history of earlier bostonborn movements is any guide the recent major gains for negroes in boston presage total equality of opportunity for negroesfirst in boston and then in the nation as a whole forgotten by gerard f kenney h youre wearing two ties delightedly little fouryearold lillian toyed with the two ends of the visitors deep down inside the visitor felt a sharp twinge of pain strangely his eyes smarted for a moment it just wasnt possible to avoid the emotion that came with the realization that this lovely wideeyed youngster has yet to have the opportunity to enjoy such simple things as playing with her fathers necktie fingering his cufflinks listening to the tick of his watch across the hall a young nurse rushed into a room to pick up and cuddle chunky little monthold alfred her practiced eye had spotted little a starting to rock himself back and forth in his crib the usual preliminary when lonesome infants deprived of the real love they need are about to start hitting their heads against the side of their crib a few feet away at a tiny table and chairs three bright delightful youngsters about two to three years of age were having lunch the table presided over by even cuter fouryearold norma norma had volunteered to help the nurses by helping the youngsters eat their lunch her reward a feeling of importance of being neededand a lollypop these are just a few of the forgotten per cent these are just a few of the hundreds of infants in new york foundling hospital third avenue new york city they are but a tiny representation of the more than youngsters in homes and orphanges across the united statesyoungsters whose yesterdays todays and tomorrows hold little in the way of hope for them to achieve real contentment real happiness a real home life these in this nursery are some of the more than negro youngsters whose futures are in serious doubt today for somehow beyond all understanding in these days of great concern for equality individual liberty social welfare and human rights the plight of these children seems to have escaped the notice and concern of almost everyone except a compara tively small number of dedicated professional men and women and social workers true these untiring people try diligently desperatelyand succeed in a good measure to make institutional life substitute for the warmth and love that only a foster home can offer but equally true children even as the birds and animals of the woodsare given parents at birth parents to help them teach them develop them to love them until they are sufficiently strong to face the world around them this is simply a natural law how then can the staffs of the childrens institutions be expected to fulfill the parents roles why should these temporary guardians be left with the impossible problem of trying to be to these youngsters something they cannot never were intendedto be the real tragedy of these beautiful foundling infants and toddlers is the fact that specialists in the field of child care and placement have determined that unless these children are placed in private foster homes by the age of four they are almost certain to endure an institutional life until they reach legal age for the sad proven fact is that having lived an institutional life from birth a child older than four years of age has lived with institutional routines and constantly changing nursing shifts and social worker staffs for so long that he many times accepts the feeling that he doesnt belong to anyone that somehow he is different when this occurs he automatically defensively shuts out the world at large and placement in a foster home can produce an emotional shock which could have a profound effect upon the youngsters entire future life and thinking these facts may come as a surprise to some readers an even greater surprise may be this many people think the youngsters in institutions are there because no one wants to adopt them but the fact is of the institutional population of more than children only two per cent are available for adoption ninetyeight per cent of the children are not subject to adoption for some legal reason they are wholly dependent upon the authorities who help to shelter them their destinies until adulthood are almost drab and hopeless unless prospective foster parents come forth and open their hearts and their homes to the children walk into the immaculately clean bright cheerful nurseries of new york foundling hospital or any other childrens home or hospital look at the cherubic lovable fouryearolds like norma how great the tragedy that at their ripe old age time is running out for them time and the golden opportunity for a carefree child hood full of family friends sunshine and the many other vital necessities of childhood realize for a moment that these are just a few more names in the roster of the forgotten per cent lend a hand for a moment to help little threeyearold jack out of his snowsuit the nurse has just returned him after a minute walk in the world of roaring automobiles exciting street noises gaily dressed people romping neighborhood childrenthe world of young people with hopeful futures watch jack walk off as he tries to find a new interest which in the confines of the nursery can help him retain the excitement and pleasure of his short outing into the wonderful world outside everything that can be done is being done for these youngsters by skilled social workers nurses doctors psychologists and psychiatrists child welfare agencies and volunteers but nothing can be a substitute for the love the warmth the affection and understanding that children such as these can receive from foster mothers and foster fathers perhaps the most dramatic evidence of the great difference between the institution and the foster home comes as the sun sets and day turns to night stand at the end of the corridor in new york foundling hospital as the good sisters of charity and crisp warmhearted nurses tuck in for the night the tiny tenants of nursery f now listen a plaintiff cry comes from tommy in one corner of the nursery a whimper from little jeanie in another corner a sob from little marian in another section of the nursery the head nurse knows that these few little cries in the dimly lighted nursery can upset the rest of the youngsters and cause a babble of heartrending cries and sobbing she moves silently swiftly from one end of the corridor to the other flicking switches on machines strategically placed at each end what are the machines they are sonotone securitones what do they do they reproduce and amplify throughout the nursery the recorded sound of the beat of a mothers heart this then must suffice to put the children at ease this must substitute for the loving caress of a foster mothers hand must pacify as would a softly crooned mothers lullaby can it be that many tens of thousands of lovable youngsters like these face a life confinement to institutions is it possible that so many capable couples across the nation fail to realize the wealth the treasure the happiness and fulfillment that these infants and toddlers can bring into their home is it not the greatest of ironies that child welfare agencies across the nation search desperately day and night to find foster homes for these infants who offer so much and yet the authorities are forced to admit that the results of their efforts are disheartening the irony these agencies are offering to prospective foster parents to and sometimes more in monetary allowance for each youngster taken in plus medical care and clothing yet sadly sufficient numbers of prospective foster parents fail to come forward for every ounce of common sense and human feeling would dictate that prospective foster parents would outnumber the children many times over qualifications for foster parents are simple in essence the couple need be only normal compassionate human beings they need not have a college education nor a higher income than their neighbors whether or not they have children of their own is unimportant nor is age an important factor for information regarding foster parents or volunteer work with foundling agencies address

comedian musician drums vibes trumpet guitaryou name it hell play it and the fastest gun in hollywood also for a considerable period of time he was the most controversial entertainment personality in

highest price ever paid anybody there its an exciting deal i want to work steadily this year and next so that i can go into golden boy on broadway i make a week but when i go on broadway ill drop down to perhaps a week by fletcher e dalton possibly in order to appease certain groups agencies and individuals the television networks have recently caused a rash of negro performers to be seen on our screens mainly on major programs at prime viewing hours these guests have been a welcome sight and on one or two dramatic shows have given praiseworthy accounts of themselves this trend cannot last however because the persons chosen have all been famous and prominent personalities whose major careers lie well outside the regular scope of television lena horne dorothy dandridge sammy davis jr ray charles leontyne price mahalia jackson nor can this type of appearance satisfy those who long for more representation of the negro in the areas of television that are less spectacular guest appearances on variety programs panel shows chitchat hoursfrequently at fantastic pricesmay be a good beginning but certainly not the final objective what is desired it seems to me is less representation at the showcase or entertainment level and more representation at what might be called for lack of a better term the functional levels of television its commercial and educational areas more regulars than itinerants is one way of stating the problem television has used to advantage lately albeit with some timidity the area in which itinerants can be of significant value that is the area of acting in the halfhour and hourlong dramatic series in these negro actors have appeared in roles of doctor nurse teacher social worker policeman soldier and sometimes merely as a decently dressed passerby the one drawback is the fact that almost without exception these bit parts are taken by outstanding negro actors and actresses whose previous achievements on stage and screen are head and shoulders above those of their tv colleagues what for instance is ossie davis doing in car where are you i am not familiar with statistics on the availability in this country of negro actors and actresses but i am sure they number more than the half dozen or so players we see tossed about from one network to another in the course of a year someone pointed out to me that we cannot have our cake and eat it too that either we must have walkon parts with dignity and silence or have major roles and be garrulous and obsequious a la beulah and amos and andy would that our indignation at remarks of this kind could be passed on to tv writers leaving this area which is solving its own problems with all deliberate speed i should like to suggest the use of the negro potential in the commercial and educational areas of television areas as yet untouched and unexplored perhaps because unsought by us here it must be made plain that i speak as an observer only with no inside knowledge of the complexities of television commercialism i am concerned with what i along with several million other people see or do not see daily on my television screen advertising the principle of separate but equal has long been a part of american advertising as the annals of several negro magazines can attest a partial list of the products which advertise in magazines supposedly reaching only the negro community yet which are major sponsors or advertisers on television follows beverages cocacola pepsicola pabst schlitz millers toothpastes crest ipana gleem cigarettes kent winston viceroy salem lucky strike chesterfield foods kraft pet milk nabisco sealtest campbells transportation greyhound goodyear firestone general motors ford beauty products helene curtis maybelline ponds the above list was compiled from one issue of a national negro magazine each product is a constant television advertiser it should be noted that only those products are mentioned whose television commercials are in decent if not in good taste which automatically excludes certain personal items which have lately run rampant on our screens and alcoholic beverages which of course are not allowed television advertising each of these products is promoted by a negro in the magazines the commercial is exactly the same as it appears on the screen except for the exclusion of whites and the inclusion of negroes i am sure that for an occasional commercial this principle could work as well on the inch screen as in magazines the negro market is increasing constantly at a rather rapid rate and the business world is quite aware of this a selective buying campaign directed against those commercials which are twofaced would bring tangible results quickly enough things need not come to that pass however since commercials lately pretend to be unrehearsed natural and as american as apple pie catching housewives at work ordinary laborers in moments of relaxation picnickers and other happy unsuspecting subjects negroes are as available for this sort of advertising as anybody else each company of any size and importance has several commercials which alternate certainly one or two of these could utilize a negro or negroes especially for such products as beverages cigarettes private cars telephones and the wide range of home products may they spare us from the general quality of detergent commercials however which has reached an alltime low speaking of detergent commercials there was once a product in which a negro promoted the qualities of her favorite laundry soap or starch or whatever she was discovered ironing as the commercial progressed however it became clear that she was ironing for miss somebody who never failed to congratulate her on how soft her sheets felt miss whoeveritwas could never get them that clean herself it goes without saying that this bit of objectionable advertising was soon withdrawn i advocate its reappearance with a new emphasis that the negro woman mrs is in her own home ironing her own laundry for the benefit of her own family like millions of housewives do daily the world over with or without a dog named siegfried news two of the three major television networks have recently hired one negro reporter each bully for them newscasting and interviewing are major functions of television for regular reporting of the news of the day the minute segments between and pm the nation expects and currently has certain permanent newscasters there is reason to desire the employment of a negro eventually to read off the headlines during the midmorning and midafternoon abbreviated news segments negro reporters are desperately needed where and when national and local events have made interviews with negro citizens necessary this is especially true in crises real or anticipated resulting from problems of desegregation north and south no doubt many of us are almost driven to despair when the typical white interviewer approaches one of our brave standard bearers and asks after momentary embarrassing hesitation were you put up to this by the naacp or in the case of students who have been attending colleges and universities with token integration who have been your best friends male or female students or the most mistaken and yet most insidious of all just what did you hope to gain by all this this is not responsible reporting and certainly does not get that rapport between interviewer and interviewee which is desirable there are in this country excellent negro researchers reporters photographers capable of handling with all ease and effectiveness documentaries of many types particularly those which deal with our own segment of the population we should press strongly for their employment and use by the major television networks there are other areas in this medium where the employment of negroes would be a national asset educational television is one it is strange that national educational television which does not have even that patched and constantly ravelling skirt of southern opposition which as they grow up the commercial networks seek to hide behind less and less utilizes the negro to such a small extent i have yet to see a negro instruct a class for credit via educational tv and yet what are we if not teachers national educational television the one medium in the nation best equipped to dispel the notion that the negro is not under the spell of the bad fairy and is condemned to sing and dance himself into oblivion is tacitly promoting that fiction in short then this vast wastelandincluding both its commercial and educational networks could use some of its neglected human potential to create oases designed for the mutual comfort and uplifting of us all toward a goal of full racial justice by the most rev lawrence j shehan dd catholic archbishop of baltimore md christ in the month of november the bishop of this country at their annual meeting issued a statement entitled discrimination and the christian conscience after noting the rather remarkable progress made by our negro fellow citizens particularly during and after the second world war toward such goals as political equality fair edcational and economic opportunities good housing without exploitation and a full chance for social advancement the bishops went on to say that in more recent years the issues have become confused and the march toward justice and equality has been slowed if not halted in some areas the transcendent moral issues have become obscured and possibly forgotten the heart of the race question they declared is moral and religious it concerns the rights of man and our attitude toward our fellow man if our attitude is governed by the great christian law of love of neighbor and respect for his rights then we can work out harmoniously the techniques for making legal educational economic and social adjustments but if our hearts are poisoned by hatred or even by indifference toward the welfare and rights of our fellow man then our nation faces a grave internal crisis within this household of the faith this temple holy to the lord this dwelling place of god in the spirit this mystical body of christ there can be no room for racial discrimination and the bitterness and rancor that inevitably grow out of it in this year when the minds and hearts of men are turning longingly and hopefully toward the goal of christian unity it is particularly important that justice and charity without any discrimination or prejudice or antipathy should shine brightly within the church of christ there is we knowand there can beonly one center of christian unity christ and his mystical body but how can that body be recognized for what it is unless there is within it unity without division or dissension and unless within and between its members there shine the justice and charity of christ within the time and space available to me in this letter it is impossible to set forth in detail the extent and the nobility of the duty of f justice and charity incumbent upon us as members of christs mystical body under the circumstances m of today however it may be useful if i attempt to state briefly the minimum that is required of us as members of christs church in this archdiocese there is i hope no need to say that in our churches and in our parochial life generally there must be not only no racial segregation but also no distinction of rank or place i or treatment based upon racial difi ference because we are members one of another do not grieve the holy spirit of god in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption ephesians for now the justice of god has been made manifest through faith in jesus christ upon all who believe for there is no distinction as all have sinned and need the glory of god romans in our schools both elementary and secondary the same general policy holds as catholic schools they are meant primarily although not exclusively for catholic studentsfor all catholic students insofar as facilities can be made availablewithout racial or any other discrimination this means that in the registration of students a common policy approved by our catholic school board must be followed in the case of all catholic children living within the boundaries of every parish fortunate enough to have its own school the same policy must govern all transfers from one school to another within the school identical academic standards must apply to all students and all must be treated with equal justice and charity in our diocesan organizations and institutions of charity a sincere effort has been made over a period of years to eliminate discrimination and to effect true integration longstanding social and cultural patterns have at times made this process difficult with the opening of the new st vincents home we believe that the last traces of discrimination in this field will have disappeared it is some months now since all our catholic hospitals gave formal approval and acceptance to the policies of nondiscrimination i specifically proposed this means that they have agreed to admit and treat applicants for medical and surgical service without distinction in their outpatient departments to follow the same procedure in admitting patients into the hospital and in assigning beds to them that there shall be no discrimination practiced in handling applications for membership on medical surgical and nursing staffs that advancement within each staff will be governed only by ability training experience and character that a policy of integration and nondiscrimination is to be effective for all employees of the hospital in older and outmoded hospital plants it has sometimes been difficult to eliminate some customs based on ageold prejudices and social patterns but now that the last of our hospitals is acquiring a modern building we are confident that the final traces of segregation and discrimination will disappear some of these policies have been in effect in each of these fields for a long time we do not claim that any of them go beyond mere justice i have spelled them out in some detail because of questions which have been raised from time to time the duty of justice and charity applies not only to our churches our schools our charitable organizations and institutions and our hospitals but also to all of us as individuals it must guide us in our personal relationshipswithin our block our neighborhood our community in our social and fraternal organizations in the business we may conduct in the labor unions to which we may belong at work and at play in all the circumstances of everyday life particularly lamentable is the unreasonable and automatic panic too often fanned by unscrupulous and disreputable real estate brokers and speculators which accompanies the arrival of a negro family in an area previously occupied by white families only the flight that occurs not only unfairly prejudges the new neighbors but it also works an economic hardship on departing property owners destroys the community undermines church life and hits hard at substantial investments made in schools rectories convents and recreational facilities as well as in the actual places of worship nor can we afford to overlook the crippling effect that division and dissension within our community have on our efforts to meet what is perhaps the most alarming problem of this and every other large city of the country crime this is not the place to go into the sources or causes of crime within our midst suffice it to say that no part or group of our people has a monopoly on those sources or causes what should concern us is that the problem is so great as to call for the best minds and the combined intense and persistent efforts of the ablest leaders of all elements within the community in saying this we reflect in no way on the police force of either city or state on the contrary we have complete confidence in the integrity and ability of both the heads and the ranks of our police departments but this problem is one that requires the continuing scrutiny and efforts of the community as a whole it will not be met adequately if there is dissension division suspicion between the two chief racial groups of our citizens even to enumerate our present duties and policies brings vividly to our minds our past defects those defects we frankly admit with humility and regret we catholics must acknowledge that we have been all too slow in the correction of our shortcomings although in the light of the experience of many of our forefathers we should have been particularly sensitive to the unjust inequalities suffered by other groups for this reason we have a special obligation to place ourselves in the forefront of movements to remove the injustices and discriminations which still remain we are all aware of the present grave social problems which have had their origin in racial prejudices and tensions and which are fed by longstanding racial antipathies these problems cannot be suddenly solved or wiped out by wishful thinking or good intentions they are community problems they therefore cannot be successfully met by any one part of the community nor any one group however highminded and earnest they call for the combined thought and planning and cooperation of all of us they require patience and understanding and good will and persistent effort on the part of everyone they call for a sense of justice above all in that part of the community in which the evil had its origin and a spirit of charity on both sides in their statement the bishops of this country while calling for concrete plans for the elimination of discrimination and the establishment of equal justice and opportunities urged that such plans be based upon prudence the virtue which inclines us to view problems in their proper perspective the problems we inherit today they noted are rooted in decades even centuries of custom and cultural patterns when we are confronted with complex and farreaching evils it is not a sign or weakness or timidity to weigh carefully the proposed remedies and reforms some changes are more necessary than others some may be easy to achieve others may seem impossible at a given time it is the mark of wisdom rather than of weakness to study problems fully and to form plans carefully prudence will indeed guard against the rashness which may endanger solid accomplishmentbut prudence must never serve as an excuse for inaction or unnecessary gradualism or as a reason for not holding a straight steady course toward our goal of full justice uncle tom abroad by julian mayfield difficult to recognize in africa than he is at home i refer here to the north american genus of the specieshomo tomo americanus this type of tom is u often a technician of some sort in africa on a two or three year contract on the payroll of the u s government or a private firm frequently he is a scholar or a writer who is merely passing through on a lecture or a study tour sponsored by the state department or one of the many wealthy foundations at home you can easily identify the average tom by the way he relates to the white world whether a day laborer college president clerk or scientist he has been convinced by the enormity and seeming indomitability of white power that he and his kind are indeed inferior beings prudence and common sense dictate to him that he should do everything he can to remain on good terms with the master race toms philosophy is dont rock the boat but to isolate the genus here in africa requires keen perception when he alights at the airport tom becomes first and foremost an american abroad with all that that implies he carries himself with a confidence unknown to him at home and he is always on important business he wishes to see the president or the prime minister immediately if he has traveled much he is on a first name basis with all the african leaders i told kwame that i thought he should jomo met me at the airport and we had a drink together julius asked me for my advice about how can one help but be impressed another thing that makes it difficult to identify homo tomo americanus in africa is that here he is always a radical back home you could probably not get his signature for a petition defending the right of women to have babies but once on african soil he becomes a vociferous advocate of socialism not even lowering his voice or looking over his shoulder one also detects in tom a vein of militancy he never displayed at home to listen to him talk at a party or over dinner one imagines that tom would if he had his way singlehandedly set to rout all the white settlers and drench the continent in their blood if someone is unkind enough to point out to tom that this is strange talk coming from someone who works for the u s embassy which means they must be certain that he is safe or that his tour is being financed by white foundation money tom laughs without the least hint of embarrassment he looks at you with pity and amusement in his eyes as if you are out of touch with what is going on back home among the really hep negroes of his group yes he says it is true that he is on their payroll but he is not with them he knows what those white soandsos are trying to do in africa and that they are trying to use him tom because of his black skin butand here tom usually winks at youhe is smarter than all of them the state department the u s intelligence services the foundations the african study groups etc tom actually believes or at least he wants you to believethat he is taking their money while at the same time he is helping to promote the african revolution but there is one certain way of identifying homo tomo americanus in africa he never does or says anything that might annoy the local u s embassy thus however militant he may sound in private he can never publicly give a straight answer to a simple question about american racialism at one of toms lectures for example if he is asked to comment on the spectacle of mr merediths rather noisy enrollment at ole miss tom replies yes it was shameful but the important thing is that meredith got in thats progress but he is asked why didnt president kennedy use the occasion to teach the morality of human equality to the nation instead of merely pleading with the white students to obey the law well you see says ambassador tom who values his passport highly who likes the idea of being an international traveler and who knows that there is always in the audience an agent from the local embassy recording everything he says mr kennedy has many problems and let me say right now that i think this administration is doing everything it can to eliminate discrimination poor tom for all of his apparent sophistication he lacks sensitivity he returns home now an expert on africa to write his articles and give lectures unaware that he has been the object of derision and contempt for most informed africans have no illusions about american racial problems even more regrettable is the fact that while traveling through this continent of revolt where millions of people are crawling stumbling and pushing forward toward a better life tom did not draw the obvious conclusion the conclusion that thousands of young black americans are reaching every day that the only way to make progress in a situation of oppression is to rock the boat and to rock it with such violence that either it sinks or it becomes a decent place in which to live and his world of a painter walter sanford has evolved through a periods marked by the unique energy and enthusiasm that the man brings to his work and to his life currently he is involved in what he terms a return to realism and the canvases being turned out in his chicago studio have the boldness and vigor associated with the great mexican painters david siqueiros and diego rivera the influence is at least partly a reflection of sanfords mexican period a time of his life he regards as having been both especially happy and productive most people who know sanford think of him as being quite a character and even the artist labels himself something of a clown but then he goes on to explain you can escape a lot of hardship by clowninglike bessie smith used to sing i laugh to keep from crying in any event sanford possesses an outlook and attitude as bold as his painting style and as winning it is instructive to talk to him and exciting to watch him work my art is as rough as funky jazz he says it reflects the tempo the beat of the times currently sanford is working on a series of portraits of real and imaginary figures with such titles as the politician the philosopher and the policeman they are notas one glance will indicate merely portraits but portraitsindepth baring the subjects souls in a whimsical moment sanford lured casey jones chicagos famed chicken man who prowls the city with a rooster that does everything but talk into the studio to pose casey claims to be among other things and capturing this innerman on canvas would challenge a michelangelo a native of chicago sanford grew up on the south side a far more romantic place then than it is today in grade school he came under the influence of a miss ryan who had him paint a landscape when he was nine the carter school teacher became his first booster sanford whose wife susan is a teacher says that teachers the philosopher is one of a series of sociological paintings on which sanford is working currently have always strongly influenced his life sanfords formal education ended with high school and his rather scanty formal art education included a year of three evenings a week at chicagos art institute and later a year under famed john carroll at detroits arts and crafts until the artists style was generally expressionistic then caught under the spell of picassos cubism he switched to abstractexpressionism he worked in this style primarily for some years during his sojourn in detroit las vegas mexico and france the return to realism was a step taken early in a year after he had established a new studio in the heart of chicagos near south side across the street from the prairie shoreslake meadows urban housing complex sanford crosses town from his home to his studio daily like any man with a job of work to do disdaining artistic affections he receives friends and customers all day entertains them while he works does all the visiting affect his mood and concentrationi am no beatnik artist sanford laughs i am a painter painting is my life and i can do it anywhere at if i have breath will be painting and there is no reason to doubt that he will sjn sjvnraisai by aral he is known as sanford when he was he sold his first painting this lucky event formed his future right then and there he made up his mind to become an artist and to be known as sanford his wife and close friends find even sanford too long and call him san the first halfcentury of his life proves that his early decision was correct today he who has no first name he who uses no middle name has indeed succeeded as sanford the artist sanford the american considers himself a world citizen he has lived and worked in many spots on the globeeurope mexico and all over the united states now after a year absence he has settled in his native chicago sanfords work proves that he grew with the age undoubtedly his creative talents and masterful techniques have directed him toward the expression of a unique style that is why it is not possible to press him into any specific school or pattern or ism to call sanford an expressionist or an unrealist or a surrealist is both right and wrong he is a mixture of all the established isms like his favorite painter picasso sanford can be judged only by his different periodseach of which reveals the influence of the physical and psychological landscape in which he lived and created take the las vegas nevada period for instance see how the sun the sand the cacti and the coloring of the mountains but certainly the bizarre shapes of deadwood have been transposed thanks to the artists genius blend into the color rhythm of his paintings this period seems to have been the most formative in the development of the artists style sanford must feel this way himself for only a single picture from this period is in his studio all the others are in his home and have never been offered for sale does this mean then that the true sanford is the one of the nevada desert periodit cannot be because there also is his taxco mexico period who ever has set foot on this hidden jewel of mexican beauty will never forget sanfords color symphony from the taxco period this is mexico old mexico and her people abstracted to the essentialsseen with the eyes of a great artist expressed in graphic forms keen composition and bright colors the question arises is this artist a painter specializing in oilsso rash a conclusion could not be more wrong sanfords creativeness is not limited to oils or to landscapes stilllifes or portraits there is sanford the master with the pencil who with a few lines records daily life there is sanford the satyr who with sharp mind and even sharper pen and india ink nails down some hypocritical conceit there is even the master of the linoleumcut and of the woodcut an almost forgotten art only recently did sanford carve his own image into tough oak there is even sanford the sculptor this artist is at ease and at home in so many fields of artistic expression artistic media and techniques that it is impossible to put the finger on the one true sanford yet having been privileged to watch the gradual development of one of his latest works from the conception in red into a finished masterpiece in blue let me talk for a moment about an oil study for which the artist selected the name the philosopher this painting reveals the maturity of a man who reaches beyond the stage of being a graphic artist painted without a model sanfordhimself a member of a minority group has created the head of a member of another minority group the image of a jewish dreamer who speaks with his divine master sanford has created a face that smiles as only those continued on page the wasted reservoir by hobart taylor jr t was one hundred years ago that abraham lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation this move essentially a wartime necessity represented one of the most unusual and daring steps taken in history people who had been regarded as chattelcommodities to be bought or sold on the open market like cotton molasses or rum were suddenly granted their freedom without preparation without adequate advance planning and without the agreement of that section of our country in which the most slaves were owned it was a revolutionary stroke which shook the foundations of our society it created problems both north and south it undoubtedly aided the union forces both in the united states and in americas relations with other nationswhich in the period when the british government had some disposition to intervene in the conflict was a crucial point furthermore it was a move that was morally right and it is a sad commentary that it took a war to place into effect an overriding moral principle the historical accounts differ as to how the slaves themselves greeted the emancipation proclamation the observers then on the scene were so caught up in the frenzied emotions of the bitterest war in our history that few of the contemporary accounts are reliable the romantic concept that the slaves by and large were happy people wellfed and pampered and did not want to leave old massa are obviously arrant nonsense the concept that the newfound freedom went to their heads and they became drunk with power is widespread but has been disputed by eminent historians no doubt the first reaction was one of great joy and an exultant mood of deliverance but the joy and the mood of deliverance must have faded quickly when the realization sank in that what the slaves had been granted was not freedomexcept in a legal sensebut the opportunity to march on the road to freedom if americans have learned anything in the last hundred years it is that the emancipation proclamation did not make men free what it really did was to remove some of the barriers that prevented men from striving to be free this point became apparent quickly when the negro tried to fit himself into the economic life of our country under a structure in which the base of all southern societyslaveryhad been removed he had no idea of what he was supposed to do or how he was supposed to do it he had no concept of wages or of the labormanagement relationship a few exceptional negroes had somehow managedeven before emancipationto establish themselves as successful businessmen but these were definitely exceptions and managerial skill was virtually missing from the negro community in some parts of the south slaves had been highly trained as skilled mechanics and semitechnicians but the great bulk were field handsmen and women who had nothing to offer but their ability to pick cotton and tobacco and harvest rice all the former slaves knew was that they were free and that there was a vague idea circulating that each family was entitled to acres and a mule the acres and a mule concept has frequently been cited as one of the most ridiculous proposals in our history we forget that at least it represented a programabout the only program that anyone had and if some effort had been made to put it into effect at least the former slaves would have had an economic base which would have permitted participation in our society lacking such a base there was little they could do other than to go on working for old massathis time on the basis of a wage relationship which they did not understand and without old massa being put to the inconvenience of investing capital in them the history of the pursuit of freedom over the last hundred years is in my view largely the narrative of efforts to find the necessary base as a general rule the question of freedom is discussed in dramatic terms such as the right to vote the right to equal justice under the law the right to education the right to free speech and the right to worship as we choose i agree that these are essentials of freedom but i do not think that any of these essentials can be maintained and preserved unless men and women have not only legal guarantees of their rights but the knowledge to take advantage of them and the independent economic position from which they can be exercised without those two essentials rights will exist only on paper we have not really done anything for people if we tell them that they have the right to compete for a a year job when they are precluded from receiving the training that qualifies them for that job we are not doing anything for people when we tell them that they have the right of free speech if their livelihood is entirely dependent upon one employer or a small group of employers we do not do anything for people when we tell them that they have equal rights before the law when they are ignorant of the pro cesses of the law or even of the measures by which a professional advocate can be secured these are the conditions under which negroes have labored for the hundred years since the emancipation proclamation to the extent to which these problems have been mastered freedom has become more of a reality and only a demagog will deny that even though we are far from attaining the goal of complete freedom enormous strides have been made in the century that has passed today i believe that we are on the threshold of one of the most enormous leaps forward that has been made in freedom for the negro in our history this possibility has been opened up by two factors which seem upon superficial examination to be entirely unrelated to the issue of freedom for minority groups those factors are the atomic age and the space age our nation is one which has never before known the true meaning of labor shortage there have been times and there have been places where productive workers could not be obtained when they were desperately needed but these situations were only temporary and affected only a small number of people in the past our manpower problems have been a question of a surplusnot a shortage we are still plagued by surpluses among workers on the lower level of skills the man whose knowledge extends to no instrument more sophisticated than a pick or the woman whose knowledge extends to an instrument no more sophisticated than a mop but in the higher levels of skills the shoe is already pinching and unless drastic steps are taken within the next few years the shortages could have a serious effect on our economic posture the great new industries that have sprung up around atomic energy electronics and the exploration of outer space gobble up trained minds like locusts attacking a wheat field in the huge space installations of the west coast thoughtful and sober men are already discussing the possibility of a time in the foreseeable future when the u s will have to ration brainpower and establish priorities to determine which scientists go to which projects there simply are not enough physicists chemists metallurgists mathematicians engineers and biologists to go around government administrators complain bitterly that young scientists upon whom they lean heavily are snatched up by private industry on the basis of salaries that the government can never match obviously we must find new sources to teachnew people who can be trained in the complex and highly sophisticated techniques that are required to maintain modern industry we can of course squeeze more scientists out of our present student populationbut not many more to find trained minds in the quantities that we need we are going to have to go to a reservoir which now is scarcely touchedthe million americans who are of negro descent i do not want to present this in any oversimplified form we do not have before us a quick and easy path to the millenium we are not going to have overnight the spectacle of laboratories suddenly being staffed with negro scientists we must be frank about it and admit to ourselves candidly that the negro scientists do not exist in such quantities the doors of opportunity are wide open but the negroes who would walk through these doors simply are not prepared to take advantage of this opportunity it will be necessary for us to break a pattern that has been building up for a century and which has become so rigid it can be shattered only by a major effort from negro leaders themselves traditionally the educated negro is a teacher a preacher or a dentist some become lawyers and a few become doctors and of course a number become undertakers or insurance executives it is not surprising that this is the pattern in these professions a negro can make a living out of his fellow negroes without ever touching white society at all he need not fear failure solely because of the color of his skin or his ancestry if he has the ability his success is assured but venturing outside of those professions leads him into a risky world where he must take his chances on attaining success on the basis of the whole societywhite and black for most of the hundred years that have gone by the sciences which now offer such golden opportunities have presented the negro with nothing but the prospect of failure why should a man or woman study physics or chemistry or mathematics when the only conceivable outcome will be a job in a mental capacity so our problem is a double one first we must convince our young people that the old patterns no longer prevail and that an education effort will yield rewards second we must work to see that that education is available and that the colleges which are attended by most negroes do have the necessary facilities that will train them in the skills and the professions of the present and the future my job as executive vice chairman of the equal employment opportunity committee has been enormously complicated by the lack of realistic training for negroes it is difficult enough to combat discrimination that is based upon bigotry or upon outmoded patterns of employment it is much more difficult to attack employment discrimination at its source not denial of the right to a job but denial of the right to train for a job when an industry does not em ploy negroes or other minority groups in certain skills the minority groups quickly lose interest in training therefore when the doors of opportunity are opened nobody is available to walk through them time after time i am told by leaders of large corporations that they are perfectly willing to employ negroesif they can find them in some instances this may well be a mere alibi but i believe that most of them are telling the truth industry needs brains and does not care about the color of those brains industry needs skills and does not care about the ancestry of the people possessing those skills but this process is not going to happen automatically it is going to take thought and care and planning and hard work on the part of negroes themselves i would hope that the organizations in the u s that represent negroes would devote themselves to this problem i would like to see our educators our leaders our businessmen come together to plan and to work to change the patterns of negro education and of the negro economy we are past the point where the negro economy can or should live apart from the white economy we are past the point where the only road to success for a negro is by making a living out of his fellow negroes the negro writer in america introductory remarks one of the things about being an artist is that you are produced by a people because they need you but the people who produce you do not want you this is not a complaint this is simply a statement of fact i suppose that the reason for this has to be something really bad and very mysterious that is that in the same way a human being a single human being wants to know who he is and wants to become himself or herself wants to live and read his or her proper name one day as it is and at the same time wishes to be safe and therefore accepts and adopts all kinds of disguises and begins to believe all kinds of lies in order to be safe in this safety this mystical or unreal safety he begins to perish this war is in everybody americans want to believe a great many things about themselves which are not true negroes want to believe a great many things about themselves which are not true too part of the dilemma i think of being an american negro is that the negro has been forced for a long long time in many many waysnot only physicallyto mantle himself on a society which always has been essentially incoherent that is to say one is mantling himself on someone who does not know who he is this means then that the imitatorand for the sake of argument you may say that all negroes in this country are imitatorsfinds himself in a very strange confusion and if the writer me jimmy baldwin in this particular case is trying to find out where the truth iswhere i begin and where society stopsto try to tell the truth about my mother or my brother or the porter or the negro bank president and try to find out how this relates to the american myth how it relates to the situation of young people in this countryblack and whitewho are lost in despair and bewildered looking for standards which dont seem to be present in the republic then you have a fantastic kind of confusion and the role of a writer in this country now i think is to begin to excavate almost for the first time the real history of this country not the history that one would like to believe about the founding fathers or the nobility of an abraham lincoln but to try to find out what really happened here what really got us where we are davis i am for better or worst a writer i became an actor not by accident but because i was advised by my professor in philosophy dr alain locke to become a writer when he found that i wanted to write plays and i had come from a little town in georgia called waycross and had never seen a theater he was interested to know how i was going to do it i hadnt given any thought to that part of it so his suggestion was to go become a part of the theater build sets sell tickets learn to act learn everything you can about the theater and eventually you will know what it is you are writing about and for whom you are writing in the terms of actors etc and because of his advice i find myself today from time to time having my long stretches of unemployment interrupted by a job my attitudes toward life have been formed in many places and over long stretches of time and im happy to say that some of the most constructive and generative of those formative people and ideas came from howard university from sterling brown from dr eugene holmes from many others my attitude toward life and toward art and toward writing and toward acting and toward my three children and all the other children in the world is primarily the same i can illustrate it briefly by quoting you a short poem of langston hughes which goes as follows my old mule got a grin on his face he been a mule so long he forgot about his race now im like that old mule black and dont give a damn you got to take me like i am you might think that this is a flippant approach to life and yet its not i have occasion to visit many of the public schools in new york city and in my own community because they are bemused by the idea that im a personage of some importance because i work on the stage and im too modest to disabuse them so when they send for me i go and i regret to inform you at this late date that i have yet to go into a public school in new york city where there was a negro principal i do not mean that the faculties of these schools are themselves vicious people i do not mean that they are themselves antinegro as a matter of fact they send for me and for my wife and for any other performer to prove to the negro child that there is somebody who in spite of his blackness represents a plus factor on the world scene but i submit that the morale of a small child is too delicate and too important an instrument to have this treatment administered adventitiously it has to be done deliberately i think that all public schools should be staffed by teachers of all races of all faiths of all creeds of all persuasions all kind of people so that a child not only sees himself reflected in the echelons of power but he also sees the world as it really is i think that the time has come when we in this country particularly the black man must hang his harp on the willow and refuse to play it unless he can give the truth about himself his people and the society in which we live killens i as a negro writer negro artist negro teacher negro worker ask america to listen to me i am your conscience get right with me and you will truly be beautiful before the world you will be the land you should have been but never have been yet a famous british writer once said many years ago that the important thing about a writer about an artist is out of how deep a life he speaks generally and specifically speaking what is my frame of reference simply stated i am a member of the human race male sex american more specifically i am john killens im a black man who was a black boy once who grew up in a georgia town who lived and cried and hated and fought and sang and laughed at being negro a boy who could not grow into manhood with the fullest implication of the word manhood being a dangerous pursuit in georgia or in mississippi as every freedom rider knows and every sitin student knows one of the problems i am faced with is that publishers want me to write about everything else but the negro publishers and producers from hollywood to madison avenue have said to me why do you always want to write about negroes why dont you just write about people negroes are the only people i know who are set apart because of who they are and at the same time told to forget it no one has demanded that tolstoy or certain other writers be so unspecific in their writings why this pressure on this writer to deny his roots to write about anything else but i think it is because the essence of the negro writers material is critical from the essence of his own being which is a criticism of society but i think that if america is going to get healthy it must listen to this criticism we may be the doctor america needs i write about the negro because this is my frame of reference my lifes experience but i also think that the most dynamic personality the most dramatic image in america today is the negro he is the protagonist personified by james meredith struggling with all his might his brain his great soul and his muscles to bring america out of the backwardness of white supremacy into the epoch of the colored people we live in an epoch where the disinherited for the first time in hundreds of years are in the fore england used to boast that the sun never set on the united kingdom look at the map the way it was years ago and youll see where the sun is setting now this poem by langston hughes sums up why i must write what i write youve taken my blues and gone you sing them on broadway you sing them in the hollywood bowl beautiful light and black our dreams by woodie king jr world is all aglow today and the day itself is beautiful the sun is shining across the street in the park young men and women are laughing and playing in the warm sun now and then pigeons flutter birds glide in and sing gay songs both birds and pigeons are drinking from the beautiful fountains here and there in the warm sun people are reading their free press today she as the sun will return after her long absence he is in the greek restaurant across from the park waiting and dreaming everyone is so full of dreams in the light and in the dark he is remembering her saying and he is thinking of her in light high above the city in a beautiful glass office smiling gleefully he is thinking that on that eleventh floor of that city building how full of dreams she really is aglow he is thinking this today he is sitting again at the same spot again waiting for her again this year he is fifteen minutes early he is remembering but whats your dream he wanted to ask her that last time when she sat across from him finishing her lunch but he did not not that moment but he wanted to he watched her face like poison exotic fruit dark grey eyes large and always on watch lips full and always in that positionthat position that caused him to know his heart could beat queenly the woman everyone wants the beauty parttime actress secretary six hours a day on the eleventh floor of the new city building only one of that beautiful color joanne watching her finish her lunch with a million dreams in that beautiful head beautiful joanne so serene one of the many women born negro yet are almost white inside and outside the kind of negro woman that has a million dreams of winning beauty contests in canada or being the first negro miss street railway then being spotted by stanley kramer or somebody anybody the light kind with the features of the caucasian the kind that all men seem to love because they are yet they are not and yet he is man it is not those things that made him care for her love her for him it goes farther to the time when he first saw her start at the beginning drift backwards travel in slow motion through other winters and summers through time that element that taught her you all the way back to the reason for her being across from you through other tears and laughter the beginning once there was a woman named joanne go on i saw her first on the floor of a little theatre reading her lines from a greek tragedy she and an irish fellow whom she loved oh how she loved him played there on that floor in that little white theatre so gay was her laughter so dry was his talking of their trip to palestine talking of blue grass in the beautiful highlands speaking like modjeska saying gee whiz eating pizza laughing getting excited playing wrestling i would watch her often i had to and i wondered why she never looked at me was it time they read their lines and i being dark and invisible to them chose to remain that way for in a world so white and light so strange i felt darkness was forbidden everything about the theatre was white she blended in i did not i could not often i would pass her sometimes she would look upnot at me but up then it changed we would be apart and our eyes would find each other her smiling ceased no words never never words never smiles strange the irish did not look up he looked down always when he was with her he came with indifference and with indifference did i receive him i dreamed one night that she would tell me i did not belong the dream occurred in a snowstorm far away in a place where the snow never seemed to cease its steady fall and i was lost in that snow desert unable to find my way then i saw her and the falling snow and she was in a sort of transparent nightgown i asked her if she was cold i wanted to protect her from the cold snow wanted her warm her mouth moved i could hear her voice in an echo resounding away away go away away then the dreamed changed i disappeared and a gigantic black man in chains sweat glistening on his back and face walked slowly towards her singing any day now and his presence made the snow melt made the sun shine made her smile and they danced to songs of leadbelly they danced until she became exhausted until belafonte sang until leadbelly cried i reappeared and the snow returned and the echo away away go away away i went away a long interval of dream filled days and nights the middle once there was a store downtown slowly i went in out of the cold white snow a feeling hit me something wonderful more wonderful than life itself in that store something as wonderful as the sudden return of summer after a snowfilled winter my body became fervent i looked for the cause throughout the large store it had to be there it was there i felt it up from the basement all through it until i saw that black and white checked coat far away descending i saw her i looked at her across the store she looked at me no words a smile i found her that winter morning and she saved my summers then we knew we had to know i returned winters and summers of tears and laughter searching the end the end yes life stops sometimes and in those times pain is the only substitute for me there have been many i believe this day will bring another he cares for her and loves her because time caused it time time that puts beginnings middles and endings to life and love still remembering she turned flashing glances through every face within the huge immaculate restaurant then out the large glass window facing circus park the church the institute of technology north and a city filled with pure white snow look at them she said see how they move they dont know where they are going none of them do they he smiled glad to be with her nodded his head agreeing look at that funny looking couple with the poodle he said finally they both laughed i know they are cold i just know it she said why do they pretend they are warm its freezing out there im hip he said but i cant really think of anything outside youre it today love you she said silence while they looked at each other he wanted to ask her have your dreams changed since the last ones he could notnot now they dont even know one of these days they are going to know who we are ay man he nodded and sipped the hot black coffee we are going to be famous man you and i she said but not as serious as it had been said in happier winters and summers and he thought he knew then yes we are going to be famous he said one of these days he looked at her long whats your dream now joanne labold my dream she said i want to get off the eleventh floor of that damned building i want to be somebody want things want so much she turned the spoon in the black coffee sometimes i look from my glass and i want to fly down and kiss my fate but there will have to be revolutions before my dream comes true and i cant wait that long look at me my face where do i belong whats my dream whats your dream am i your dream she looked at him long then out the window north will my dream end here joanne he placed his dark hand on her light face gently gently gently he moved her face opposite his and the black porters in white jackets and black ties gazed the white men in black suits glanced and all the white blonds all white white and starch sat rigid while the knives and forks and spoons tinkled and clashed but he could not hear them he in that moment of black agony heard only the soft white snow falling will my dream end again he repeated himself and the minute she took to answer seemed like an hour we have some time to talk she said he will meet me here in a short while she moved the dark hand away from her face slowly she held it tightly with both hands i wont be seeing you again honest but i love you i love you love you wont be seeing you again he knew then he felt it it was there all the turmoil before an erupting emotion all the rushing to the head of the inside of his soul leaving the boiling deep deep far away in the head then changing to hot tearstears that lingered within his hot burning eyes not coming out to be seen never coming out to be seen tears tears and he fought them he noticed her mouthugly nowmoving trying to say something not hearing her not wanting to he looked out the glass into the white white snow north at the cathedral at the bell that would chime then the te deums that for him would never mean glory after them he would be alone again without joanne again viduity again feeling like a single falling leaf late in the dawn again is this what he had feared her mouth moved i had to see you tell you the seconds of silence seemed like years what can i say hes very nice you will like him anyway you know him hes irish yes i know him he said his voice was a whisper i know she whispered she turned and looked out the glass and that day she remembered she is remembering saturday night sunday morning the end of summer we attended the play long days journey into night how beautiful oneill recreates the feeling of impending doom and i knew there would be a sense of doom in me that night for i had been searching in a strange black world and that world had refused me when i needed it most i wanted to destroy it by becoming a part of the white blending with the white the tragedy of nature he would call it had already told him i loved alexandras that he wanted to take me to paris and ireland and as i remember it was the first time we had ever really talked strange our first conversation had to be about someone white about what that someone wanted to do for me he was hurt because he did not want me to love alexandras did not want me to tell him what white could do for me he tried desperately not to show it i believe i convinced him that that love was a different love not like the feeling for him but i dont think i convinced him anyway he took me to see alexandras in the oneill play he took me to the afterparty he wanted me to be near alexandras it seemed we stayed at the party until four am i glanced at him often watched him moving through the white party dark and invisible to them he never looked at me i talked to alexandras all that time we exhausted ourselves talking about nothing and when we couldnt think of anything else to say we made a date for sunday night i did not tell him he knew we made the date at four am at four am he looked at me across the room through the white crowd sunday morning mourning far away the te deums we talked we kissed for the first time that sunday morning be tween darkness and dawn so gentle gently gently oh god how wonderful i felt i felt more love than dido must have felt and i fell in loves abyss for the first time everything around me was so strange the darkness and the dawn the sun and the night the coldness and the heat all together at the same time all my life i had been told and i felt that i should go beyond darkness and i could i could change with the seasons but everything about me changed when we caught the darkness and the dawn every little thing became a beautiful phallic symbol made me think of him dark and invisible melting the pretty pretty snow i know she said again you shouldnt have told him to meet you here he said we tried you know that tried he tried to say something else no words came even his lips felt heavy thick he prayed to be what she wanted but he knew he could never be lets talk about something else hows your family she looked at him long her eyes and pretty face expressionless everything about her serene as if she was at rest as if she was was inertia i wanted to tell you how it came about i wanted you to understand i understand he said but do you understand dont make me cry she said this had to be do you understand he said louder bitter the black porters in white jackets and black ties turned the blond people all white and starch showed signs of life and he was slowly dying again all my life she said i have had to protect myself be on guard from what he shouted the pimps hustlers lesbians and others trying to misuse me she paused rubbed his hand continued without looking at him i look unusual go on what else he asked more than anything else it is the negro man i am negro man he said and i never attempted to misuse you how could i know that tell me how could i have known how could i be sure you were real i always guess at what you are feeling never knowing where you are never he looked at a white blond snow white crisp are you listening yes the seconds seemed like hours and man i have been misused she lit a cigarette some tell me of movie contracts and i say well miss labold this is it i spend weeks sometimes months making sure disillusioned some tell me they can make me a star in the ebony fashion fairs or put me on the cover or in the center of jet magazine always it seemed like the break my chance some seem truthful and god knows i try i try to find out but its always the same to them i am an illusion they want that day and night dreamme but they dont want the real me they dont want the me that breathes cries wakes up in the morning goes to the bathroom men dont want me they want an illusion joanne he tried to say something please listen please she continued it made me feel like half a woman not complete in the way i want to be complete long ago iarbas i think i discoveredand it may sound funny as hellmen are spiritually weak they believe in god and nature she smiled you too man you too joanne he said you are trying to get outside your world the irish one is not for you he will never be he cannot be nature and god forbid it dont you see dont you understand they could find nothing to say for a long time just as nature and god forbid snow to fall twelve months of the year summer must return you are my summers joanne and if you are leaving because of disillusions feeling i think you are an illusion you will return like summer so full of dreams she said love you in light and darkness i think maybe yes she said the seconds lingered dont leave me joanne he whispered dont take it away i can never be complete with you bridge people i cannot make your dream come true i am human dont you know you will return again dont you know you cannothe cannottake away what is mine by birth you are mine i know it he knows it you know it mine mine mine i love you i love you i love you i love you iarbas i love dont joanne he remembered saying the bell in the church rang onetwothreefour his heart must have skipped a beat he felt his chest once looked out the glass hearing the bell sounding in his ears feeling his heart hitting his chest feeling his mouth becoming dry still looking out the glass looking for that facelooking searching for that face that would blend with the snow and she flashing glances as if really frightened regaining her composure putting on her lipstick or looking at herself in her small mirror and he still looking out into the snow hearing the bell hoping it would cease then both looking out the glass both seeing alexandras approaching from the far end of the park approaching dressed in a black top coat and sitting there he could not hear chains dragging from afar and he could not hear him singing any day now but he could hear music from the psaltery and the music sounded so beautiful in that glen of blue grass in the highlands far away where he could never be but where she might go and leave him forever and she could dance her dance to the music of the psaltery she could play in the bue grass of the high places as she played on that floor in that little theatre long ago she could stop and listen to the bell the bell the bell onetwothree the te deums bongbongbongbongi love youbonglove youbonglovebongyoubong bong alexandros approaching with indifference she rose looked at him see you see you alexandros there she smiling up to him and with indifference did i receive him both leaving he is alone both crossing the snow filled park her checked black and white coats collar turned up he holding her arm going north and she speaking something to alexandros he still sitting in the restaurant watching her ugly back watching the tracks of her black overshoes sink deeper and deeper into the pretty pretty snow watching and hoping hearing her voice see you see you wishing he could be what she wanted he turns and looks into the sun filled park at the couples laughing at the birds and pigeons that lounge and linger there at the beautiful water fountains that emit all colors of waterswaters that spring so misty and settle so clear at the cut green grass so green that it appears blue and the feeling he holds at this moment should be a bequeathal to the world it is everymans he sees her she is running towards him calling his name he stands he smiles she waves and watching her he is thinking that winters cannot last forever but he is also thinking that neither can the warm summers there are so many things that nature and god forbid the flowering of africas seeds by e l lasebikan s a result of the impora v tation of african j slaves into brazil many years ago and their subsequent emancipation and absorption into brazilian society several seeds of the african way of life were sown into the field of brazilian culture of these seeds some sprang up immediately grew into lovely trees and are bearing fruit today especially in bahia where the majority of the population is of african descent to mention three examples only we have first the candomble the religious cult of african origin which commands a formidable following comprising brazilians and foreigners of all races and classes and which in its regalia and decorations has lent scope for a magnificent display of brazilian taste for art and beauty then we have as a direct offshoot of the candomble african religious songs drumrhythms and dancemovements which have been handed down from one generation to another by oral tradition and are kept alive by constant practice at the religious ceremonies espe daily in bahia and thirdly we have food items of african origin such as acaraje vatapa caruru and so on which are relished by many brazilians irrespective of their race of class there is no doubt that many of the seeds sown did perish without ever sprouting into life but it appears that a number of the seeds have remained latent through the years and are waiting to be helped to germinate the move recently made by the university of bahia in inaugurating a course in yoruba language and culture at its centre of afrooriental studies seems to have produced the immediate effect of quickly germinating some of these dormant seeds in addition it holds the promise of being the means by which many more of the dormant seeds will be brought to life and many more fresh seeds introduced among the seeds that have been helped to grow through the inauguration of the course in yoruba language and culture three may be mentioned namely the use of yoruba as a means of communication the wearing of yoruba dress at social functions and the introduction of ayo the formost of yoruba indoor games already most of the second year yoruba students at the centre take pride in greeting each other in yoruba and in holding conversations in the language to the extent of the vocabulary at their disposal a number of the students have also secured pen friends in nigeria and carry on correspondence with them in yoruba though not entirely without occasional assistance and there is no doubt that as the students vocabulary increases and their technique improves they will be able to make more and more use of the language yoruba dress was worn in public by brazilians for the first time on the th of october when the yoruba class staged the play oduduwa ati awon qmo re at the theatre school in the university of bahia on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence of nigeria on that occasion the men turned up in their agbada and fila labankada and the women in their gele and iborun but since then the agbada the gila the gele and the iborun have been worn by bahians several times at social functions on the th of january the sociedade beneficente sao jorge do engenho velho threw a party at casa branca in honour of the fifteen students from different countries of africa who recently arrived in bahia on scholarships awarded by the government of brazil at that social gathering that sunday afternoon the agbada was conspicuously in evidence and it is significant to note that one of the newlyarrived students was wearing a nigeriansewn agbada and the president of the society sr antonio agnelo pereholes in their respective homes with the seeds they have won the player who succeeds in filling up is the winner and he or she wins by the number of seeds left over in the case of both players succeeding in filling up the game is a draw h the winner of one game plays first in the next after a drawn game either of the two opponents may play first i to know the decisive winner it is customary to play a set of three or even seven games the ayo game has only been introduced into the yoruba classes quite recently arrangements for the construction of the first ayo board was placed in the hands of sr antonio jacintho one of the second year students who got a carpenter to make the board from the dimensions supplied and the picture from the cover of alawiye book iii one of the yoruba books prescribed for the course as we are unable to obtain the real ayo seeds in bahia we are improvising with certain beads with a skyblue colour known as contas de louca they are a little smaller than ayo seeds but they are serving the purpose quite well the ayo game is becoming popular among the yoruba students already a number of opon ayo have been ordered by individual students for their homes jacintho later presented me with a copy of the late manoel querinos book entitled a raca africana and called my attention to the bit on page of what the author called aiu and was probably the same as the newly introduced game ayo i discovered that it was the following is what manoel quertino wrote about the game nas horas de descanso entretinhamse a jogar o aiu que consistia num pedaco de tabua com doze partes concavas onde colocavam e retiravam os aius pequenos frutos cor de chumbo originarios da africa e de forte consistencia entretinhamse largo tempo nessa distracao and here is a free translation of it in leisure hours they amuse themselves by playing the aiu which consisted of a block of wood with twelve hollowed parts where they place and remove the aius small fruits of the colour of lead which originated from africa and are of hard structure they amuse themselves for a long time with this pastime later investigation revealed that the ayo game was indeed known in bahia many years ago but that it has now disappeared why a game so popular among the yorubas and by nature so captivating should have died out completely in bahia i still have not been able to find out the ayo game is perhaps one of the seeds of the african way of life which sprang up immediately but later perished without growing to maturity to try and discover why and how it perished might constitute a useful piece of investigation but the more important thing is that a fresh seed of the ayo the foremost of yoruba indoor games has now been sown at the centre of afrooriental studies in the university of bahia brazilian culture appears to me as a culture of cultures constantly being further enriched by the development of the various aspects of the original cultures of the ethnic groups that go to make the brazilian nation the systematic study of african languages and cultures has only just started and is bound to increase and develop as time goes on when therefore in the process of time more of the dormant seeds of the african way of life have been awakened and many more fresh seeds have been sown what an array of lovely trees will be added to the field of brazilian culture what a further enrichment will be made of a culture of cultures is the white southener really inferior by gerald walker ome of my best friends are white southerners and i regret f beyond words the necessity for raising questions which may sorely vex them yet the white southerner problem will never be solved if we continue to gloss over certain hard facts out of a shortsighted desire to spare a minority groups feelings theyas well as we white northernerswill be far better off if at last these troublesome matters are discussed openly personally i feel only the greatest affection and respect for the white southerner in his place the trouble is however that lately the white southerner has shown all too little awareness of what and where his proper place is i refer of course to his precipitous turning away from his traditional agrarian way of life and his rather pushy efforts in recent years to attract new industry below the masondixon line now generally speaking it is certainly commendable for a backward region to try to raise itself but i must add in all candor that the impatient not to say aggressive manner in which a handful of white southerner agitators has gone about this task has sown the seeds of suspicion and competition between our two regions where previously there had been only harmony and understanding indeed interregional relations have deteriorated badly moreover my concern goes far beyond the somewhat narrow consideration that a number of white northerners have already lost their jobs as a result of their factories closing and moving south rather it seems to me that the real point is that perhaps it is time for the rest of the country to ask is the white southerner really ready for progress is he trying to come too far too fast after all the white southerner is but one hundred years removed from practicing slavery and while admittedly he had made rapid strides and come a long way since losing the civil war to an adversary battleproved to be his superior has he yet earned the right of full participation in the industrialized mainstream of contemporary american life would it not be better for all concerned for the white northerner to continue his stewardship of the south until such a time as there was not a shred of a doubt of the white southerners capacity to fend for himself for the plain fact of the matter is that there are vast areas of difference between the white southerner and the white northerner these differencesin morality in criminality in temperament in mentality in ambition and generally in the ability to adapt to the ways of western civilizationfirst became apparent to me when i was a carpetbagging freshman at the university of georgia in at that time though i was still naive and inexperienced enough unquestioningly to accept the prevailing theory that regional differences stemmed from socioeconomic conditions since then as a result of a number of return trips to the south while researching magazine articles i have gotten to know the white southerner well i have lived in close proximity to these people for extended periods visited their homes broken bread with them observed their customs and gone to their social functions making due allowance for the white southerners good qualitieshumor hospitality charm chattinessi soon came to realize that he was in fact a totally different and essentially inferior breed when measured against his neighbor the white northerner more than that it also became obvious that the socioeconomic conditions which i had at first mistaken for determining factors were merely symptoms of some deeprooted congenital flaw in the white southerners fundamental nature these firsthand observations on my part have lately been substantiated by the impartial findings of modern science as set forth most effectively by carleton putnam in his eyeopening work race and reason mr putnam whose extensive background as an airlines executive led him directly into becoming a noted amateur authority in the fields of anthropology biology psychology and anatomy is primarily concerned with demonstrating the innate hereditary factors which account for the observable inferiority of the average negro to the average white some indication of the brilliance with which he succeeded may be gathered from the wide circulationover copies soldand enthusiastic reception that his book has enjoyed in southern states since its publication in for example mississippi governor ross barnett proclaimed october as race and reason day capped by a aplate dinner in putnams honor and the louisiana state legislature passed a resolution that same year ordering high schools throughout the state to assign the book for study to selected mature students needless to say valid scientific principles and procedures are applicable to more than one set of data and circumstances thus a yardstick may be used to measure the length of an eel as well as a snake and so it is only further proof of the ingeniousness and usefulness of the anthropological and cultural criteria developed by mr putnam and his school if i now employ them in a painstaking scientific comparison of the average white southerner and the average white northerner as mr putnam and similarly objective researchers might say let the chips fall where they may it is only the truth that we are after this specialized field is still too new for there to have been much extensive research yet on the comparative skull sizes and brain weights of white southerners as opposed to white northerners however there has been some very good work done in connection with the well known innate defect in the white southerners jawbone and larynx by which he is prevented from speaking the english language properly according to professor w a emerson research director of the nonprofit curtis foundations center for higher learning and himself a white southerner the ws jawbone averages centimeters more in length than that of the typical wn specimen other investigators building upon this discovery have found that this additional length narrows the throat cavity signally constricting the larynx and causing the congenital speech abnormality popularly known as a southern accent in addition particularly in the case of ws females and political figures it seems to produce the peculiar effect of preventing the speaker from cutting off the flow of words until at least the better part of an hour has passed i needless to say no individual ws can be held personally accountable for the current state of his particular set of genes which is the result of several centuries of inbreeding of regional stock that was poor to begin i with but let us lay aside any inference of blame the point is simply that genetic facts are genetic facts and they must be taken into consideration when discussing the ramifications of inherent regional differences along these lines it is of the highest significance that not one of americas first five astronauts was a ws shepard was bom in new hampshire grissom in indiana glenn in ohio camenter in colo rado and schirra in new jersey in short when the national aeronautics and space administration was i given every resource to comb this country for the cream of american manhood the ws was deliberately bypassed in favor of the wn said an air force general at the time project mercury began what were looking for is a group of ordinary supermen nasa either did not look in dixie or if it did none were found but the ws has never been much of a supermannot even an ordinary one as far back as the hon j h lumpkin of georgia referred to our poor degraded halffed halfclothed and ignorant population without sabbath schools or any other kind of instruction mental or moral or without any just appreciation of character frederick law olmstead the distinguished thcentury wn landscape architect traveled throughout the entire old south and in in the cotton kingdom he reported on his interviews with ws men in their own homes and across their own tables the proportion of the free white men olmstead wrote who live as well in any respect as our working classes in the north on an average is small and the citizens of the cotton states as a whole are poor they work little and that little badly they earn little they sell little they buy little and they have littlevery littleof the common comforts and consolations of civilized life their destitution is not material only it is intellectual and it is moral i know not what virtues they have that rude men everywhere have not but those which are commonly attributed to them i am sure that they lack they are not generous or hospitable and to be plain i must say that their talk is not the talk of even courageous men elsewhere they boast and lack selfrestraint yet when not excited are habitually reserved and guarded in expressions of opinion very much like cowardly men elsewhere doubtless the ws will attempt to discount olmsteads careful observations as the biased judgment of a yankee but it is impossible to explain away a strikingly similar description penned by hinton rowan helper a ws born in north carolina in in his book the impending crisis poverty ignorance and superstitionmind you this is helper talking about his fellowwssare the three leading characteristics of the nonslaveholding white of the south many of them grow up to the age of maturity and pass through life without ever owning as much as five dollars at any one time thousands of them die at an advanced age as ignorant of the common alphabet as if it had never been invented all are more or less impressed with a belief in witches ghosts and supernatural signs few are exempt from habits of sensuality and intemperance none have anything like adequate ideas of the duties which they owe either to their god to themselves or to their fellowmen pitiable indeed in the fullest sense of the term is their condition some might object that this is hardly a balanced portrait of ws society or representative ws types what about they might interject the southern aristocrat arent we distorting things by not including him since he embodies the finest flowering of dixies plantation civilization here then is what historian henry adams had to say in his autobiographical the education of henry adams about rooney lee son of robert e lee and the other young southern bourbons whom he knew at harvard from to tall largely built handsome genial noted adams with liberal virginia openness toward all he liked he roony lee had also the virginian habit of command for a year at least was the most popular and prominent man in his class but then seemed slowly to drop into the background the habit of command was not enough and the virginian had little else he was simple beyond analysis so simple that even the simple new england student could not realize him no one knew enough to know how ignorant he was how childlike how helpless as an animal the southerner seemed to have every advantage but even as an animal he steadily lost ground strictly the southerner had no mind he had temperament he was not a scholar he had no intellectual training he could not analyze an idea and he could not even conceive of admitting two so much for the old south what of the newthe industrialized south prematurely announced in by atlanta newspaper editor henry w grady industrialization never fully took but it went far enough for the incisive ws historian w j cash to include a memorable wordpicture in the mind of the south according to cash by the cottonmill worker was a pretty distinct physical type in the south a type in some respects perhaps inferior to even that of the old poor white which in general had been his to begin with a deadwhite skin a sunken chest and stooping shoulders were the earmarks of the breed chinless faces microcephalic foreheads rabbit teeth goggling deadfish eyes rickety limbs and stunted bodies aboundedover and beyond the limit of their prevalence in the countryside the women were characteristically stringyhaired and limp of breast at twenty and shrunken hags at thirty or forty and the incidence of tuberculosis of insanity and epilepsy and above all of pellagra the curious vitamindeficiency disease which is nearly peculiar to the south was increasing this is not the snopeshaunted fiction of a faulkner pursued by a vision of rapacious termitelike subhumans taking over the south these are the words of a ws historian a man who deals in facts not horrific fables the same set of facts underlies erskine caldwells recollection of the countryside in his native georgia around within a few miles from town he remembered families on tenant farms were huddled around fireplaces in drafty hovels most of them were despondent some were hungry as usual others were ill and without medical attention food and clothing were scarce and in some instances nonexistent jobs were rarely to be found i could not become accustomed to the sight of childrens stomachs bloated from hunger and seeing the ill and aged too weak to walk to the fields to search for something to eat thomas wolfe another literary ws has testified to his fellows hostile and murderous intrenchment against all new life their cheap mythology their legend of the charm of their manners the aristocratic culture of their lives the quaint sweetness of their drawl perhaps most disturbing to wolfe was the familiar rationalizing and selfdefense of southern fear and southern failure its inability to meet or to adjust itself to the conditions strifes and ardors of a modem life its old sick appomattoxlike retreat into the shades of folly and delusion of florid legend and defensive casuitry and finally wolfe remarks of his autobiographical character george webber he was a southerner and he knew that there was something wounded in the south he knew that there was something twisted dark and full of pain which southerners have known all their livessomething rooted in their souls beyond all contradiction what is this something wolfe refers to it is that basic flaw of character which made the south the only section of the new young america to indulge on a large scale in the savage practice of slavery the first slaves were brought to virginia in exactly years later alexis de tocqueville sent to the united states by the french government noted how slavery had affected the ws in the intervening time in democracy in america de tocqueville pointed out that to begin with the settlers of the american colonies all belonged to the same european race had the same habits the same civilization the same laws and their shades of difference were extremely slight having begun on an equal footing the scales of character and affluence soon tilted sharply in favor of the nonslaveholding wn to the ws labor is confounded with the idea of slavery while to the wn it is identified with that of prosperity and improvement on the one side it is degraded on the other it is honored thus the men whose task it is to cultivate the rich soil of kentucky are ignorant and apathetic while those who are active and enlightened either do nothing or pass over into ohio where they may work without shame thus slavery prevents the whites not only from becoming opulent but even from desiring to become so this same influence equally extends to their manners in the south there are no families so poor as not to have slaves the citizen of the southern states becomes a sort of domestic dictator from infancy his education tends then to give him the character of a haughty and hasty man irascible violent ardent in his desires impatient of obstacles but easily discouraged if he cannot succeed upon his first attempt wss have neither traditions family feelings nor the force of example to check their excesses the authority of the laws is feeble among them that of morality is still weaker the settlers who are constantly peopling the valley of the mississippi are then in every respect inferior to the americans who inhabit the older parts of the union today three and a half centuries and a dozen generations after the inception of slaverys ill effects upon the ws it is small wonder that the biological law of natural selection should have worked some significant genetic changes the net result being that many of the above ws traits are today hereditary of course it may be objected that what we have just presented are but isolated impressions albeit perceptive ones based on careful observation and investigation what is needed it might be said is largescale objective uptodate evidence concerning the physical and mental makeup of the ws for precisely this sort of data let us now examine some highly revealing selective service statistics from world wars i and ii in army psychologists devised what they called the beta intelligence test to which inductees were subjected a leading segregationist intellectual spokesman richmond news leader editor james jackson kilpatrick cited a sampling of the beta test results in his recent book the southern case for school segregation even the figures selected by him show the ws running a poor second to the wn as can be seen from the following white southerners and white northerners army intelligence tests ws wn state median score state median score mississippi pennsylvania kentucky new york arkansas illinois georgia ohio oddly enough although mr kilpatrick used a similar differential between white southerners and negro southerners as the basis for arguing the latters inferiority and for justifying segregation he did not feel logically impelled to draw the same conclusions about the ws in relation to the wn this is a contemporary example of the wss inability to conceive of admitting two ideas at once first pointed out by henry adams a century ago in the three and a half decades between world wars i and ii the wsthanks to prodigious efforts by the federal government and private foundationsexperienced notable increases in educational cultural economic health and social opportunities surely it might be supposed these gains would have been reflected in some significant improvement in his showing when tested for military service no such improvement can be discerned during world war ii the selective service system divided the country into four regions region i the north region ii the midwest region iii the far west and region iv the south for present purposes let us limit our comparisons to region i consisting of maine new hampshire vermont massachusetts connecticut rhode island maryland delaware pennsylvania new jersey new york and region iv arkansas oklahoma texas florida virginia north carolina south carolina kentucky georgia tennessee alabama mississippi louisiana general service acceptance rates and disqualification rates per white registrants from november to december were region i the north accepted for general service disqualified region iv the south accepted for general service disqualified the difference between the sum of acceptances and rejections and the total of is accounted for by the men admitted for limited service during the above period the acceptance rate of ws males was not only lower than that of wn males of region i but was lower than of wn males in the other two regions as well region ii the midwest accepted disqualified region iii the far west accepted disqualified nor did the relative discrepancy between acceptance and rejection rates for wns and wss change later in the war from january to december the figures were region i the north accepted disqualified region iv the south accepted disqualified illuminating also are the statistics showing the prevalence of certain specific defects per white registrants from november to december region i the north syphilis gonorrhea and other venereal diseases educational and mental deficiency region iv the south syphilis gonorrhea etc educational and mental deficiency infant mortality rates are another index of living conditions and the populations hardiness in a given region expressed as a rate per live white births latest government figures show new england wn middle atlantic wn south atlantic ws east south central ws west south central ws the wss poor showing physically and mentally is matched only by his moral deficiencies and criminal inclinations reported john gunther in inside u s a the kind of piquant sociological detail known to readers of william faulkner still crops up in the news from day to day while i was in atlanta the papers printed a handsome little story about nine sisters all of whom were prostitutes in the same room lillian smith the author of strange fruit told me in clayton georgia of a recent case in which a baby died the parents left it on the bed to rot they were not rendered helpless by grief they made no effort to bury the body because they simply didnt know any better promiscuity and illegitimacy run per cent higher among wss than among wns the u s national vital statistics division reports that for out of every live ws births took place out of wedlock the comparable figure for wns was a mere another way of putting this is to state the white illegitimacy rate as a percentage of total white births a set of figures introduced on the floor of the house of representatives on march by mississippi congressmen john bell williams shows the following ws illegitmate births average per cent of total ws births but only per cent for wns in that same speech ws rep williams let slip another set of figures pointing up the higher rate of crime among wss compared with wns the figures revealed that in the northern states cited by rep williams the rate of wn felony prisoners then in jail came to per wn population but in the southern states he selected the ws rate was per in particular crimes of violence are an old southern custom charlotte n c was once known as the murder capital of america writing in ws historian w j cash said long before hatred for the black man had begun to play any direct part in the pattern of more than three hundred persons said to have been hanged or burned by mobs in the south between and less than ten per cent were negroes the south had become peculiarly the home of lynching cash then goes on to record that of the grand total of negroes lynched in the nation from the beginning of until the close of only were lynched outside the former confederate states and of these were lynched in the border states of maryland kentucky west virginia and missouri themselves more than half southern lynchings aside cash also pointed out that fbi official murder rates showed that the southern cities were over five times as murderous as those of either the north central area or the far west over six times as those of the middle atlantic country and over eighteen times as those of new england true slum negroes did account for many of these southern murders but since the ws was the dominant majority in the south it cannot escape the responsibilty for having set the moral tone of the region of which the overall murder rate is but a reflection such a condition carries over to this day although the ws constitutes per cent of the countrys white population he is responsible for an alarmingly disproportionate share of american crime thus the justic departments latest edition of national prisoner statistics indicates that of all prisoners executed under civil authority in the united states for murder rape armed robbery and kidnaping per cent were wss still another peculiarly southern crime is the deliberate setting of forest fires folksily called firestrolling by wss the region has onefourth of the nations forest acreage but it is annually the scene of over per cent of u s forest fires no less than per cent of southern forest fires during according to an authoritative estimate were the work of deliberate woods burners in louisiana mississippi and florida the percentage ran to per cent and since ws firebugs wait for dry ground and a high wind the cause a total of per cent of our forest acreage loss not only does the ws lawbreaker show disproportionate violence and criminality but there is a similar tendency operating among ws law enforcers this bloodlust is particularly irresistible to ws judges and juries for although the south holds less than onethird of the countrys total population year after year no less than twothirds of american executions take place there illiteracy is still another longstanding ws tradition harry golden in an attempt to escape the crime violence and primitive living standards which pervade their native region over southerners white and negroleft dixie during the s somewhat more than the number of persons who fled east germany during a comparable period unhappily the wsnot to mention his new neighborsfound that he carried these conditions right along with him albert n votaw in the february harpers described the prickly integration problem the ws presented to a typical northern city at that time there were ws recent arrivals in chicago settling together in one south side neighborhood they presented the authorities with a number of difficulties a police captain was quoted as saying they are vicious and knifehappy they are involved in per cent of our arrests in this district observed a municipal court judge youll never improve the neighborhood until you get rid of them other comments on the transplanted ws during the course of the article disorderly untamed to urban ways antisocial to the point of delinquency in the eyes of their neighbors the poor domestic habits they bring from small backwoods communities their housekeeping is easy to the point of disorder children play freely anywhere without any supervision when it comes to sex training their habitswith respect to such matters as incest and statutory rape are clearly at variance with urban legal requirements and parents fail to appreciate the interest authorities take in their sex life on the job they are said to lack ambition considered poor tenants white southern school children are handicapped they are too old for their grades and too mature physically for their classmates prone to disease they are a disgrace to their race a south side school principal has said that the average i q of his pupils most of whom are wss is only moreover only of them had a rating of above the chicago sunday tribune summed things up this way the southern hillbilly migrants who have descended like a plague of locusts in the last few years have the lowest standard of living and moral code if any the biggest capacity for liquor and the most savage tactics when drunk which is most of the time obviously the ws isnt the same kind of person as the wn he just isnt accustomed to or perhaps capable of living the same way the rest of us do and we should make allowances for that fact however at the same time we should put some sensible limit on the extent of the wss participation in business national affairs and interregional social contact after all as harry golden has said would you want your sister to marry a governor faubus the ws may very well represent an insoluble problem in any event it is a problem that will take timea great deal of time perhaps centuriesto even approach solving no one denies the economic disparity between ws and wn but this is only a reflection of genetic facts hereditary equality and total massive integration of the ws into the national economy are things that can neither be rushed nor legislated we must maintain perspective and not plunge headlong into a dubious social experiment for the sake of some vague abstract idea of justice our system may not be perfect but it approaches true justice for all more closely than any other ws and wn should each stick to their own kind moving forward separately and harmoniously as in the past the ws should have enough regional and racial pride to want to develop in his own way and at his own natural pace not force himself in when and where he isnt wanted besides geographical separation is a basic law of nature if the good lord had intended wss and wns to work and live in the same way and locale he would not have created a north and a south in the first place most important of all we cannot risk jeopardizing the american way of life for the sake of the impulsive impatient leaders of a minority that would be a perversion of the true meaning of democracy for although it would undoubtedly raise the ws if the standards of interregional intercourse were relaxed to permit him a larger role in the nations affairs it would at the same time inevitably lower the wn what after all has the ws contributed to american civilization it is an extraordinary catalogue hookworm slavery the filibuster hominy grits the ku klux klan pellagra mint juleps lynching the university of mississippi and high treason in seceding from the union sic transit gloria moonshine of the wss failure to produce a real culture and civilization of his own w j cash said leaving mr jefferson aside the whole south produced not only no original philosopher but no derivative one to set beside emerson and thoreau no novelist but poor simms to measure against the northern galaxy headed by hawthorne and melville and cooper no painter but allston to stand in the company of ryder and a dozen yankees no poet deserving the name save poeonly half a southerner true lately there has been a spurt of interest among residents of the menckendubbed sahara of the bozart in novelwriting but this has never been an activity that could serve as a proper index of the practitioners character industry and moral fiber besides according to gore vidal a wn novelist the ws novelist is not really a writer states vidal southerners talk and talk tell and tell they talk in chronicles they talk in novels emphasis added in other words there is nothing to southern writing but mere gabbiness and the coincidence that some recent flukey change in the structure of a few sets of games has started causing a handful of wss to start putting this gabbiness on paper since there is no artistry involved in idle palaver it is plain that no more cultural credit is due a ws for writing a novel than would be due a monkey typing out gone with the wind by sheer chance it would be patently unfair to leave the impression that all wss are naturally primitive violent criminal shiftless promiscuous uncultured and undistinguished there have been a number perhaps a hundred over the past three and a half centuries who do not fall into those categoriesbut many of these had northern blood among more recent ws notables senator harry flood byrd of virginia and his brother admiral richard byrd have a wn greatgreatgreatgrandmother the father of the late josephus daniels north carolina newspaper editor and statesman was a rhode island ships carpenter zachary taylor twelfth president of the united states had wn ancestry jefferson davis the president of the confederate states was the son of wn and wn blood flowed through the veins of such other stalwarts of the confederacy as major general jeb stuart general james longstreet general john clifford pemberton and john slidell appointed commissioner to france by jefferson davis even daniel boone himself was bom in bucks county pa it should also be duly noted that the figure of the yankee peddler was a familiar one throughout the south during the eighteenth century as he wended his way across the countryside selling his wares it is not inconceivable that in addition to some calicoes scizzors and clocks he may have left behind him some wn genes here and there these might well have made their presence felt without ever showing up on an official genealogy it only needs to be said that the average rankandfile ws today is well satisfied with things as they are but is being goaded on by a handful of agitators and fomentors into making more demands than the country can safely meet or than wss as a whole could handle in their present stage of development who are these clandestine pressure groups and what are they really after a hint was provided in a new york times dispatch of jan about the lures offered by the ws in his drive to attract new industry this steppedup economic warfare wrote atlanta correspondent claude sitton poses a threat to areas in the north and midwest in which rising costs and industrial strife have caused management to grow restless it also has aroused concern in financial circles some securities experts contend that industrial subsidies being offered in both the south and the north are endangering the tax structure and municipal credit and carrying the nation toward state capitalism a south carolina legislative committee has termed these lures somewhat socialistic emphasis added has the kremlin taken over the ws equality movement how sincere is the ws when it can be shown that he is playing directly into the hands of a foreign ideology are we being lulled by a pack of finesounding words into forgetting the wss natural tendencies toward violence and lust these are pressing questions for every wn american to keep in mind during the trying days ahead the new challenge facing negro leaders by eugene walton or the first hundred ii years following the emancipation negro leadership has been absorbed m eradicating the last vestiges of slavery while the battle against jim crow is by no means won it has progressed to a point from which victory can be dimly seen this is certainly no time for negro leaders to let up in any way but a time to press on until this blemish has been completely obliterated from the american scene in achieving this victory they will have not only met and defeated a challenge to their own ingenuity and resourcefulness but eliminated a serious challenge to the whole american ideal as well but with crusades against social diseases as with crusades against physical diseases victory over one challenge only begets a new challenge and the thing that distinguishes successful from unsuccessful social movements is that the leaders of the former are more alert to recognizing new challenges and directing their energies toward meeting them if the ultimate goal of negro leaders is the elimination of all racial prerequisites to the enjoyment of the good life in america then they must surely recognize the differences between the challenge with which they have wrestled for the first hundred years of emancipation and the new challenge they face upon entering the second hundred years the old challenge has been negative in nature fighting against something but the new challenge is a positive one working for something the old challenge has been to knock out mandatory state supported segregation and other barriers that prevent the individual who happens to be darkskinned from competing and benefiting purely on the basis of merit the new challenge is the building of pride self respect and self esteem and confidence of negroes as a group and to devise and create a new and positive relationship for american negroes visavis american society the new challenge is to follow up the victory over racial barriers with a program that will inspire those previously barred to contribute effectively to the political economic and industrial life in america the new challenge is to provide his dispossessed with the intellectual inspirational and spiritual motivation and equipment required for them to fully benefit from the new oportunities that the removal of the barriers will permit under most circumstances the upgrading of a groups position within a larger environment necessitates accompanying changes within the group itself lest the whole effort fail in the case of the changing status of the negro in america these accompanying changes are doubly necessary because of some of the side effects that the long struggle for desegregation has had on the negro community this is to say that some of the arguments and positions advanced for the benefit of improving the negros status relative to his larger environment have caused certain unanticipated consequences in their attitudes toward themselves that tend to make any racial uplift task more difficult than it otherwise would have been what are some of these unanticipated consequences or side effects and how do they make the new challenge to negro leaders more difficult the first of these is that the negro man in the street is confused over goals on one hand and is cherishing unrealistic expectations on the other the questions raised are where are we negroes going and precisely what kind of bargain are we seeking to come out with is it limited to desegregation and free access to the public sector of american life or is it integration assimilation into the private sectors as well then is integration an end in itself or a means to some other end if so what is that end such questions are raised partly because the american mass media and some negro leaders have carelessly and consistently used the terms desegregation and integration interchangeably and failed to distinguish between the two mass circulation newspapers and magazines have been particularly guilty of reporting negroes efforts to desegregate public facilities under the heading of integration and negro leaders have been equally guilty in not correcting them all this has led the negro man in the street to be unsure of where nirvana is but yet to assume unrealistically that it is integration assimilation and that after the current struggle negroes and whites will live happily ever after the unrealism of this expectation was sharply pointed up by tilma cothran atlanta universitys specialist in social theory before the convention of the american sociological association cothran reported that desegregation where it has occurred in the south has been accepted by whites mainly on the basis of conforming to the law and economic pressure and that very few have accepted the rightness of it even if all the barriers to integration were removed this scholar reported there would not be any tremendous association between whites and negroes the implications of the above situation for meeting the new challenge are serious for a people who are expecting to be consumed in the mainstream can hardly be expected to respond favorably to a program of racial uplift they would resist and oppose such an effort on the grounds that it betrayed what we have been fighting for assimilation and stood in the way of their long desired synthesis the more serious of the side effects of the long struggle is that all these years of talk about the importance of racial balance and integration having some whites mixed in to keep it from being allnegro regardless of what it happens to be has caused serious self depreciation and lack of group pride on the part of the negro in the street the clamor for integration has been so strong and stringent as to leave the implication that anything not integrated is ipso facto bad this subconsciously equating integrated with good and negro or allnegro with bad has created the kind of environment in which a young negro couple inspecting a house for sale asks is the school down the street integrated instead of asking is it the best school in town the new challenge of building the spirit and pride of the negro community in america can not possibly be met unless this unverbalized stigma that negroes attach to negro nonintegrated organizations and institutions is eliminated from their minds if the new goals of selfhelp and uplift are met at all it will surely be through the cooperation and coordination of predominantly negro organizations like the churches newspapers fraternal lodges and civic clubs organized at the grass roots level of the negro communities anyone who thinks that with the passing of state supported segregation negro institutions are going to fold up and die while the negro fades namelessly into the mass is just whistling in the dark besides these unanticipated consequences there are other elements in the current sociopolitical situation that will make the new challenge more difficult for negro leaders one is the existence of the organized black muslims as a new fact of life in applying their own solution to the new challenge black supremacy they have poisoned the air for the more legitimate racial uplift movement they have made it difficult for negro leaders to glorify the distinctive contributions of the negro to american life and to urge negroes to take pride in their negroness without running the risk of being branded a black supremacist or separationist another factor that will make the new challenge more difficult for negro leaders is that it calls for such new behavior on their part they have proven their ability to mobilize the negro community against something segregation but can they also mobilize it for something internal group betterment they will learn if they do not already know that it is one thing to get the negro to fight the evils of the white man but something else to get him to fight the evils within himself it is so much easier to lead a wrecking crew than to lead a construction gang unless a lot of old hands learn new tricks or are replaced with young new hands who know the new tricks the new challenge facing negro leadership could turn out to be more than they can handle these then are some of the consequences and factors that will make the job of negro leaders more difficult as they face their new challenge no one should kid himself about the magnitude of the task that lies ahead but in spite of the difficulty and the magnitude this is a challenge negro leaders can hardly afford not to face lest the whole victory of the first hundred years struggle assume a distinctly hollow ring and leave untouched certain conditions which the new challenge would overcome up to now the crime rate neighborhood deterioration illegitimacy and other unfavorable conditions that exist within the negro community have been blamed on the existence of racial segregation and discrimination such claims it should be clearly noted have been well founded since the correlation between social disorganization and socialeconomicpolitical deprivation can be supported by both rational and statistical arguments but with the passing or drastic reduction of segregation and discrimination this rationale will no longer be valid and yet to expect these conditions to right themselves automatically and without a positive program pushes ones confidence in human nature a bit far these are problems that will be with the negro community long after the court cases and sitins have removed the bars of discrimination unless its leaders face up to this reality and act positively to remedy the situation up to this point we have talked glibly about what the new challenge facing negro leadership is like and the difficulties they can expect in meeting it it would be nice if we could conclude by giving them a sure simple guaranteed solution but of course no such thing exists however we could mention two factors bearing on this problem which suggest that the task before negro leaders is far from hopeless first there is the existence of that magnificent body of negro contributions to american culture which we will call negro culture here lies a solid contribution in religious and nonreligious music humor literature and culinary art of which every american negro can be justly proud and which can be used as a kind of news peg for a program to build the spirit and pride of the negro community it provides an alternative to the black supremacy ideology used by the black muslims and can become an excellent positive starting place for a complete reorientation of the negro selfimage the second factor that makes the new challenge facing negro leadership more hopeful than hopeless is that there are already definite signs cthat negro leaders have recognized this challenge and are preparing to meet it most encouraging of these signs was the thematic tone of the national convention of the urban league meeting the conference focused its attention on meeting the changing challenges of tomorrow and was keyed to the problems of unemployment due to automation school dropouts youth incentives migrant adjustment and family disorganization at the conference the executive director dr whitney young indicated that the league has been criticized for being too slow too conservative and failing to produce the results of the congress of racial equality the naacp the southern christian leadership conference and the studentnonviolent coordinating committee it could be we submit that the differences in perception of the effectiveness of these organizations is because the latter ones are reaping the glory of the finale of the original challenge while the league is tooling up to meet the new while the glory of the first century of struggle on behalf of the negro in america certainly belongs to the naacp it may very well be that the new challenge of the second century will belong to the urban league but more likely however it will belong to core naacp sclc urban league and many more organizations yet to be born the challenge is certainly large enough to engross them all the meaning of the i egro experience by dr c eric lincoln ne balmy afternoon in the late summer of a ship of the royal dutch navy put about and tacked slowly into the harbor at jamestown virginia there was something strange about the appearance and the movement of the ship something grotesque and foreboding there was something repulsive and evil about that ship the colonists waiting at the dockside experienced an unaccustomed shudder of apprehension as with an ominous rumble the long anchor chain uncoiled itself and brought the ship up fast against the wharf the captain of the dutch ship caused the plank to be lowered and went ashore followed by as motley a crew of sailors as had ever put to sea their provisions were gone their water was gone they had no moneybut the captain explained that his ship carried a cargo well worth the provisions he wanted the settlers to exchange for it it was a strange cargo it was a cargo of men lying in the darkness in the hold of the dutch manofwar were one hundred separate items of human fleshchained ankle to ankle and wrist to wrist braving the terrible stench and ignoring the cries of the suffering captives by the dim light of a ships lantern the virginians picked out twenty and carried them ashore in chains by that act they founded in democratic america a most peculiar institution an institution about which thomas jefferson himself a slaveholder was to reveal the lacerations of his own conscience when he said i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever this was the first and most compelling image america has had of the negro the image of a commodity a thing to be bought and sold or exchanged a thing to be used in the production of wealth and power comfort and egosatisfaction for the benefit of those who own or have dominion over it with the clairvoyant wisdom which made him a great leader george washington had this to say about negroes as a commodity i shall be happily mistaken if they are not found to be a very troublesome species of property ere many years have passed over our heads george washington has been gathered with the blest for years but that troublesome species of property first landed at jamestown virginia years ago has perhaps proven mr washington unhappily unmistaken for men are not property they are not commodities they may not be bought and sold either on the slave block or at the employment office or in the courts or at the bargaining table or in the real estate office for so long as they are so long will they be troublesome the image of an explorer i have said that the early image most americans have of the negro in america is that of a commodity such was not the negros first role on this continent nor within the present boundaries of this country if no welldefined image consistent with his earlier experiences here has been developed then american history and racial understanding are poorer for the deficiency had you been aboard the good ship pinta on october you would have noticed that among those rejoicing at the sighting of land was a small black man with the air of a scholar he was pedro alonzo nino navigator of the flag ship on which columbus sailed he was a negro if you had marched with balboa to the shores of the pacific in you would have known nuflo de olano one of the thirty negroes included in his expedition or had you served with navarez in you would have thrilled to the heroism of estevanico his negro lieutenant who led an expedition into what is now arizona and new mexico opening up the great southwest for european conquest estevanico died fighting the indians years before the first wagon train rolled westward from the mississippi there were negroes with the spaniards in south america at the conquest of peru with the french in the settlement of the mississippi valley and the founding of chicago and in more recent times even with admiral peary at the discovery of the north pole but the image of the negro as an explorer has not been sustained in the mind of america indeed except for a handful of scholars the negros role in discovery and exploration has remained classified information the image of uncle tom let us look quickly at two other historical images both are stereotypes from the slave period one is that of a gentle old man his hair is white and woolly his back is bent and his shoulders are rounded from a lifetime of genuflection he observes a controlled deference to his betters and a supercilious indifference to the disapproval of his peers he is the medium through which communication passes from one class to another he is the channel of distribution moving from the top to the bottom he is the channel of information moving from the bottom to the top his function is that of control and pacification control of one class for the exploitation of another and the pacification of one class for the protection of another his personal reward is the favor and the protection of the power structure and they call him uncle tom he is rewarded by his peers with suspicion and hatred and envy and fear they rely upon his offices indeed they have no choice and they also call him uncle but never to his face this is an image of the american negro during the slave era it is an image which has persisted into quite recent times but it is an image which has been painfully eroded by the acids of social change the power structure has found the image of uncle tom to be a reliable agent of class control no longer the negro has found the image of uncle tom no longer capable of delivering even the oldtime fractional benefits once surreptitiously lifted from the treasury of american citizenship and further the negro today does not want anything that it takes an uncle tom to procure todays negro doesnt want charity he does want a chance uncle tom is in bad health he will soon be dead the image of a freedom fighter on the second of october in there appeared in the boston gazette the following notice ran away from his master william brown on the th of september last a negro fellow about years of age named crispus feet inches high short curls hair his knees nearer together than common had on a light colourd bearskin coat blue yarn stockings and a checked woolen shirt whoever shall take up said runaway and convey him to his master shall have ten pounds reward history does not record whether the tall knockkneed negro was ever taken up and returned to his master but history has recorded the story of his martyrdom in the cause of american freedom it was the morning of march that the first american patriot died for a cause which remains so dear to us all a cause we have since defended successfully many times but a cause which is forever in jeopardy for the enemies of freedom are not always strangers from abroad so often they lie coiled within the bosom of democracy itself on a cold blustery morning in march years ago a company of british soldiers marched briskly up state street in the heart of downtown boston they had chosen state street because it was the principal street of what was then the principal city in america their objective was to remind the americans of their continued subjection to the british crown and to suppress with force any protestations of injustice or any complaints about secondclass citizenship the americans had become very unhappy over being taxed while being denied representation in the government taxation without representation is galling to any selfrespecting citizenry indeed no people could be reasonably expected to rejoice over a kind of citizenship that required them to share responsibility while privilege was withheld or deferred so it was that when the british soldiers swung arrogantly up the streetresplendent in their scarlet jackets and arrogant and confident in the superiority of their weapons they could not have been surprised to find themselves challenged to be sure the challenge did not come from the class with vested interests for that class was in league with the crown the challenge came from the kind of men for whom principle is more important than wealth or station or even personal security the challenge came from men for whom the vision of equality and justice for all was a presently attainable objective facing the british at the end of state street was a handful of patriots at the head was crispus attucks a man who had established his personal freedom by running away as a youth but who had now as a man returned to play his part in making a more complete freedom available for every americanincluding the master who had put a price on his head as the company of redcoats approached attucks turned to his supporters the way to get rid of these soldiers he said is to attack the main guard with sticks and clubs and whatever weapons that came to hand the americans did attack as crispus attucks led the charge the british soldiers opened fire and he was first to fall three men died with attucks at the boston massacre but the struggle against tyranny had been joined and ultimately the cause of freedom and justice did prevail that america is today a free country testifies most eloquently to the availability of freedom when brave men work together in mutual confidence and determination today we are all free but we are not yet equally free we have been a long time completing the job begun in boston so many years ago crispus attucks provides an image of the american negro as a freedom fighter not many americans remember attucks fewer still not his race his statue still stands on the boston greensward along with those of other heroes of the american revolution for attucks was the first american of any race to give his life in the cause of freedom it is a pity that the editors of our childrens textbooks do not know this or do not think it significant for these times there were many others to follow attucks for the freedom of america did not mean that all americans were free the struggle to be free was continued by negro leaders like nat turner denmark vesey gabriel prosser and others whose names are lost to history contrary to the widely circulated fiction of the negros docile acceptance of slavery there were at least recorded revolts in america between and a period of years in addition there were no fewer than fiftyfive revolts at sea during a similar period since it was the practice to suppress news about slave uprisings less they become infectious it is reasonable to assume that scores of insurrections must have gone unrecorded the historical image of the negro as a freedom fighter is certainly one which must be considered if the current struggle for freedom and dignity is to have perspective we need to talk about the past because the present has no meaning except with reference to the past and to the future america cannot hope to understand the complex image of the contempo rary negro unless there is an historical screen against which to project it we cannot understand the sitins the freedom riders the black muslims the naacp or even the urban league except in the context of antecedent behavior the keys to the negros resentments his forebearance his hostility his love his patience his weariness with waiting his resignation and his determination are all there in his previous condition but the full story of his previous condition is not a mere tale of abject servitude there has not been enough said about the past the negros strengths and his weaknesses are reflected in the images he has of himself and others have of him most negroes have displayed a childish squeamishness about probing negro history they have been too afraid that research might lead to some dark jungle and that the negro would be further disgraced they have been too afraid of being deprived of certain convenient excuses for comfortable mediocrity they seem to enjoy in a segregated society the white man has preferred not to disturb the negros past because he wants no new challenge to his moral consciousness no new feelings of guilt he does not wish to risk the possibility that some outofdate conclusions may on reexamination require some adjustment in his habits of thinking or patterns of behavior it sometimes appears that negroes and whites are joined in a conspiracy of silence for their mutual protection against social and moral embarrassment the threefold myth the racial chauvinists in the south are far from silent in centennial celebrations all over the old confederacy the diehards are resurrecting the pale grey ghost of the civil war they are doing so with the meek compliance of the north and very often with the financial and technical assistance of agencies of the federal government which might well be occupied with more plausible and more socially profitable undertakings the civil war image of the south being offered today to americas innocent and unsuspecting children and to their unprotesting parents is very often fraudulent fictional irrelevant and inane it is an image which carefully ignores the fundamental issues over which the civil war was fought white supremacy is busily engaged in beating a dead horse to make him win a race that is over the resurrection of the grand illusion would be pathetic if ours were a more sophisticated or even a more moral society unfortunately the trinal myth of the negros inherent inferiority his satisfaction with thingsastheyare and the white mans good intentions to be executed of his own initiative byeandbye is still supported by a formidable cult if the negro continues his attacks upon the segregated institutions of the north the cult of the grand illusion is certain to grow larger at least for a time bigotry must have an image of its victim consistent with its aim the negros selfimage the negro has some images of himself whereas outsiders tend to see one negroa composite stereotyped image of the race negroes see themselves as a multifaceted american subgroup with many images some good some indifferent some bad what is the negros image of the negro in america it depends upon which negro you ask it is the dramatic image of thurgood marshall pleading the cause of human justice before the high court of the nation and the conscience of the people it is the image of a shoeshine boy in nashville refusing to scramble for a ioc tip flipped into the gutter at his feet it is the image of martin_luther_king challenging a hatefilled and often violent postchristian society to relearn the great principles of the sermon on the mountshowing them how to win over hatred with love and how to overcome violence with humble faith and selfrestraint it is the image of elijah muhammadblack messenger of a black god calling the disconsolate and arming them with hatred a bitter man this muhammad and one tired of waiting for his share of america leader of the militant black muslims who return hatred for hatred insult for insult blow for blow a black supremacist in search of victory over white supremacy it is the image of jackie robinson maintaining speed while shifting gearsmoving on from a brilliant career in sports to an executive position in a major american business enterprise it is the image of ralph bunche doing a job for his country and losing his racial identity in the process it is the image of ralph boston and wilma rudolph saving the day for america on the olympic fields of the world it is the image of malcolm_x strident apostle of black nationalism preaching in the black ghettos debating at the universities haranguing on the street comers shouting from the television screen and the eleven oclock radio shows think black buy black stay black and beware the white mans phony integration it is the image of louis armstrong the ambassador with a horn at his lips and of chubby checker teaching the world a new twist it is the image of nine little teenagers at little rocks central high schoolignoring the insults accepting the hot soup poured on their heads the lighted cigarettes dropped down their backs the screaming mothers the bombs and the dynamite while the world recoiled in horrorand then cheered and cheered and cheered it is the image of college youth all over americasitting in riding in wading in reading in kneeling inand sometimes having to crawl outgoing to jail accepting their punishment and then sitting in again it is the image of the urban league executives working quietly but persuasively with the concerned and responsible citizens of the great metropolisestrying to make urban living better for all the people irrespective of race or creed the negros image of the negro is sometimes one of a steadily increasing middleclass with all of the status pretentions of the white middle class it is the image of a burgeoning black bourgeosie striving mightily to become totally assimilated into the mainstream of america and suffering massive frustration for having failed there is another imageone of hundreds of thousands of slum dwellers caught in the deteriorated inner circle of the great cities of america the black ghettos ringed with bands of steelpolitical steel economic steel the cold hard steel of prejudice it is the image of crime of drug addiction alcoholism burglary desertion assault prostitution gambling and murder it is the image of unemployment destitution bitterness hopelessness disease and resignation it is the image of extreme poverty in the midst of an affluent society it is the image of a raw deal it is the image of a keg of powder with a six inch fuse the image of a hungry man the most compelling image i know of the contemporary negro is that of a hungry man this is the era of the hungry man to some the abominable hungry man the hungry man is the symbol of very many millions ol people who are hungry for food hungry for understanding hungry for freedom and selfdetermination but most of allhungry for the dignity without which a man is a thing a chattel and a commodity the dignity without which a man is a misfit a monstrous joke in his own eyes a broken vessel in the eyes of god the sign of the hungry man is his determination his dedication his quiet insistence and his courage it is the sign of the search for dignity the negro is like a certain hungry man who though an uninvited guest has seated himself as unobtrusively as possible at the banquet table of america since he was not invited he has come of his own accord since no place was set for him he has brought his own utensils this makes him abominable for no diner of good breeding comes unasked and then brings to the table his own knife and fork but this hungry man has come to eat he feels his right to be there for he has shared in the cultivation of the fields in the production of the food and in the protection of the common heritage that is america from the hostile incursions of our common enemies who would have put us all to the sword the hungry man is seated at the banquet table of america he sees the rich viands passed back and forth in front of him as the opulent diners officially ignore his presence and make merry eating and drinking to satiety i say that the hungry man is officially ignored for behind the convivial facade the light and pleasant chatter the clever exchange of anecdotes there is an uneasy awareness that the hungry man is about to become a problem he refuses to go away he doesnt seem to frighten anymore he is dressed in evening clothes like all the other diners and he sits there like a man who is determined to be served he is quiet and dignified but he has big shoulders he has big hands the problem how to pacify him with the least cost and inconvenience how to get him outor get him served without a commotion that may well spoil the banquet for everybody but the hungry man isnt leaving he has come to eat he has come to stay he has taken his seat at the banquet table he worked so faithfully to help prepare he is sittingin until hes served this is his moment in the struggle for freedom and dignity throughout the world a world in which men have been enslaved by men for so long that the orderly processes of history have been disturbed and the moral nature of man has been grotesquely distorted the negros prevailing selfimage is in general reflected in the determination that if the most desirable values of our society have been consistently preempted on the arbitrary basis of race then the forces which sustain that arrangement ought to be challenged his struggle is nothing more than what america ought to expect of its citizens the selfrespecting contemporary negro is determined that color shall no longer be the criterion by which his opportunities and his personal dignity and worth are to be measuredneither in the south nor in the north nor anywhere else in this democratic society shackles may be made of iron lacerating the flesh and restraining the body but there are shackles of custom and tradition the prejudice which binds the mind kills the spirit and deforms the soul of anyone it touches negroes will no longer submit to bigotry america can no longer expect it of them the essence of the negro almost a hundred years have passed since the fourteenth amendment recognized the image of the negro to be the image of a citizen a hundred years is a very long time for people in an equalitarian democracy to fail to make fully effective the normal expectations of citizenship our national behavior has not been consistent with the very reasonable expectation that the highest values available on equal terms to all instead of working to eliminate causes we have been expending our resources on symptoms instead of policing the forests we have been dissipating our energies running from brush fire to brush firetoo late and with too little water instead of looking for essence we have been looking at images and trying to construct programs on sands that shift with each passing wind an image is a chimera it is always changingalways appearing differently from different perspectives an image is always reflecting the vicissitudes of the times the pressures and opportunities of the moment it is always partly the creation of the man who perceives it image is what you see essence is what you feel in trying to deal with an image one may miss the broader opportunity of encountering a person i have to say that there is no one image of the negro upon which sincere people should attempt to base their social attitudes one can no more generalize about million black americans than one can about million white americans image is what you see essence is what you feel human images differ from day to day from group to group and within the group every group human essence is the same in all menall the time it is that peculiar quality which makes a man a man and separates him from all other possibilities it is essence with which we ought to be concerned for if we were there could be but one image and that would be the image of america notes written at the century mark by murray kempton ghere is a harlem in new york city and there is a harlem in albany georgia that is where the ordinary negro lives out his life there are two lines that william butler yeats set down about another country also productive of special talents but generally inhabited by propertyless country people and their children parnell came down the road he said to a cheering man ireland shall get her freedom and you still break stone a friend of mine talked recently to a negro who had traveled the south looking for work i like to get to a town early the negro said when the garbage trucks are out i look at the back to see whos handling the garbage if its a white man i move on theres no job in that town for me to this have we come one hundred years after the emancipation proclamation how strange that we who are white should think of that date with pride and that the negro should think of it with gratitude every reference to it is a reminder that as recently as our greatgrandfathers time americans held other americans as bond slaves and might well have kept holding them if the south had not gone to war to expand the limits of a system which the north was resigned merely to containing still we boast of this event and the negro is appreciative of it perhaps the stereotypes are accurate and white people are smug and negroes are instinctively polite yet even an instinct may be submerged by the overpowering pressures of circumstances pressures which can produce the muslims a current concern of fashion it is not a fashion i am afraid that has much to do with what they are about because the concern is for their words and not their faces the muslims are most relevant to an unmentioned fact about the negros real situation in the american city most black nationalists are persons of small education in middle age with menial employment the rest of their lives holds no other prospect integration if it came tomorrow would not alter their lives integration cannot make the poor comfortable and the untrained skillful the american economy seems peculiarly designed for the care and feeling of incompetent white men the union fleshpeddler the sheriff of holmes county mississippi the television space salesman the loud man in the saloon all these luxuries of a wasteful society have no real claim upon our contributions to their comfort except that they are citizens and white if they were negroes how many of them would have any expression but black nationalism the negro makes his way to the extent he makes it at all only as creator there are important negro novelists but no fashionable negro critics negroes produce jazz for which the explanatory notes are always written by white critics the parasitic occupations are not for negroes our surplusage sits in offices exercising its imagination only to fabricate expense accounts their surplusage sits on doorsteps in harlem in the daytime there will never be many muslims but i should be surprised if there were not a little muslim in every negro it would be hard to think of an american negro no matter how psychologically integrated who does not enjoy the speeches of malcolm_x a negro who hates us so much that he adopted the initial x to erase his original surname of little which he has to assume belonged originally to the white family that also owned his ancestors but there is no muslim either who is so thoroughly alienated as he says and genuinely feels he is i once served as chairman of a roundtable of negro speakers one of whom was malcolm_x the audience was largely muslim it was a few days after a los angeles muslim temple had been shot up by the local police malcolm_x was in a condition of honest shock and indignation and his audience cheered fervently his message that no white man deserved to be liked or trusted my main function for the occasion was as object to be pointed at in evidence yet as i was leaving three muslims came up to meet me and asked whether i could go to los angeles and find out the truth about what had happened to their brothers they were that ready to trust an enemy they had never seen before that night for there is also a little bit of every negro which understands what camus meant when he said that we are all condemned to live together yet the act of living together can provide release this is a lesson jackie robinson taught perhaps the most conventional of all the things robinson did for america is seldom mentioned robinson could be harsh combative and ungracious after a while he was free to be these things when the fit was on him that right was hardearned for him but he gave us for nothing the priceless boon of being able to dislike him as a human being it was never possible not to respect robinson but it was easy if you were not a dodger fan to be affronted by his belligerence on the field he did not represent a race he competed for a team it was a moment of emancipation for him and for us the first time he was booed not as a negro but as jackie robinson a dodger player robinsons last important hit in baseball was a triple in the world series against the yankees he hit it as a judgment of history over the head of enos slaughter a north carolinian who as a saint louis cardinal had welcomed robinson to the major leagues and the border south by trying to spike him that nigger robinsons hit won the game for the dodgers afterwards a brave sports writer asked slaughter whether he might not have misjudged the ball there aint a left fielder in this game could have caught that ball slaughter answered i never saw even that bastard hit a ball that hard it was jackie robinsons triumph that when he came into the league enos slaughter called him that nigger and when he went out enos slaughter called him that bastard sonny liston may tell us still more than robinsonor even ralph buncheabout the negros progress since emancipation liston is the first morallyinferior negro to be given an equal chance at a position revered by any great number of his fellow americans that is a revolutionary movement for to be a negro in america is to be required to be superior to your station in life liston has an impressive crimimcprh mest mccci nal record but he is not the first thug of this generation to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world by all evidence he is a cleaner fighter inside the ring than tony galento ever thought of being but he is the first negro thug to have that chance before liston a negro heavyweight was expected not merely to fight well enough to win the office but to ennoble it when he got it the most significant opposition to listons advancement did not come from the white citizens councils to whom any negro is as bad as any other unless that other is like floyd patterson a member of the national association for the advancement of colored people it came rather from negroes who thought liston might disgrace their community there were reports that ralph bunche had asked patterson not to risk this disaster there is of course a gap between negroes who have made their way in the white world and those who have been left behind but in this case bunche seemed to reflect a universal sentiment harlem by all accounts was as united against liston as it had been against any challenger for the championship since joe louis fought max schmeling in yet for once at least the negro has judged us whites unfairly sonny liston is not a negro hoodlum to us but simply a hoodlum in his small way he is rendering the special service so many other negroes have given america which is to tell us the truth about ourselves he is the first heavyweight champion to suggest to us the truth about the office he holds it was affecting to have a champion who talked as though he were seeking admission to the university of mississippi but it was also ridiculous pathetic and deceptive sonny liston is a symbol of national maturity there is no longer danger that he will discredit the negro he offers only the bright promise of giving boxing the discredit it has deserved all these years we shall never again i am sure have a member of the presidents cabinet unequipped with a special assistant who is a negro one of his duties a basic necessity of government is to provide protective coloration sonny liston has finally relieved the negro of this function for boxing maturity comes more slowly in other areas of national life but the last five years of all this depressing century have been the best and they began somewhere when no one was looking they might be said for purposes of identification to have begun in clay kentucky where the negro settlement is by decision of the citizens of clay outside of town a nineyearold boy named james gordon was listening to the radio and heard about the national guard being summoned to enforce integration in a school a hundred miles away mommy he asked why cant i go to the white school if his mother answered you got the guts to go i got the guts to take you and he and she went down to the school together and were driven off with shotguns and the national guard came in for them too there were never many of them yet they and the children who follow them have turned and changed that which everyone had thought would be the inevitable development of the south a decade ago the hope of the south was generally considered to be in its upper middle class the south was full of white people who understood that segregation waswhat was that expressionmorally wrong and who reached out their hands to what tiny negro middle class there was but now they are silent it was out of the black poor the most powerless and abandoned of our citizens that people came who had the guts to go the white middle class can no longer talk to the negro middle class but there has come the poor barely literate southern negro child meeting the poor white face to face enforcing a reminder of his human identity and because of these children it will never again be easy for a southern deputy sheriff to think one negro like every other charley jones of charlotte north carolina has been in prison eight times as a core leader the last time was in albany georgia where by then the police were so welltrained and circumspect that some advanced social thinkers complained that there was not enough violence to dramatize the problem and dont you think its nice that theyre not beating us up any longer charley jones answered i guess youve never been in a southern jail how proud a southern negro woman is of a son who goes to jail the negro male is peculiarly a menial in this culture and he is a menial whose degradation is less in demand than it once was the negro woman as domestic is most often the support of the family the image of a negro boy who wills to go to jail to assert himself a man is a sudden delightful surprise i dont think its fair an albany mother said last summer to get a boy out of jail if he dont want to who would have thought that these school children when they began might have done something as important as to make life easier for every poor southern negro who goes to jail a hundred years later they have started where the emancipation proclamation should have started all these things are of course simple and obvious but after a century it remains a particular complication that what is truly obvious is so seldom said a mother reported with pride to me the other m day her daughters comment on the mississippi riots but this little girl had said its all so simple it doesnt make any difference what color anyones skin is but what is simple and obvious is quite the opposite it makes an enormous difference what color a mans skin is the difference is not just in the places a negro is kept out of but in the atmosphere of the places he gets into i have a friend who is a reporter for one of the news magazines his specialties exceptionally nonparochial for a negroare labor and politics he was in chicago one day and stopped in to see adlai stevenson right after his greeting stevenson said wryly that he supposed his visitor had come to talk about civil_rights when he was only a candidate for president john f kennedy met twice with jackie robinson to solicit his support the meetings were cold hostile and left the senator baffled what does robinson want he asked one of those he questioned asked in turn what they had talked about oh civil_rights of course senator kennedy answered only civil_rights of course said the senator white southerners thought for years that negroes werent interested in civil_rights we are more enlightened we think they arent interested in anything else any negros face in a white public place in our world is consequently likely to be the face of the negro that is the problem in some ways he has more privacy in the south because he is taken for granted there how many secret meetings of white citizens council leaders have been held in offices while the omnipresent negro porter went in and out emptying ash trays this is not a fanciful notion i once spent a long afternoon in the office of a citizens council leader in a southern city near the end he turned confidential you know he said theres something i dont understand they know everything we do just as soon as we do i bet theyve got my office wired right now and are taking down everything i say a negro porter was cleaning his waiting room at that moment and could certainly hear everything he said i looked at the porter and constructed a whole network of colored domestics reporting back on masters who like this one were not even aware of their presence i sat there and elected him a conspirator and laughed inside and cheered him on but was that not an invasion of his privacy an assumption one would hardly make about a stranger unless that stranger were a negro it was at best a mixed compliment to refuse to spy can after all be a point of pride so it does make a difference when your face is a label and once a society decides without feeling any need to ask him that a man is nothing except the burning embodiment of a problem with time he comes to seem to us only a crank to government he seems only an inconvenience mississippi would have been quiet if james meredith had not insisted on enrolling in its university offer no victims and there will be no mobs the negro affronts our conscience less than he disturbs our peace and there is a little bit of government in all of us we only are when we see a negro we confront someone who threatens to become to narrow the question almost everyone seems to know by now that white people do not understand the negro but is what everyone knows necessarily the truth we owe to unknown southern negroes whatever has been epic in the history of the united states for the last ten years cooks and maids poor farmers students in colleges that hardly have libraries have become authors of that history cities where no change seemed possible have found themselves at the mercy of little colored children who have gone afraid but proud to prison and emerged laughing sonny liston looks back over what has been as close to an animal existence as could be possible for an american and the only figure outside his world who seems to him worthy of admiration is martin_luther_king and who predicted this wild card in our history except william faulkner we know now that we should have gone to him to find out what the southern negro could do in the same way we wentwe know now to richard wright and ralph ellison and james baldwin not to find out what negroes are but what white people are what is more likely i am afraid is that whatever our color we do not understand ourselves how to spot phony intellectual by horton floyd he definitions a q of an intellectual proj vided by websters jd new international dictionary are the following a person endowed with intellect having the power of understanding having the capacity for the higher forms of knowledge or thought a member of a party or faction claiming to represent or regarded as representing intelligent opinion the above definitions have to do with people who are intellectuals and therefore have the right to be called intellectuals interestingly enough however the people who fit the definitions usually are the people who prefer not to be labelled as intellectuals they take their intelligence and erudition for granted and go about the business of creative labor contributing to art and science and literature and philosophy breastbeating and posturing are characteristics alien to these people they are true intellectuals on the other hand there is a vast and growing breed of poseurs who have all but abrogated to themselves the term intellectual the adjective pseudo which means phony probably best describes them generally but within the group as a whole there are a multitude of variations some of the more familiar specimens of this allembracing breed are described below the philosopher this is the highesttype pseudointellectual for his or her realm of specialized knowledge is in the rarified heights of philosophical profundity with this type it is impossible to engage in a simple uncomplicated discussion all conversa tional avenues lead to quotations from aristotle and plato and every current situation must be considered in the context of great philosophical concepts with this intellectual any sentence or statement is challengeable he delights in differing and will proceed to prove that black is not really black or that the tree standing ten feet away does not really exist names like kant hegel sartre hobbes and descartes and terms like nihilism existentialism theism and empiricism fall from the lips of the philosophical intellectual with the ease of water dripping from a faucet concepts like truth beauty and love which every normal human being is content to accept in their ordinary and usual connotations must be laid out under the microscope of philosophical technique and analyzed and dissected into utter meaninglessness the philosophical intellectual seems happiest when communication is most muddled which may very well be the best indication of the state of his own mentality the psychoanalyst this species is very close to the preceding species they may be said to be unidentical twins while the philosopher is concerned with considering everything in the light of a philosophical discipline the psychoanalyst is intent on forcing everything through the funnel of freudian interpretation the psychoanalyst never accepts anything at face value he must of necessity get to the real meaning behind every word or gesture and this real meaning is never apparent it must always be ferreted out to this unlicensed headshrinker sleeplessness is proof of a guilty conscious friendship for someone of the same sex is latent homosexuality and opposition to domineering parents means an oedipus complex is abroad in the psyche most of the time these amateur analysts have simply had a few college courses in psychology and using their own troubled souls as springboards are intent on proving their superior insight and education the deadliest of the species however are those whose unsolvable problems led them to the professional analysts couch these specimens are like religious zealots they talk and think about nothing but headshrinking and their analysts are the very disciples of the great god freud that these people are sick goes without saying what is significant is the nature of their malady almost without exception they are afflicted with a feeling of inferiority so deep and so basic that not even all of freuds vast army of followers could dig it out and kill it the beard this is a relatively new species of pseudo intellectual in the united states as a whole for many years their habitat in this country was limited by the borders of new yorks greenwich village but they escaped a decade or so ago to places like san francisco and taos and have been generously flourishing all over the landscape ever since speaking generally the beards are a harmless bunch often charming and occasionally even genuine intellectuals may be found among them one such is novelist john a williams a masterful writer and a fine young man who confessed in an article in nugget magazine that he affected his whiskers to disguise an unromantic chin while many of the beardwearing musicians may be classified as intellectuals some like the modern jazz quartets john lewis being the real item all of them are not some musicians wear beards like badges in much the same fashion as phi beta kappas or legionnaires the beards under consideration here are rarely musicians although they sometimes affect a great passion for jazz they are free and independent and rebellious souls or they like to think of themselves in that image but it is dangerous to pursue the question of what they are free from independent of and rebellious against for their answers if they are articulate enough to give answers will usually serve to strip from them every facade of glamour far too frequently it develops that they are free of jobs and the desire to find remunerative work they are independent of responsibility and its concomitant stability and they are in rebellion against maturity of course they will put it differently they will give longwinded speeches about the conformity of american society the degradation of to labor and the utter meaninglessness of the struggle for achievement it is perhaps cruel to say so but far too many of these bearded rebels merely have a greater conception of their own value than they find it possible to express being frustrated by limited talent they take refuge in unlimited posing the excess hair helps to give the distinction they so desperately crave but seem unable to earn the aficionado aficionado is a spanish word meaning roughly a fan it is usually applied to followers of bullfighting those fevered addicts who know and savor every twist of the toreros toe every sweep of the cape every lunge of the bull transported across the atlantic aficionado has come to mean on the one hand an expert and on the other hand a knowitall and since a true expert is a person secure in his knowledge with no need for pretense aficionado does not apply to the expert in this case the concern here is with the aficionado as a knowitallor a phony this species of intellectual is usually found on the periphery of the arts especially jazz he calls all the musicians by their first names just as if he knows them and he uses all the wayout terminology current among jazz musicians bird parker the dead tenor saxophonist is the hallowed and sanctified high priest and miles davis is the holy son there is no other music but jazz and no other musicians but jazzmen and cursed be those who do not worship at the shrine and honor the commandments dope the instrument of death and dishonor among so many jazz musicians holds a very special place in the mystique of the aficionados world it is the open sesame to that surrealistic and levitated mood so endemic to that realm of night while more prevalent on the edges of jazz the aficionado is also found on the outskirts of art sometimes he is a painter an inept one who attempts to compensate for his inadequacy by affecting the airs of a connoisseur he knows what is good painting and what is junk and the incomprehensibles of socalled modern art are all clarities to him whatever the artist was trying to express the aficionado understands it and if it just so happens that the artist in fact was merely expressing his own boredom and lack of imagination then the aficionado comes to the rescue by seeing beyond this aridity to irrepressible talent ah the aficionado is indomitable unconquerable supremely confident in an ignorance without bounds the africanist this is the very latest of the species in the pseudointellectual breed and it is growing with all deliberate speed the most vocal and enthusiastic of this species are those whoa scant decade agowould have come close to puking had it been suggested that they identify with africa and africans now they adore anything african they almost have reached the point where they love anything black but they havent become that extreme yet they talk knowingly of ashanti stools and yoruba culture and the hausa language and can roll off the capitals of the three areas of nigeria with more ease than they can name the states of new england they can hold forth for hours on the glories of ancient mali or the power of the old ghana kings or the beauties of the songhay regime they speak with great erudition of the concept of negritude and could not if their lives depended on it give a coherent statement of the concepts meaning having seized africa and claimed it for their very own they will denounce and challenge anyone who even hints that africans are not all fine and noble and beautiful in short these africaloving pseudointellectuals use africa as a crutch in very much the same way that the aficionados use jazz as a crutch there is a strange militancy about their procedure africa they feel is on the ascendancy and if they can identify with it now then they can ascend with it they will never have to recognize and admit that they havent the stuff to make it on their own there are many other species of the breed of pseudointellectual but the abovementioned ones are the most prevalent true intellectuals have a largeness of outlook and spirit phony intellectuals are narrow and mean they are easy enough to sight they are seldom thoughtful compassionate and willing to listen they are always cocksure and arrogant and all too often wrong floyd patterson revisited by hosea l martin few months ago a friend of mine sent me the july issue of negro digest in his accompanying letter he called my attention to the article are todays athletes too dull by a s doc young im sure my friend sent me the magazine as a joke since i was something of a lackluster athlete in my college days at any rate the article was quickly read and just as quickly forgotten or more truthfully it was filed in that compartment of my mind reserved for articles by frustrated sportswriters who couldnt make their high school football team then came september and the pattersonliston fight ordinarily i have only a passing interest in boxing perhaps because a turbulent boyhood on chicagos south side left me unable to appreciate or understand the spectacle of two grown men beating hell out of each other with mere fists when there were so many really effective weapons at their disposal on th street the cardinal rule had been waste no time with fists and hands when a brick can send em to the promised land violation of this rule could possibly afford the individual his only opportunity to have his name appear in the chicago defenderin the section labeled obituaries my reaction to the pattersonliston skirmish however was a little more than slightly different however passive it might have been i was giving my support to patterson for somehow the mass media had been able to project the image of a young man epitomizing those virtues we find so admirable in public figures skill reticence and a sense of the importance of his position while still maintaining a posture of humility and childlike awe the fact that he was beaten didnt disturb me for defeat has nothing to do with the shattering of an image what truly disturbed me was the unconcealed glee that greeted the news of his defeat was i alone in my admiration of floyd patterson i asked myself and if so what was there about him that blinded others to his qualities that i considered so attractive these were the questions that compelled me to return to that dustcovered issue of negro digest surely i thought mr young would have an explanation for the almost universal rejection of this fallen warrior so i carefully reread that profound article and not being able to believe my eyes read it a third time the fourth reading convinced me that neither advancing age nor the strenuous military life i was leading had impaired my vision to the extent that i would miss a name on a printed page the only conclusion i could draw was that mr young was guilty of a monumental sin of omission in his classification of sports figures he had not classified floyd patterson as neither colorful nor colorless in fact patterson had not been mentioned at all now it doesnt take a mel allen or jimmy powers to realize that the heavyweight boxing championship is in the eyesight of many as significant a position as the presidency of the united states i will always cherish the memory of that seemingly dull student in my high school civics class who couldnt recall where the president resided but volunteered to recite the training sites of louis charles and walcott if one claims that that student should have been admonished then the same punishment should apply to the millions of adults who deemed it their duty to sit glued to their radios until the last punch was thrown in a championship match yet thought nothing of retiring early on the night of a presidential election you will note that i said those devotees sat glued to their radios until the last punch was thrown i make this distinction because many negroes during the era of joe louis felt that the postfight statements by the brown bomber were just too painful to listen to so the wireless was promptly switched off the moment he was called to the mike the few brave ones who did listen to louis classic hi ma i glad i win would invariably squirm with embarrassment and moan why cant he devote a little of his training time to the study of english fewer still were able to recognize and appreciate the pure exhilaration and sincerity conveyed by louis clumsy statement it had an effect on that few that has never been approached by the flowery rhetoric of sugar ray robinson or archie moore but the fact remained that the great hero had flaws glaring flaws that were quickly noted and laughed at by the caucasian public they laughed at his broken english his marital problems and in later years his financial shortsightedness they laughed and soon their laughter began to have its effect on negroes what good is it they began to ask themselves if joe beats billy conn and conn winds up an oil millionaire while joe goes broke paying taxes what satisfaction is there in knowing that our joe is the most skilled ringman in the world if we must look askance at his naive behavior outside the ring their only consolation was the hope that some day the title would be held by a negro who was as wellschooled in the social graces as he was in pugilism i it was a long wait the short reigns of charles and walcott fighters who possessed many of louis flaws but few of his virtueshad to be endured next came the seemingly endless but really short era of marciano an outsider whose retirement was i little lamented by negroes finally the long awaited day arrived on a wintry night of november of floyd patterson descended messianically to fulfill the dreams of negro boxing fans perhaps many will accuse me of sacrilege for comparing the advent of patterson with that of the messiah but who can deny that he was a dream come true his soft polished voice revealed a command of language that was often used devastatingly against snide reporters what a joy he was to listen to on a sports interview show the fact that he didnt make the national bestdressed lists was proof that his taste in clothing leaned toward conservatism and negroes like most americans equate conservatism with dignity add to this the facts that he had a placid almost dull home life had never been photographed in a nightclub andwonders of wonderswas even reported to be saving his money and you have the picture of a sports figure the negro public should have immediately clasped to its breast the fact that it didnt left pattersons admirers bewildered and frustrated they asked the same questions that i asked at the beginning of this article but most of us were unwilling to dig for an answer at the time finally the article by mr young goaded me into launching a factfinding program i hope the answers ive come up with are satisfactory to the ones who failed to discover a similar incentive first it should be pointed out that louis and the negro boxers who preceded him were symbols they were looked upon as symbols of the last negro citadel that had been assaulted but not taken by caucasians the citadel of physical prowess in that era the negro had all but conceded the intellectual war because for each dunbar and hughes he pointed to the caucasian could cite dozens of his own kind that were equal if not better and each time the negro praised his dr drew or dr carver the caucasian would cluck disdainfully and match this claim with a multitude of einsteins comptons and millikans only a foolhardy few however would even dare to claim they ever had a fighter who surpassed joe louis but something happened during world war ii and immediately after it was something that would profoundly affect the status of boxers as well as all sports figures for suddenly the negro had a change of heart about giving up the intellectual war and thus launched an attack that would eventually move the struggle between black and white outside the sports arena and into the world of ideas the physical aspect of the struggle was being supplanted by the intellectual one which was perhaps a little less violent but certainly a great deal more intense in short the seeds that had been sown by the participants of the harlem renaissance began to bear fruit this meant that the negro no longer had to limit himself to one idol there were now so many in so many fields that he could choose fromwith little if any fear that they would be ignored or scoffed at by the caucasian public who was going to scoff at ralph bundles competence as a statesman when the world had bestowed upon him one of its highest honors and would anyone dare expose his lack of good taste by laughing at the writings of james baldwin or ralph ellison after the worlds most celebrated critics had acclaimed them no longer did the negro have to enter a theater with apprehension for instead of the uncle tomish performances he had been subjected to in the past he could now look forward to seeing stars like sidney poitier and sammy davis jr handling roles that were believable even in the sports world the negro found that he had to divide his loyalties among a host of brownskinned starsand all of them werent boxers either should he stay on channel and watch jimmy brown cavort on the pro football field or should he switch to channel and watch wilt chamberlain make shambles of the pro basketball record book should he root for elston howard and the yankees or should he stick with hank aaron and the braves in fact things were going so well for the negro sports fan that in many of them had been tempted to write and accuse the sportswriters of america of prejudice in selecting an all negro all american basketball team after all they reasoned they didnt want their children encouraged to brag about black supremacy it was into this climate of negro achievement that floyd patterson stepped in he had won the championship in hopes of filling a vacuum only to discover too late that it was already crowded it was like the cavalry arriving after the wagon train had been rescued by the infantry despite this however i still feel that the negro owes patterson something i view him as the heir to a position that for a long time was the only thing the negro could reach out and touch and say in this much we are supreme i realize that today the heavyweight boxing championship has been stripped of its importance and has outlived its usefulness as a symbol but is this really any reason for the negro to hold it in less esteem in britain as well as other european countries the monarchy was long ago deprived of its governing functions and yet it is retained for the simple reason that it reminds the people of the glory that once was theirs it is something they consider a part of their heritage and consequently should be preserved and cherished for a nation that is ashamed of its history is ashamed of itself and whether he likes it or not boxing has been an important part of the negros history but all of this will probably fall on deaf ears so i have resigned myself to a comer of each room and barbershop where i will be unable to hear the derisive remarks about floyd patterson my ears are good though and i know that sooner or later one of those remarks will reach them when this happens i know that i will not be able to keep myself from shouting but he was the champion the growing rebellion in the negro church by the rev mr charles h king startling statement was one of the slave codes in the state of mississippi and the year it was written was in today years later the negro minister is still facing the dilemmas of his profession though not a recipient of physical lashes he is increasingly feeling the lashes inflicted by his problems and is beginning to pay the cost the silver bluff baptist church organized in stands today as a monument of the original negro church in america organized by a negro rev j a goflin and located in aiken county south carolina it symbolizes the early desire of the negro to worship in a church of his own negro clergy now serve as spiritual leaders of over million people the baptists compose the largest segment of this number a consequence of the white baptist allowance for negro slaves to enter the ministry other denominations worked among the slaves in the name of christianity but the added incentive of following the negro clergy gave impetus to the denominational attraction towards the baptist with the exception of the above cited slave code of mississippi it is a paradox of history that even as slaves prior to the civil war negroes enjoyed full fellowship in the white churches of the south some due to extraordinary talents and gifts in preaching pastored these mixed fellowships robert e semple in his book the history of the baptist in virginia wrote mr thomas armstead pastored the portsmouth church in virginia until and resigned after his resignation the church declined greatly they then employed josiah bishop a black man of considerable talent to preach for them however soon he resigned because of some objection among the membership william lemmon a man of color was then chosen and served until his death several years later the negro minister currently pastoring over churches of all sizes and denominations today finds himself facing the problem experienced by josiah bishop now the problem is within his own church and among his own people some of these churches are baptist consisting of approximately members the omission here of other denominational problems is not meant to indicate that none exists on the contrary all negro churches in part are confronted with the fundamental dilemmas that are to be presented in this essay the baptist church and its clergy because of size and familiar church structure in negro life invites this appraisal of the dilemmas it presents the negro church is in the throes of a silent rebellion silent it is for no concerted voices are heard in many respects only the clergyman is able to recognize its movement the rebellion is undeniably clear to him for strangely enough it is exerted in his direction a recent seminar held for negro ministers at virginia union university brought to the forefront the basic unrest and insecurity faced by these men many of them from varying denominations related the tensions and internal conflicts that awaited their return the most interesting feature of the seminar was the sessions where problems were shared and solutions offered a stranger happening by chance upon these conversations would have concluded the gathering to be one of dictators planning to curtail insurrection in their respective countries this rebellion probably received its largest thrust in the years following world war ii prior to that time definite patterns were established that are primarily responsible for todays dilemmas to understand the negro church and its clergy an insight into the background of its leadership functions is necessary except in recent years churches required little of their minister in terms of education and training his role as a man of god was highlighted by his ability to arouse his listeners up to the pearly gates of heaven through vocal calisthenics deliberately calculated to provoke emotionalism he was able to hold them there his ability to do this beyond a questionable doubt served a very important need his emphasis was on the hereafter and the gospel that he preached was one of deliverance people suffering from the ills of segregation ill housing lack of opportunity and discrimination welcomed the therapeutic effect that this ministry gave them these ministers and the time that produced them rendered an invaluable service the release given people in the form of religion cast the ministers in the role of a practicing psychiatrist dr morris b tynes pastor of the monumental baptist church chicago in referring to this phenomenon stated if the negro had not been encouraged to shout on sunday he would be compelled by his tensions to shoot on monday this obvious exaggeration only points up the anxieties and frustrations that the ministry of the church succeeded in quelling and succeeded quite admirably such ministry produced the resulting transference towards the symbol of internal healing with little equivocation the negro clergyman held a secure grasp on the hearts of the people his voice was the medicine of hope and eventual deliverance this is not true today great social changes induced by the recent war found the negro making rapid transitions from his life of old employment multiplied managerial techniques and industrial procedures were found in defense factories and in the armed forces in effect the negro was freed from emotional frustrations to an awakening realization that the pearly white gates of heaven were nearer earth than first thought the minister was discovering that he faced each sunday an increasingly enlightened membership following the war the veterans gi bill of rights fha and other equators of progress gave to the negro church solid citizens who had etched a niche in the community of hope the inevitable consequences of this social evolution worked its way into throbbing church discontentment motivated by the antiquity of church dynamics and aggravated by the emotional overtones of the ministry a rebellion brewed within the form of this rebellion has many sides some rebels changed faiths which might account for the increasing negro pilgrimage towards catholicism others remained and developed their rebellion toward the negro clergy itself the rebellion is so quiet that even those who assist it are often unaware of its existence a cross section taken of the average negro congregation is revealing it constitutes a picture of dramatic evolution today the trumpeting voice of the clergy is unheard unless it relates itself to this change if not observed and heeded damaging consequences will be felt the tragic consequence brought about by this rebellion is that both people and clergy deny themselves of the full measure of honest religious experience the minister of the evolutionized church whose voice and philosophy are not cognizant of these changes underestimates the loss of his power churches are known to suffer this ministry only out of respect to his person no assumption is made that they are universally ineffective many in spite of the rebellion are serving remaining needs that shall later be discovered the ministers reluctance to surrender to change is understandable ego is its mainspring it must be remembered that the leadership and power structure of the negro community was formerly and admittedly in the hands of its ministers they spoke acted and listened in behalf of the people the pulpit was the launching pad for community thrust however they now find themselves victimized by the success of their efforts the brighter day that was promised is approaching within this same community are now found lawyers doctors labor leaders teachers collegians and many other competent and enlightened negroes these persons through education and specialization are now adequately serving the increasingly complex needs of the community the beleaguered minister now is haunted by the knowledge that the diminishing emotional characteristics of the church have left him with more sound than substance too late for change he clings to and treasures the few voices that respond to his call for old time religion some churches have become so evolutionized that those who give vent to their feelings through shouting become victims of glares of disgust many suggest that such actions are indicators of mental disturbances lord how far we have come the reasons for this radical change among churchgoers might be found in the progress of the negro himself the negro has achieved many of the rights formerly denied him to be sure he has not yet received full citizenship but his educational opportunities and achievements frequently have surpassed even his own dreams where once he peered hopefully into the swirling waters of democracy he now finds himself in the waters therefore the emotional holds of his religion have been released rightly or wrongly if the negro minister fails to recognize these factors or strives to maintain the multiplicity of tasks that were once his complete domain he strides into the teeth of the rebellion this silent rebellion within the church might be looked upon as the core of the national baptist convention inc conflict the seeds of division were sown in when the struggle for power and position divided it into opposing camps the progressive baptists newly organized in established their break on the claim that established leadership failed to respond to progress thus today baptists are faced with a threeheaded structure each contending for power and prestige these conventional separations offer the negro clergyman a frustrating look at his own congregation unrest dissatisfaction with procedure administrative weaknesses and the clinging vine of emotionalism constitute factors which have risen like yeast from local congregations to split the national bodies ministers who contend most fervently for change at the national level fail to realize they are only echoing the voices of their own congregations the congregations voice unlike his own is silent the blame for this failure of communication must be equally shared local congregations bewildered by the storms that erupt from their ministers at the national level have not recognized that the church itself created the tempest the silent conflict of pew and pulpit has found its catharsis in the conventions as the oldline negro christians make their departure through retirement and death they leave the negro church a mixed legacy it is this legacy that constitutes the dilemma facing todays minister who is fast discerning that he cannot escape his heritage the first problem facing the modern minister is the problem of preaching itself the negro church is a paradox even though the evolutionized church silently rebelled against the emotional service there remains the subconscious desire to experience it the minister who cannot arouse his listeners to occasional bursts of emotional experiences soon finds himself competing unwillingly with those who can these competitors who learned the oldtime art of preaching from their fathers are eagerly sought for revivals and special services the people demand that he make the bible alive exciting and emotional this is the evoluaonized voice crying out for the past whether subconsciously or consciously the desire is there soaring to the heights of rhetorical beauty and using the voice as a painter would splashing a canvas with bright colors the minister surrenders to the past and increases his own dilemma when the local pastor is unable to satisfy these retrogressive moods once again silent rebellion sets in unfortunately many churches do not know what they want from their minister in regards to preaching churches become seriously divided in respect to the character of the minister desired large followings are found on both extremes when a minister accepts a call to a church of this divided nature the groundwork for rebellion is already laid it is noted that the dilemma of how to preach is ofttimes more of a concern to him than what to preach those who apply themselves to the concern of how consequently make a hollow mockery of their own talent the tradition of the pastors anniversary likewise rears up out of the past as one of the seeds of insurrection its original purpose was to honor the pastor by awarding him additional finances to supplement his meager salary money raised by membership taxation were ceremoniously presented to him on this big day as an expression of appreciation seated before the congregation with all of the pomp and circumstances afforded royalty he graciously received their gifts the original purpose was considered both honest and necessary when we consider the internal changes already notedthe diminishing emotional factor and the loss of ministerial influence resulting from the silent rebellionthe existence of the pastors anniversary today places a question mark behind both its honesty and necessity ministers who have an understanding of the psychology of their people have attempted to eliminate this tradition and in its place to obtain wages adjusted to the time in which he lives a recent salary survey taken among all clergymen shockingly revealed how the negro church values its ministry other ministers have discontinued the pastors anniversary because of the hostilities that arise from those who disagree with its purpose finally it has an additional shortcoming in that it subjects the minister to a yearly straw vote as to his popularity probably the most distressing rebellion in the negro church is the one occasioned by the official board of the church baptist churches have two traditional spiritual offices those of pastor and deacon the original calling of the deacons as found in chapter six of acts was to assist the apostles in the care of the membership in order to free the latter for preaching and study even the early church experienced a rebellion among its membership the evolution of society welfare agencies and socialization have now taken from the church many of the tasks and responsibilities of caring for the individual with the exception of sick visitations which are unfailingly required by and of the pastors deacons have been left with little external responsibilities yet as officers of the church and seeking recognition as such they seek and have found administrative authority on par with the minister many churches conscientiously grant them this authority the dilemma posed by this grant is awesome for the minister realizes that authority without responsibility is catastrophic he is faced with allowing such conditions to exist or firming his own authoritative powers neither condition is healthy he finds himself in the position of having to work with these men of varied backgrounds with opinions and personalities to match the variations these men convinced by tradition and urged on by members vie with the minister for administrative leadership if the pastor possesses any degree of human frailty that is obvious to them they have the tendency to magnify it unfortunately in some churches such activity becomes the deacons sole raison detre as can be noted the consequences of this situation render both pastor and deacons ineffective for a full ministry in fact they have a tendency under these conditions to cancel each other out the apostles who initiated the deaconship would be horrified to learn that those who were called to help are actually watering the ground for the seeds of rebellion the minister is helpless to correct this situation without appearing autocratic an appeal to the people for release from this situation is useless after all the growth of the boards authority is the voice of their own rebellion facing the minister also are organizational structures and cliques which individually and collectively seek authoritative recognition and status circles and auxiliaries have created internal pastorates within their own groups and have successfully established a power structure add to this picture the members who deplore such infringements upon the church when the minister is unable or unwilling to challenge the trend of internal competing forces he is soundly blamed for allowing such conditions to exist thus the rebellion is complete facing the necessity of making choices in all these perplexing predicaments the minister recognizes that alternatives are equally conclusive against him however reflection upon his dilemma informs him that the integrity of his office and personality is at stake like paul two men war within him for the possession of his mind casting about in this religious sea the minister discovers the helm slipping from his grasp swirling around him are the angry waves of the rebellion and he realizes the old ship of zion is in peril unwilling to become a martyr to a cause that will not support itself through progress he wrestles with the desire to flee its consequences indeed ministers have been tempted to change professions for the maintenance of peace of mind the internal destructive elements in each crisis evokes additional terror to his very soul yet true to the code of the prophets many ministers hear the voice of god reminding them of responsibility and accountability as with the code of the sea the captain is the last to disembark from a sinking ship his primary responsibility is to the passengers it is here that we find the modern minister his position is not totally unbearable for he recognizes that he himself is a product of the ethnic centrifugal forces that are at work in the church he was born into the structure the ingrained and deeply rooted impulse that brought his religion to life cannot now by the same token be utilized to quiet the rebellion around him here he stands god help him he cannot do otherwise no other profession stands in such urgent need of solutions as that of the negro minister harking back to the code of mississippi in it can be seen that negro ministers are not yet free from its prophetic stricture free negroes or mulattoes for exercising the functions of a minister of the gospel on conviction may be punished by any number of lashes not exceeding on the bare back and shall pay the cost tootsie belle alaska by clinton clark bright summer sun y a lit the scene below as our little plane circled the village of flat alaska this nearly abandoned gold mining town lies midway between the yukon and kuskokwim rivers in an area of small mountains about miles w m southeast of nome gold dredges have thoroughly torn up the countryside making it anything but a place of scenic beauty two dredges still remained one of which was still in operation we set our wheels down on an old landing strip at the edge of town with a mild assortment of uncomplimentary remarks we swatted mosquitoes beyond number as we walked up a pathway through small timber to the village store where we inquired our way to our destination moments later we paused at the door of a small frame building alongside the door time had almost erased the letters which spelled the words tootsies tavern knocking on the door we were greeted by a little old lady who all of alaska knows and loves fighting her way over wilderness rivers and trails mrs martha crosby has forged her name on the pages of alaskan history her career has been a colorful one colorful in more ways than one for tootsie as she is known all over alaska is truly a colored lady black as night tootsie was born in maine in the daughter of joe and susannah mcelhaney next to the baby in a family of her father was a blacksmith after the death of her mother in mr and mrs j d wade who had been friends of the family talked her father into giving tootsie to them to raise i just want a little colored child for an ornament mrs wade said very wealthy the wades spent most of their time traveling he was connected with the united fruit company their travels took them to many of the latin american countries and everywhere they went little tootsie also went but the call of alaska reaches far and eventually they turned their backs on the southern climes attracted by tales of gold and adventure they landed in skagway on september traveling all over alaska and canadas yukon during the years that followed they found the adventure they sought tootsie last saw her foster parents in skagway in they left a large amount of money for her in the bank of commerce in dawson recalling her early life with them tootsie says no white child was ever raised better than i was returning to seattle that same year tootsie married a colored man who worked in a hotel but the next day when he went to work she somehow got the idea that he had run off with her sister and some others and she took out for chicago and never saw him again while on the train she gained the acquaintance of a lady who was en route to take a stage test as a dancer accompanying her new found friend to the rehearsal tootsies feet could not be still and she too started to dance the director said keep going keep going i thought he meant git out tootsie said so i was a gittin out the door and a gittin out fast then he said no no i meant keep dancing whered you learn to dance the director asked tootsie i dont know i guess i was just born that way did you ever hear of the amateur theater no well you go there thus began a year of stage dancing in chicago in accompanied by a colored girl friend tootsie returned to alaska and the two women started stage dancing in iditarod a small village only a few miles from flat but this life was too confining for tootsie so she quit the dancing bought a gasolinepowered boat and went into business hauling freight and passengers between iditarod on the iditarod river and marshall on the yukon river all up and down the rivers she was greeted by eskimos who would run to their friends shouting theres a black white woman in town once she was confronted by an eskimo who exclaimed how come you more blackern us yet you talk like white woman other eskimos rubbed her hands to see if the black would come off staying at a road house she sat at the supper table and was given a very scornful look by an eskimo across the table i don t like you you been here all day and you aint washed your face yet on one trip she took a group of passengers from marshall to kotlik at the mouth of the yukon to catch a steamship but on arrival at kotlik the captain of the steamer refused to accept her passengers he said we will give you all the passengers you want for st michael so she took more passengers and left for st michael despite their warning that they would not pay her if she did not get beyond romanof st michael is on norton sound across from nome just beyond romanof the little river boat got froze in and was marooned there until their food supplies were almost exhausted but patience won out and eventually they arrived at st michael on the return trip to kotlik they were caught in a storm and nearly sank when they left kotlik enroute to st michael one of tootsies crew members was told to bring back a supply of snuff and tobacco but he promptly forgot it on arrival back at kotlik tootsie faced a storm almost as bad as the one on the water one man told her i wish you had drowned weve been out of snuff for two weeks returning to iditarod tootsie opened a road house she cooked for to men alone days and days i never got a chance to go to bed she said handled whiskey too got pinched too in those days gold was the magic word in alaska when you heard of a strike within miles you just took your hat and a crust of bread and started right off across country the mail from outside was brought overland by dogteam road houses were few and far between they slept in the snow didnt carry no tent or nothin tootsie recalled they cooked mush on the trail for their dogs the prettiest thing in the world was to see the mail man a cornin with or dogs with their tails curled up and their little bells a ringin great big dogshuskies them was the kind of dogs to have i wouldnt have these little playthings they have now they cant

life in detail the adventure and drama of her amazing career and she still talks hopefully of future trips over her old trails the flame of adventure still burns in a heart that loves the frozen north the only man on liberty street by william melvin kelley he was squatting in the s v front yard digging f with an old brass spoon in the dirt which was an ocean to the islands of short yellow grass she wore a red and white checkered dress which hung loosely from her shoulders and obscured her legs it was early spring and she was barefoot her toes stuck from under the skirt she could not see the man yet riding down liberty street his shoulders square the duster he wore spread back over the horses rump a carpetbag tied with a leather strap to his saddle horn and knocking against his leg she could not see him until he had dismounted and tied his horse to a small black iron negro jockey and unstrapped the bag she watched now as he opened the wooden gate came into the yard and stood looking down at her his face stern almost gray beneath the brim of his wide ha she knew him her mother called him mister herder and had told jennie that he was jennies father he was one of the men who came riding down liberty street in their fine black suits and starched shirts and large dark ties each of these men had a house to go to into which mostly in the evening he would disappear only women and children lived on liberty street all of them were negroes some of the women were quite dark but most were coffeecolor they were all very beautiful her mother was light she was tall had black eyes and black hair so long she could sit on it the man standing over her was the one who came to her house once or twice a week he was never there in the morning when jennie got up he was tall and thin and blond he had a short beard that looked as coarse as the grass beneath her feet his eyes were blue like jennies he did not speak english very well jennies mother had told her he came from across the sea and jennie often wondered if he went there between visits to their house jennie you ask your mother why i do not stay at night is so she looked up at him yes mister herder the hair under his jaw was not as light as that on his cheeks or on his head he nodded i stay now go and bring your mother she left the spoon in the dirt and ran into the house down the long hall dark now because she had been sitting in the sun she found her mother standing over the stove a great black lid in her left hand a wooden spoon in her right there were jewels of sweat on her forehead she wore a full black skirt and a white blouse her one waistlength braid hung straight between her shoulder blades she turned to jennies running steps mama that man my father he in the yard he brung a carpetbag first her mother smiled then frowned then looked puzzled a carpetbag darling yes mama she followed her mother through the house pausing with her at the hall mirror where the woman ran her hand up the back of her neck to smooth stray black hair then they went onto the porch where the man was now seated surveying the tiny yard and the dark green hedge that enclosed it the carpetbag rested beside his chair her mother stood with her hands beneath her apron staring at the bag mister herder he turned to them i will not go back this time no matter what why should i live in that house when i must come here to know what home is he nodded sharply as if in answer to a question so i stay i give her that house i will send her money but i stay here with you two so her mother stood silently for an instant then turned to the door dinnerll be on the table in a halfhour she opened the screen door the spring whined and cracked oh she let go the door and picked up the carpetbag ill tote this on up she went inside as she passed jennie could see she was smiling again after that jennies mother became a celebrity on liberty street the other women would stop her to ask about the man and he staying for good josie yes you have any trouble yet not yet well child you make him put that there house in your name you dont want to be no sissie markham that white woman come down the same day he died and moved she and her children right into the gutter you get that house put in your name you hear yes how is it it different her mother would look dazed yes it different he told me to call him maynard the other women were always very surprised at first jennie too was surprised the man was always there in the morning and sometimes even woke her up her mother no longer called him mister herder and at odd times though still quite seldom still said no she had never before heard her mother say no to anything the man ever said it was not long before jennie was convinced that he actually was her father she began to call him papa daily now a white woman had been driving by their house jennie did not know who she was or what she wanted but playing in the yard would see the white womans gray buggy turn the corner and come slowly down the block pulled by a speckled horse that trudged in the dry dust a negro driver sat erect in his black uniform a whip in his fist the white woman would peer at the house as if looking for an address or something special she would look at the curtained windows looking for someone and sometimes even at jennie the look was not kind or tender but hard and angry as if she knew something bad about the child then one day the buggy stopped the negro pulling gently on the reins the white woman leaned forward spoke to the driver and handed him a small pink envelop he jumped down opened the gate and without looking at jennie his face dark and shining advanced on the porch up the three steps which knocked hollow beneath his boots opened the screen door and twisted the polished brass bell key in the center of the open winter door her mother came drying her hands the negro reached out the envelop and her mother took it looking beyond him for an instant at the buggy and the white woman who returned her look coldly as the negro turned her mother opened the letter read it moving her lips slightly then jennie could see the wet twinkling at the corners of her eyes her mother stood framed in the black square of the doorway tall fair the black hair swept to hide her tears her eyes glistening jennie turned back to the white woman now and saw her lean further into her seat then suddenly she pulled forward do you understand what i will have them do she was shouting shrilly and spoke like jennies father you tell him he has got one wife you are something different she leaned back again waved her gloved hand and the buggy lurched down the street gained speed and jangled out of sight around the corner jennie was on her feet and pounding up the stairs mama go play jennie go on now play still her mother stared straight ahead as if the buggy and the white woman remained in front of the house she still held the letter as if to read it the corners of her eyes were twinkling and wet then she turned and went into the house the screen door clacked behind her at nights now jennie waited by the gate in the yard for her father to turn the corner walking in the beginning she had been waiting too for the one day he would not turn the corner but each night he came that day seemed less likely to come even so she was always surprised to see him when she saw him she would wave timidly raising her hand only to her shoulder wiggling only her fingers as if to wave too wildly would somehow cause the entire picture of him advancing to collapse as only a slight wind would be enough to disarrange a design of feathers that night too she waved and saw him raise his hand high over his head greeting her she backed away when he reached the gate so he might open it her head thrown way back looking up at him well my jennie what kind of day did you have she only smiled then remembered the white woman a white lady come to visit mama she come in a buggy and give her a letter too she made mama cry his smile fled he clicked his tongue angry now we go see what is wrong come he reached for her hand her mother was in the kitchen she looked as if she did not really care what she was doing or how walking from pump to stove stove to cupboard in a deep trance the pink envelope was on the table she turned to them her eyes were red several strands of hair stuck to her temples she cleared her nose and pointed to the letter she come today her father let go jennies hand picked up the letter and read it when he was finished he took it to the stove and dropped it into the flame there was a puff of smoke before he replaced the lid he shook his head she cannot make me go back josephine her mother fell heavily into a wooden chair beginning to cry again but she white maynard he raised his eyebrows like a priest or a displeased school teacher your skin is whiter my mother was a slave he threw up his hands making fists your mother did not ask to be a slave then he went to her crouched on his haunches befor her speaking quietly no one can make me go back but she can get them to do what she say she turned her gaze on jennie but looked away quickly you wasnt here after the war but i seen things i seen things happen to field niggers that i was up in the house they didnt bother me my own father the general he stood on a platform in the center of town and promised to keep the niggers down i was close by she took his face in her hands maynard maybe you better get on back leastways i go backdead you hear dead these children these cowardly children in their masks will not move me i go back dead that is all we do not discuss it and he was gone jennie heard him thundering down the hall knocking against the table near the stairs pounding up to the second floor her mother was looking at her now her eyes even more red than before her lips trembling her hands active in her lap jennie yes mama she took a step toward her staring into the womans eyes jennie i want you to promise me something and not forget it yes mama she was between her mothers knees felt the womans hands clutching her shoulders jennie youll be right pretty when you get grown did you know that promise me youll go up north promise me if im not here when you get eighteen youll go north and get married you understand jennie was not sure she did she could not picture the north except that she had heard once it was cold and white things fell from the sky she could not picture being eighteen and her mother not being there but she knew her mother wanted her to understand and she lied yes mama repeat what i just said she did her mother kissed her mouth hard the first time ever from the kitchen below their voices came her fathers voice sounded hard cut short jennie knew he had made a decision and was sticking to it her mother was pleading trying to change his mind it was july the fourth the day of the shooting match she dressed in her sunday clothes and coming downstairs heard her mother maynard please dont take her she was frantic now im begging you dont take that child with you today i take her we do not discuss it i take her those sneaking cowards in their masks jennie knew now what they were talking about her father had promised to take her to the shooting match for some reason her mother feared there would be trouble if jennie went downtown she did not know why her mother felt that way except that it might have something to do with the white woman who continued to ride by their house each morning after her father had left for the day perhaps her mother did not want to be alone in the house when the white woman drove by in her gray buggy even though she had not stopped the buggy since the day two months ago when the negro had given her mother the pink envelope but other strange things had happened after that in the beginning she and her mother as always before had gone downtown to the market to shop amid the bright stalls brimming with green and yellow vegetables and brickred meats tended by dark country negroes in gay clothes and large straw hats it would get very quiet when they passed and jennie would see the negroes look away fear in their eyes and knots of white men watching sometimes giggling but the white women in fine clothes were the most frightening sitting on the verandas or passing in carriages some even coming to their windows they would stare angrily as if her mother had done something terrible to each one personally as if all these white women could be the one who drove by each morning her mother would walk through it all her back straight very like her fathers the bun into which she wove her waistlength braid on market days gleaming dark in the beginning they had gone to the suddenly quiet market but now her mother hardly set foot from the house and food was brought to them in a carton by a crippled negro boy who was coming just as jennie and her father left the house that morning balancing the carton on his left arm he removed his ragged hat and smiled morning mister herder good luck at the shooting match sir his left leg was short and he seemed to tilt her father nodded thank you henry i do my best then you a sure thing mister herder he replaced his hat and went on around the house walking her hand in her fathers jennie could see some of the women of liberty street peering out at them through their curtains downtown was not the same flags and banners draped the verandas people wore their best clothes the square had been roped off a platform set up to one side and new marsails avenue which ran into the square had been cleared for two blocks far away down the avenue stood a row of cotton bales onto which had been pinned oilcloth targets from where they stood the bullseyes looked no bigger than red jawbreakers many men slapped her father on the back and furtively looked at her with a kind of clinical interest but mostly they ignored her the celebrity of the day was her father and unlike her mother he was very popular everyone felt sure he would win the match he was the best shot in the state after everyone shot the judge came running down from the targets waving his arms maynard herder six shots and you can cover them all with a good gob of spit he grabbed her fathers elbow and pulled him toward the platform where an old man with white beard wearing a gray uniform trimmed with yellow waited she followed them to the platform steps but was afraid to go any further because now some women had begun to look at her as they had at her mother the old man made a short speech his voice deep but coarse grainysounding and gave her father a silver medal in a blue velvet box her father turned and smiled at her she started up the steps toward him but just then the old man put his hand on her fathers shoulder people had begun to walk away down the streets leading out of the square there was less noise now but she could not hear the first words the old man said to her father her fathers face tightened into the same look she had seen the day the letter came the same as this morning in the kitchen she went halfway up the stairs stopped the old man went on you know im no meddler everybody knows about liberty street i had a woman down there myself before the war i know that the words came out of her fathers face though his lips did not move the old man nodded but maynard what youre doing is different shes your own daughter maybe thats why the old man looked down the street toward the cotton bales and the targets but shes a nigger and now the talk is taking an ugly turn and the folks talking are the ones i cant hold her father spoke in an angry whisper you see what i do to that target you tell those children in their masks i do that to the forehead of any man or woman that comes near her or my house you tell them maynard that wouldnt do any real good after theyd done something to her he stopped looked at jennie and smiled thats my only granddaughter you know his eyes clicked off her youre a man who knows firearms youre a gunsmith i know firearms too pistols and rifles can do lots of things but they dont make very good doctors nobodys asking you to give her up just go back home thats all go back to your wife her father turned away walking fast came down the stairs and grabbed her hand his face was red as blood between the white of his collar and the straw yellow of his hair they slowed after a block paused in a small park with green trees shading several benches and a statue of a sternfaced young man in uniform carrying pack and rifle we will sit she squirmed up onto the bench beside him he was quiet for a long while the warm wind smelled of salt from the gulf the leaves were a dull low tambourine finally he sighed leaned forward to get up but first thrust the blue velvet box into her hand it was cool and almost prickly i give it to you it is yours always remember i give it to you he stood now you must go home tell your mother come later that night jennie tried to stay awake until he came home until he was there to kiss her goodnight his whiskers scratching her cheek but all at once there was sun at her window and the sound of carts and wagons grating outside in the dirt street her mother was quiet while the two of them ate after breakfast jennie went into the yard to wait for the gray buggy to turn the corner but for the first morning in many months the white woman did not jounce by peering at the house searching for someone nr something special by walter monfried erdition catch my p soul but i do love thee fetch me the handkerchief v beware my lord of jealousy it is the greeneyed monster then must you speak of one that loved not wisely but too well the gorgeous rhetoric and fearful tension of shakespeares othello the moor of venice have enthralled three and a half centuries of players and audiences the worlds finest actors have delighted in the challenges of the roles of the bighearted gullible othello and the malicious iago theatergoers find it particularly satisfying when a negro portrays the harassed moor it certainly is the greatest role ever written for an african in the s paul robeson played othello with jose ferrer as iago for several prosperous seasons in the s william marshall headed the brattle troupe of cambridge mass which took othello to new york ira aldridge the eminent th century american actor is often called the first negro to play othello but this is not quite correct when aldridge was a boy in new york james hewlett and several fellow players organized the african company which staged othello and other shakespeare plays there was quite a movement for drama and general education among new york negroes in those days when george washington was president the african free school was established even before a free school for white children was available ira aldridge probably was graduated from that school and from the hewlett company the facts pertaining to his early career are obscure a candidate for an advanced degree in theater history could write a valuable book about him if he or she were willing to undertake long research ira was born about his grandfather was said to have been chief of a senegalese tribe who was assassinated by his subjects for advocating an exchange of prisoners the kings son daniel escaped with the aid of an american missionary and made his way to new york eventually daniel became pastor of a new york congregation and sent his son ira to schenectady n y to prepare for the ministry but the boy had developed a taste for the theater from his school activities and soon returned to new york to take backstage jobs when ira was and working as a stage carpenter he was befriended by a man of influence some historians believe that the friend was the greatest english ac tor of his time edmund kean who was acting in new york around others assert that the benefactor was james wallach a prominent manager of new york and london theaters at any rate aldridge was taken to london and presented in othello when he was only the critics and paying customers received him so favorably that he was starred in the theaters of the capital and of the provinces for many years he was frequently billed as the african roscius roscius was a slave who become the most famous actor of ancient rome and incidentally a millionaire aldridge himself was never a slave and strangely he never acted in the united states as a mature professional he came back to new york a time or two but never could make a satisfactory deal with the managers actually his european successes were more than sufficient he was rapturously received not only as othello but as lear macbeth hamlet shylock and richard iii just about the greatest characters ever created by shakespeare he also starred in plays that are almost forgotten now pizarro the revenge the slave the padlock and others he revived one of shakespeares lesser plays titus adronicus so that he could take the role of aaron the moor his othello remained his best role however and it was unmatched anywhere at that time the journalists reported that the audiences wept shouted and shuddered at his interpretation maria malibran a great singing actress of opera declared never in the whole course of my professional career have i witnessed a more powerful and interesting performance after one performance a leading english playwright sheridan knowles rushed up to him flung his arms about the actor and shouted for the honor of the human race let me embrace you the reception of the american on the european continent was equally ecstatic one of his admirers was the greatest of german opera composers richard wagner who had a prodigious knowledge of theater in general he wrote a friend for your attention wednesday othello with ira aldridge tickets should be secured early in those continental performances aldridge spoke english and the other actors used the language of the particular nation in which they appeared evidently an understanding of his speech was not necessary at a berlin performance the german actress playing desdemona became so alarmed that she screamed and ran from the stage wherever he went aldridge was a box office magnet an announcement of his forthcoming appearance resulted in an advance sale of many thousands of tickets he played for five solid months in berlin and received a week plus expensesan enormous stipend for that era he received decorations and honorary orders from kings dukes and other nobles the king of prussia this before the united german empire was formed awarded him the national gold medal of science and art only three celebrities had received it previously humboldt the naturalist spontini the composer and liszt the pianistcomposer aldridge became a british citizen and made his home in upper norwood his villa there was literally crammed with gifts and decorations a visiting reporter observed a leading french author and critic theophile gautier considered aldridge the finest actor of the midth century he saw aldridge in russia and wrote he was the lion of st petersburg now leningrad it was necessary to engage seats far in advance his entrance as othello was magnificent the frenchman continued with his eyes half closed as if dazzled by the african sun he was othello himself he had that nonchalance that oriental attitude that freedom of movement possessed by a negro which no european can imitate he created an immense effect and received endless applause after his first performance in st petersburg the theatergoers unhitched his horses and pulled his carriage through the streets gautier considered aldridges lear even better than his othello white paint covered his cheeks and a thick white beard enveloped the rest of his face even his fellow players could not have guessed he was a negro although he was at the height of his physical power he did not betray by a single movement that he was a younger man his voice step and gestures were all those of an english king years old many other critics wrote of him with equal enthusiasm a reviewer in the large polish port city of danzig called him the greatest dramatic artist we have ever seen a vienna journalist declared that aldridge is without doubt the greatest actor that has ever been seen in europethis in vienna a traditionally great center of theatrical activity aldridge was twice married his first wife a wealthy english woman had met him when she went backstage tc congratulate him after her death he married a swedish countess amanda pauline brandt three children were born to them their daughter amanda studied singing under the immortal jenny lind the swedish nightingale and became a prominent

off the coast of virginia twenty frightened sick negroes were pulled out of the steaming hold and quickly rowed to shore they were the first african slaves sold in english america the captain mistakenly believed that slaves were his only cargo he had no barrels of rum no agricultural tools no bolts of cloth to put off the negroes carried no baggage they had left all the material manifestations of their culture in africa what the captain didnt know is that a secondary cargo had been secretly stowed away on the shipa cargo that was locked in the minds of all the slaves it was composed of human ideas and traditions one of the stowaways was the african belief that slavery was a natural state of affairs since time immemorial the african negroes had been enslaving each other in fact the new world negroes had been run down and sold to the europeans by some of their own people a few of the newlyarrived slaves had themselves owned slaves in africa therefore it should come as no surprise to know that barely fifty years after the first negroes touched the coast of virginia a few managed to free themselves and become the masters instead of the mastered until now the history of the negros role as slave master has been largely neglected in this country it hasnt been for lack of material evidence the archives of our country contain abundant references to this practiceenough to keep researchers busy for years there are three main reasons why the public has not been made conscious of this little known sidelight on american history first the original writers on the subject said that most of the colored slave masters became such for philanthropic reasonsin order to free or protect their own people it is true that many negro freedmen owned members of their own families such as wives children and parents however in this authors opinion personal emotional motives rather than genuine philanthropy inspired the purchase of close relatives the records prove that few freedmen manumitted slaves outside the immediate family circle there are only a few instances of genuine philanthropy among negro freedmen john barry meachum a negro baptist minister who lived in the early th century purchased negroes and allowed them to earn their freedom on liberal terms in samuel gibson a mississippi negro took his six slaves to cincinnati ohio and settled them on free territory however such philanthropy was rare not enough to release the american negro from his share of guilt the truth is that an uncomfortable percentage of free negroes hungered for property in slaves they bought as many as they could afford and acquired a reputation as hard frugal efficient task masters other historians have wrongly exaggerated the importance of the old laws restricting freedmen on the books they were quite oppressive it appeared that the freedmen could acquire true freedom only by going north in florida their lot was so intolerable that many asked to be returned to slavery however in most slave states the laws against freedmen were intolerable only in theorynot in actual practice they were drawn up to provide legal ground for the whites in case the freedmen got out of hand such laws generally made life impossible for vagrants and the unemployed before the outbreak of the civil war more than fifty per cent of all free negroes lived in the south those who were skilled in the trades or had other special talents had more work than they could handle arkansas and florida appear to be the only states where private enterprise among the negroes was seriously curtailed even so some negroes in those states managed to buy and hold property in their own people others have discounted the importance of negro slaveholding on the grounds that relatively few of them owned slaves in comparison with the whites this is true however the fact that they did it when able and that several of the largest slaveholders in the old south were negroes proves that many american negroes had an appetite for slaveholding and enthusiastically contributed to its perpetuation many negroes used to sit on the spacious porches of their luxurious plantation homes drinking mint juleps and watching their slaves toil endlessly under the blistering southern sun such masters acquired good educations sent their children to the best european schools and went north not to escape but to vacation and purchase items for their plantations in a journey in the seaboard slave states frederick olmstead wrote an intelligent man whom i met at washington who had been travelling most of the time for two years in the planting districts of louisiana having business with planters told me the free negroes of the state in general so far as he had observed were just equal in all respects to the white creoles there were many opulent intelligent and educated the best houses and most tasteful grounds that he had visited in the state belong to a nearly fullblooded negroa very dark man he and his family are well educated and though french is their habitual tongue they speak english with freedom and one of them with much more elegance than most liberally educated whites in the south they had a private tutor in their family as stated at the beginning of this article some negroes freed themselves and acquired slaves just a few decades after their arrival in the new world about the middle of the th century several negroes had become free owners of land there was at least one who owned a negro servant who went to court for his freedom he was turned down because he could not produce the indenture that he claimed to have in his possession one of the first notations in the deed books of st augustine florida is that of joseph sanchez a colored carpenter he sold francisco p sanchez a negro slave for the connecticut historical society has in its files at hartford connecticut a bill of sale from samuel stanton of stonington connecticut dated october to prince a free negro born of a slave woman named binar on the other side is a bill of sale from prince to isaac denison stonington august of the same binar a slave according to the records most free negroes as soon as they acquired sufficient money purchased mates and other close relatives many of the negro husbands who bought wives did not liberate them immediately they preferred to put them on trial for a few years if they proved to be unsatisfactory they were sold proof that not all the free negroes were philanthropic is the wealth of cases where members of the family were sold for profit by their own children or parents c d wilson in an article about negro slaveholders negroes who owned slaves popular science monthly nov tells the story of a free negro named jacob who managed to purchase his father at a reasonable price all went smoothly for a while until one day his father scolded him he was so angered that he sold his father to a negro speculator the trader sent his father south young jacob afterward boasted that the old man had gone to the corn fields about new orleans where they might learn him some manners the negro slaveholders acquired their status by inheritance through white relatives by gifts and by purchase after the manner of their caucasian neighbors some negro tradesmen and businessmen accepted property in slaves as payment for services rendered in antoine robert robin de longy contracted a free mulatto to build the famous mansion destrehan now owned by the panamerican oil co it is one of the oldest houses in louisiana the terms of the contract read as follows robert antoine de longy and charles free mulatto have agreed that the said charles carpenter woodworker and mason by his trade obligates himself to construct a home of sixty feet in length by thirtyfive feet in width for the sums and price mentioned hereafter one brute negro with a cow and her calf fifty quarts of rice in chaff fifty quarts of com in husks and one hundred piastras term applied to the dollar the negro masters owned generally from one to a dozen slaves others ruled the lives of to more than men women and children negro slave owners were to be found in all the colonies or states where slaves were kept in many counties the negro masters were numerous in others they were unknown olmstead in a journey described places in louisiana where white slaveholders were the minority there are also in the vicinity a large number of free colored planters in going down cane river the dalmau called at several of their plantations to take on cotton and the captain told me that in fifteen miles below natchitoches he did not know but one pureblooded white man the plantations appeared no way different from the generality of those of the white creoles and on some of them were large handsome and comfortable houses these free colored people are all descended from the progeny of old french or spanish planters and their negro slaves such a progeny born before louisiana was annexed to the united states and the descendants of it are entitled to freedom wilson in his investigations received the following letter from the hon phanor breazeale of natchitoches louisiana assuming that the records of the parish are a fair criterion by which to judge the other old parishes of the state it was not an uncommon feature of slavery to find that free blacks owned slaves but on the contrary there were prior to the war quite a number of free colored people as they were called who were owners of slaves some of these free colored people in this parish were quite wealthy the records here disclose sales to and from free colored people of slaves i do not recall any instances in examining the records of having found a case where a free black owner voluntarily manumitted his slaves as a matter of interest in studying this phase of slavery i have found by inquiry from old people that free black owners were as a usual thing much more severe on their slaves than the white owners mr d c scarborough of natchitoches wrote wilson the truth of the matter is that free blacks owned bought and sold slaves as did the whites the succession of c n roques in this parish is a case in which a free black owned some hundred or so slaves all of whom were freed by the proclamation of emancipation melrose plantation near natchitoches la was founded by a congolese negress named marie therese coin coin marie was brought to america when she was a small child upon the death of her master she was freed and awarded a large grant of land by the french government the beginnings of her fortune were derived from the forest lands on the plantation after the supply of suitable trees was exhausted she turned to the soil her haitian husband augustin metoyer was a leading slaveholder and philanthropist in the natchitoches community augustin and marie owned more than a hundred slaves and helped the poor people who lived on the banks of the cane river one of augustins gifts to the community was a church on isle breville across the river it is still in use augustins food was served on expensive china he slept on a large four poster bed all of his children had personal servants and his wife managed a large group of maids and houseboys the plantation house melrose manor is now a famous tourist attraction and haven for artists it is in excellent condition and is said to be one of the most beautiful plantation homes in the south it was built by augustins grandson louis metoyer jr in the first half of the th century there were many negro slaveholders in the natchitoches area their descendants live there still many on the same lands that were owned by their slaveowning grandfathers the homes of many natchitoches colored people contain priceless relics and memoirs of their illustrious ancestorsof a day when negroes owned negroes the following extract from the plaquemine louisiana sentinel tells the story of a rich negro who did not know the meaning of philanthropy a wealthy negro family an immense estate in louisiana embracing over four thousand acres of land with two hundred and fifty negroes belonging to the plantation was recently sold for a quarter of a million dollars the purchaser was a free negro who is said to be one of the wealthiest men of the south the above is from a new york paper and refers to the harrison property which was purchased by cyprian ricaud a free man of color of our parish if the property had contained as many acres as stated above and as many slaves it would have brought nearer a million and a quarter than a quarter of a million on the contrary the land we believe comprised some sixteen hundred acres and there were about one hundred slaves of all sizes it lies in the rear of madame ricauds plantation and the two plantations now owned by that family probably do comprise the number of acres of land and slaves as above stated making them doubtless the richest black family in this or any other country the accusation that the black hand of the black master was the crudest was frequently heard throughout the south olmstead in the cotton kingdom wrote a negro with whom the author was talking in that regionin answer to further inquiries said that there were many free negroes all about this region some were very rich he pointed out to me three plantations within twenty miles owned by colored men these bought black folks he said and had servants of their own they were bad masters very hard and cruelhadnt any feeling you might think master dat dey would be good to dar own nation but dey is not i will tell you de truth massa i know ise got to answer and its a fact dey is very bad masters sar id rather be a servant to any man in de world dan to a brack man if i was sold to a brack man id drown myself dough i shouldnt like to do dat nudder but i wouldnt be sold to a colored master for anything this writer does not believe that the bulk of black masters were as cruel as the whites and negroes of that time declared slaves were a valuable investment the free negroes had to make more sacrifices to acquire slaves than the whites did like all property owners they were probably anxious to protect and increase their investments the whites naturally would have been shocked to see a negro punishing another negro as had to be done occasionally as is the case with slavery it was necessary for the masters even black masters to be harsh with their erring servants many prejudiced whites who wanted proof that nigger would out everytime naturally searched for traces of savagery in the freedmen it was probably damaging to a negros vanity to have to be the slave of someone of his own kind prestige factors were probably involved the observation of a northern traveler in texas before the civil war printed in the journal of negro history vol pg intimated the real reason why negroes hated to be owned by members of their own race at another house where we stopped we heard some conversation upon a negro of the neighborhood who had been sold to a free negro and who refused to live with him saying he wouldnt be a servant to a nigger some observers have however written that there were many kind negro slave owners c d wilson wrote mr stevenson archer of mississippi states that he knew a pureblooded negro born free by name nori a corruption of le noir who had before the civil war a large plantation in mississippi and owned about one hundred negroes he was exacting but not cruel and he took excellent care of his slaves such a master was william johnson a rich negro slave owner of natchez mississippithe famous barber of natchez in his diary he writes of a beating he administered to one of his slaves steven got drunk last night and went off and remained all night and was not here this morning to go to market i sent bill nix to the jail to see if he was there and he was not there i then sent him out to dr obdons and in going there he found him and brought him down and left him in the gate and he jumped over the fence and went threw in judge montgomerys yard bill he ran around the corner and found him and brought him in i kept him in the shop a little while and then sent him to the house belonging to bill hazard he ran off times in about three hours and bill nix caught him every time so he brought him home after a while and i went to the stable and gave him a pretty sefveere thrashing with the cow hidethen he was perfectly calm and quite and could then do his work tis singular how much good it does some people to get whiped steven got so bad that johnson was finally forced to sell him south although they never attained the same social status as their white contemporaries most of the successful freedmen were accepted as nearequals william johnson the famous barberbusinessman of natchez was respected by all the whites of that city when he was killed the local newspapers eulogized him the news of his death was talked about as far away as new orleans regardless of the restrictions upon them negro freedmen were usually treated fairly in business and in the courts an example of their right to get the protection of the courts is the following will and testament of a negro freedman from caroline county maryland last will and testament of ricksum webb negro recorded in will record waf no a fol et sq directs that my servant jerry shall serve my son james for the period of ten years after death of testator and then to be free to be given fifty dollars a year during this service and suitable clothing should jerry abscond from service and be taken to be sold for life to the highest bidder in lieu of this service to be sold to a resident of maryland for not less than for a period of ten years and then to be free said jerry to have choice of purchasers servant luke willed to soninlaw eben hughes servant asbury to be free at age of years girl servant ann to be free at age of james turner of queen annes executor will dated may proven th march before william a ford register of wills for caroline county when president lincoln signed his famous emancipation proclamation he reduced many colored freedmen to poverty along with the white slaveholders the negro slaveholders even more than the whites hated to see the end of slavery they knew that once the slaves were free they would be sucked down into the black maelstromand lose all their status the negro slaveowners knew that they could preserve their dignity only while slavery remained an institution in the south abolition was repugnant and unthinkable to them therefore most of the slaveowning freedmen refused to surrender their property in human beings instead they rallied to the cause of the confederacy a group of colored proprietors who owned slaves as a production investment sent a joint communications to the new orleans daily delta dec when secession and war were impending the free colored population native of louisiana own slaves and they are dearly attached to their native land and they are ready to shed their blood for her defence they have no sympathy for abolitionism no love for the north but they have plenty for louisiana in e s dargan forwarded to george w randolph confederate secretary of war the following letter from g huggins cleveland of mobile sir i can raise a battalion of regiment of creoles who are mixed blooded they are mostly property holders owning slaves and a peaceable orderly class and capable of doing good service they are as true to the south as the pure white race after the war was over slavery was snuffed out in the united states the negro masters reluctantly freed their slaves worked their lands themselves or looked negro digest march for other occupationsand sank into tragic obscurity wilson wrote of a colored man named dubroca who lived until near mobile alabama who had been the owner of numerous slaves not long before his death a white acquaintance met him on the streets and asked him how he felt he replied o i am feeling poorly i am getting old they all tell me it was a good thing to free the negroes but i wish i had my niggers back once more wilson also wrote of a negro named james fitzgerald who grieved himself to death over the results of the war by which he lost his slaves the ownership of slaves wasnt the only heights that free negroes attained in the slave states many writers like to impress us with accounts of the negroes progress in the last hundred years or so in this writers opinion the story of negro progress in a slave environment is much more impressive the mystery of how so many thousands of slaves could have thrown off the shackles of bondage rising head and shoulders above both races in a society designed to smother not nurture negro individuality is a phenomenon that defies belief not only did many become rich planters and slaveholders but there were doctors architects businessmen clergymen poets writers artists and skilled tradesmen among them the free negroes of new orleans during the antebellum period attained the highest degree of financial success and the highest level of general culture attained by a similar racial group anywhere in the world the amazing history of the progress of the american negro in the slave states is a super american success story making horatio alger appear weak lifeless and lacking in ambition it is an immortal national epic that preaches a dramatic message not only to the whites and negroes of america but to all the peoples of the world the fact that the spirit of free enterprise and personal achievement cropped up in the negroes in spite of all efforts to keep it suppressed and that previously enslaved men and women rose to dizzy heights proves that the desire for individual achievement is as fundamental as hunger and thirst the freedmen showed the world that there is something indomitable about the mortal yearning and striving for individual achievement their dusky faces staring out at us from the pages of history the old court records and what remains of their plantation homes are testimony to what men can do if they possess sufficient energy and determination while their role as slaveholders was deplorable the energy and sacrifice it took to acquire them are badly needed ingredients in modern society they also proved that a race that can surmount such tremendous obstacles may be a lot of the things people say it isbut inferior it aint before the mayflower by lerone bennett jr came out of a violent storm with a story no one bes v lieved a name no one recorded and a past

sailed into the harbor at jamestown virginia and dropped anchor into the muddy waters of history it was clear to the men who received this dutch man of war that she was no ordinary vessel what seems unusual today is that no one sensed how extraordinary she really was few ships before or since have unloaded a more momentous cargo from whence did this ship come from somewhere on the high seas where she robbed a spanish vessel of a cargo of africans bound for the west indies why did she stop at jamestown the first permanent english settlement in america no one knows for sure the captain ptended john rolfe noted that he was in great need of food he offered to exchange his human cargo for victualle the deal was arranged antony isabella pedro and other africans stepped ashore in august the history of the negro in america began it began in a way with antony and it began with a love story antony who had no surname fell in love with isabella and married her isabella in gave birth to the first negro child born in english america the proud parents named the boy william tucker in honor of a local planter there were other ships other william tuckers other antonys and other

the greatest migration in recorded history the story of antony and isabella is only an act in a larger drama the european slave tradewhich began in and continued for more than years during this period africa lost an estimated lorty million people some twenty million of these men and women came to the new world millions more died in africa during and after their capture or on the ships and plantations these figures though instructive do not say anything meaningful about the people involved the slave trade was not a statistic however astronomical the slave trade was people living lying stealing mur dering and dying the slave trade was a black man who stepped out of his hut for a breath of fresh air and ended up ten months later in georgia with bruises on his back and a brand on his chest the slave trade was a black mother suffocating her newborn baby because she didnt want him to grow up a slave the slave trade was a kind captain forcing his suicideminded passengers to eat by breaking their teeth though as he said he was naturally compassionate the slave trade was a bishop sitting on an ivory chair on a wharf in the congo and extending his fat hand in wholesale baptism of slaves who were rowed beneath him going in chains to the slave ships the slave trade was a greedy king raiding his own villages to get slaves to buy brandy the slave trade was a pious captain holding prayer services twice a day on his slave ship and writing later the famous hymn how sweet the name of jesus sounds the slave trade was deserted villages bleached bones on slave trails and people with no last names the slave trade was caesar negro angelo negro and negro mary above all the slave trade was captain tomba who came to america and nealee who didnt nealee started out but she couldnt or wouldnt make it she was being driven to the west african coast for sale when she became ill and refused to walk another step mungo park who was one of the last persons to see nealee said she was put on an ass but the ass was so very unruly that no sort of treatment could induce him to proceed with his load and as nealee made no exertion to prevent herself from falling she was quickly thrown off and had one of her legs much bruised every attempt to carry her forward being thus found ineffectual the general cry of the coffle slave caravan was kangtegi kangtegi cut her throat cut her throat an operation i did not wish to see performed and therefore marched onwards with the foremost of the coffle i had not walked above a mile when one of karfas the leader domestic slaves came up to me with poor nealees garment upon the end of his bow and exclaimed nealee affeeleetanealee is lost i asked him whether the slatees black slave merchants had given him the garment as a reward for cutting her throat he replied that karfa and the schoolmaster would not consent to that measure but had left her on the road where undoubtedly she soon perished and was probably devoured by wild beasts captain tomba who came to america was first seen in a slave pen in sierra leone john atkins a surgeon who saw him there said he was a handsome man who scorned looking at us refusing to rise or stretch out his limbs as the master commanded a few days later captain tomba and a companion led a revolt on a slave ship and killed three sailors before they were subdued what happened to captain tomba why says john atkins captain harding weighing the stoutness and worth of the two slaves captain tomba and a companion did as in other countries they do by rogues of dignity whip and scarify them only while three others abettors but not actors nor of strength for it he sentenced to cruel deaths making them first eat the heart and liver of one of them killed the woman he hoisted up by the thumbs whipped and slashed her with knives before the other slaves till she died captain tomba living nealee dying john newton praying the king of barsally stealing the fat bishop baptizing captain harding torturing these people and millions like them made the slave trade one of the darkest chapters in the history of man this dark chapter started in the fifteenth century but in truth it goes back to the dawn of history slavery in one form or another has been practiced in every country known to man it was old when moses was young in platos athens and caesars rome menwhite black and brown menwere bought and sold slavery existed in the middle ages in christian europe and in pagan africa in the ancient world almost anyone might become a slave slavery was so prevalent in fact that it was not considered a badge of shame the israelites milton r konvitz reminds us in the promised land did not consider it a badge of shame that their forefathers had been slaves unto pharaoh in egypt on the contrary they were commanded to hold ever in their consciousness not only the fact that they had been led out of their bondage in egypt but also and with equal importance that before the exodus they had been slaves slavery then like alienage could serve as a bond to humanity the experience of slavery in the ancient world was so common that plato ventured to suggest that every man has many slaves among his ancestors ciceros letter to atticus forms a curious comment on the changing fashions in race do not obtain your slaves from britain he wrote because they are so stupid and so utterly incapable of being taught that they are not fit to form part of the household of athens a charming story which revolves around this letter was recounted by the distinguished britisher sir william hamilton fyfe the incident he said happened in sierra leone a lecture had been arranged and the lecturer took the line that the weight and structure of an africans brain was such that it was quite incapable of being developed by higher education he thought his audience was wholly european but when the time for questions came at the end there rose at the back of the hall a tall ebony figure with that wide and winning african smile it was one of the members of the staff of the old and famous missionary college at fourah bay he thanked the lecturer very kindly for his interesting talk and he said you know it reminded me of what i happened to be reading last night in a volume of ciceros letters it was a letter that was written by cicero to his friend atticus the millionaire employer of slave labour and he says in the letter that of all his slaves the british were the ugliest and most stupid and then he added ingratiatingly how you have come on and with that he sat down there was a crucial difference between ancient slavery and modern slavery ancient slavery which had little or nothing to do with race was justified primarily by the rules of war christians and moslems added a new dimension to this ancient institution members of each faith historian kenneth m stampp writes looked upon the other as infidels and hence felt doubly entitled to make slaves of the other when taken as captives moors captured in north africa and in the spanish peninsula were held in bondage in italy spain portugal and france christian prisoners suffered the same fate in the lands of islam christians and moslems alike believed it just to hold heathens in servitude and both found victims among the negroes of africa the moslems got there first for several centuries before the opening of the european trade moslem merchants dragged dark captives across the hot sahara sands then in the fifteenth century portugal diverted this trade to the atlantic the prime mover in this development was a devout covetous prince named henry the navigator excited by stories of the great wealth of africa and asia he ordered his ships to explore the coast of africa there on a fateful day in henrys men came upon the first large group of africans they tiptoed through the high grass and crept to the edge of the village and then said a contemporary they looked towards the settlement and saw that the moors with their women and children were already coming as quickly as they could out of their dwellings because they had caught sight of their enemies but they shouting out st james st george portugal attacked them killing and taking all they could and at last the chronicler continued our lord god who giveth a reward for every good deed willed that for the toil they had undergone in his service they should that day obtain victory over their enemies as well as a guerdon and a payment for all their labour and expense for they took captive of those moors what with men women and children besides those that perished and were killed the pious portuguese captured seventy more africans including a girl they found sleeping in a deserted village and sailed home the captives were promptly baptized and enslaved within ten years portugal was importing one thousand africans a year a century later negroes outnumbered whites in some sections of portugal there was a big demand for negro domestics stevedores and agricultural laborers especially in the southern section by the middle of the sixteenth century says mary wilhelmina williams the inhabitants of the algarve were largely ethiopians and even as far north as lisbon blacks outnumbered whites there was no marked color line and the blood of the two races mingled freely resulting eventually in negroid physical characteristics in the portuguese nation christopher columbus and sugar made the slave trade a big business descendants of the first negro slavesblack christians born in spain and portugalwere among the first settlers of the new world negro explorers servants and slaves accompanied french spanish and portuguese explorers in their expeditions in north and south america they were with pizarro in peru cortes in mexico and menendez in florida thirty negroes were with balboa when he discovered the pacific ocean some authorities believe a negro made the first trip they say pedro alonso nino who piloted one of columbus ships was a negro among the outstanding negro explorers in the new world was estevanico who opened up new mexico and arizona for the spaniards other negroes w e b dubois says accompanied desoto and one of them stayed among the indians in alabama and became the first settler from the old world spaniards who took the lead in the exploration attempted at first to enslave indians but they died out so fast that bishop bartolome las casas a famous missionary recommended in the importation of africans las casas lived to regret this recommendation the development of largescale sugar planting gave the slave trade a cruel twist in a few years droves of negroes were crossing the atlantic each year and the soil of africa america and europe was drenched with their blood strange says eric williams that an article like sugar so sweet and necessary to human existence should have occasioned such crimes and bloodshed an estimated million of these negroes found their way to the land that became the united states of america but the first black immigrants antony isabella and the jamestown groups were not slaves this is a fact of capital importance in the history of the american negro they came these first black men the same way that many perhaps most of the first white men cameunder duress and pressure they found a system indentured servitude which enabled poor white men to come to america and sell their services for a stipulated number of years to planters under this system thousands of whitespaupers neerdowells religious dissenters waifs prisoners and prostitutes were shipped to the colonies and sold to the highest bidder some were sold as the first negroes were sold by the captains of ships some were kidnapped on the streets of london and bristol as the first negroes were kidnapped in the jungles of africa in virginia then as in other colonies the first negro settlers fell into a wellestablished socioeconomic groove which carried with it no implications of racial inferiority that came later but in the interim a period of forty years or more the first negroes accumulated land voted testified in court and mingled with whites on a basis of equality they owned other negro servants and at least one negro imported and paid for a white servant whom he held in servitude negro and white servants kenneth stampp says seemed to be remarkably unconcerned about their visible differences they toiled together in the fields fraternized during leisure hours and in and out of wedlock collaborated in siring a numerous progeny the racial situation at this juncture was fluid it contained the seeds of several alternatives indentured servitude could have continued for negro and white servants or both groups could have been reduced to slavery other possibilities were indian slavery and a free labor system for negroes and whites indians and immigrants socioeconomic forces selected negro slavery out of these alternatives in the west indies sugar was decisive in america tobacco and cotton were the villains a worldwide demand for these products and the rise of plantationsized units to meet this demand focused attention on the labor force how could men be forced to work the rulers of the early american colonies were not overly scrupulous about the color or national origin of their work force indian slavery was tried and abandoned many masters attempted to enslave white men and white women when these attempts failed the spotlight fell on the negro he was tried and he was found not wanting why were negroes more acceptable than poor whites and poor indians white men for one thing were under the protection of strong governments they could appeal to a monarch white men moreover were white they could escape and blend into the crowd indians too could escape they knew the country and their brothers were only a hill or a forest away another element in the failure of indian slavery was the fact that indians tended to sicken and die negroes did not have these disadvantages they were strong one negro the spanish said was worth four indians they were inexpensive the same money that would buy an irish or english indentured servant for ten years would buy an african for life they were visible they could run but they could not blend into the crowd above all they were unprotected and the supply unlike the supply of irishmen and englishmen seemed to be inexhaustible the rulers of early america fell to thinking why not virginia and maryland led the way in the s laws made negroes servants for life intermarriage was forbidden children born of negro women were ruled bond or free according to the status of the mother at first religion was the rationalization negroes were good material for slavery because they were not christians between and the basis shifted to race virginia said it first in her law of the conferring of baptisme doth not alter the condition of the person as to his bondage or freedom after that it was easy a series of laws stripped the negro slave of all rights of personality and made color a badge of servitude the negro population which had grown slowly during the twilight interim of freedom lunged forward by the number had increased to when the declaration of independence was signed there were by the twenty negroes who landed at jamestown in had become where did these people come from how did they come why did they come most of the negro slaves came from an area bordering a mile stretch on the west coast of africa they came chained two by two left leg to right leg from a thousand villages and towns they came from many racial stocks and many tribes from the spirited hausas the gentle mandingos the creative yorubas from the ibos efiks and krus from the proud fantins the warlike ashantis the shrewd dahomeans the binis and sengalese some slaves were captured in native wars and sold to slattees black slave merchants who sold them to europeans some were kidnapped by europeans and africans some were sold into slavery for infractions of native laws driven by slattees some captives made forced marches of miles to the coast where they were examined like cattle and packed into the holds of slave ships they came on these forced marches across rivers and over mountains barefooted and naked to their enemies with chains on their ankles burdens on their heads and fear in their hearts were theythese people who gave to the world the american negro were they the dregs of society no the strong came and the weak too priests princes warriors merchants and nobles came slave traders testified that it was not unusual for an african to sell an african today and to be captured and sold himself tomorrow the story is told of a slave merchant who sold a parcel of slaves and unwisely accepted a social drink to seal the transaction one drink led to anotherand to america the slave merchant woke up the next morning with a hangover and a brand on his chest he was in the hold of a slave ship with his victims and over him stood the captain laughing to beat the band this story underlines a rather obvious fact africans as well as europeans were involved in the slave trade there has been a systematic attempt however to overemphasize the degree of african involvement the picture of a whole continent of africans kidnapping and selling each other for rum guns and gewgaws is wide of the mark it is true that some africans corrupted by europes insatiable desire for human flesh sold their countrymen but many africans like king almammy and captain tomba loathed the whole business and forbade their subjects to take part in it european nations fought each other for the privilege of managing the trade portugal who ran the first leg was ousted by holland who in turn surrendered supremacy on the african coast to france and england portugal one trader said served for setting dogs to spring the game once the game was sprung all europe rushed to the playing field spain barred from africa by a papal bull which gave her most of the new world made her money by giving other powers a contract to supply her colonies with slaves this contract the infamous asiento was the national status symbol of that day it symbolized commercial and political supremacy in the eighteenth century when england held the asiento the slave trade was the basis of european commerce the cause of most of her wars and the prize politicians competed for an intricate set of trading arrangements existed on the guinea coast the west coast of africa for processing africans bought and stolen europeansfrench swedish danish portuguese dutch english and prussian tradersdotted the coast with a series of forts and factories each fort and factory had a dungeon or negroe house where slaves were confined until shipment into these factories europeans poured a steady stream of goods colorful cloth trinkets rum and other strong water blankets old sheetswhich were converted into human beings europeans operating as representatives of powerful companies or as private traders bartered these goods for men and women a woman might change hands for a gallon of brandy and six beads a man might bring eight guns a wicker bottle two cases of whiskey and twentyeight old sheets slaves were purchased from brokers at the forts and factories or in open markets john barbot a famous trader has described an open market on the slave coast as the slaves come down to fida from the inland country they are put into a booth or prison built for that purpose near the beach all of them together and when the europeans are to receive them they are brought out into a large plain where the surgeons examine every part of every one of them to the smallest member men and women being all stark naked such as are allowed good and sound are set on one side and the others by themselves which slaves so rejected are there called mackrons being above thirtyfive years of age or defective in their limbs eyes or teeth or grown grey or that have the venereal disease or any other imperfection these being so set aside each of the others which have passed as good is marked on the breast with a redhot iron imprinting the mark of the french english or dutch companies in this particular care is taken that the women as tenderest be not burnt too hard the newlypurchased slaves properly branded and chained were rowed out to the slave ships for the dreaded middle passage across the atlantic they were packed like books on shelves into holds which in some instances were no higher than eighteen inches they had not so much room one captain said as a man in his coffin either in length or breadth it was impossible for them to turn or shift with any degree of ease here for the six to ten weeks of the voyage the slaves lived like animals under the best of conditions the trip was intolerable when epidemics of dysentery or small pox swept the ships the trip was beyond endurance on many of these ships a contemporary said the sense of misery and suffocation was so terrible in the tweendeckswhere the height sometimes was only eighteen inches so that the unfortunate slaves could not turn round were wedged immovably in fact and chained to the deck by the neck and legsthat the slaves not infrequently would go mad before dying or suffocating in their frenzy some killed others in the hope of procuring more room to breathe men strangled those next to them and women drove nails into each others brains it was not unusual john newton said to find a dead and living man chained together so many dead people were thrown overboard on slavers that it was said that sharks would pick up a ship off the coast of africa and follow it to america all negroes did not come this way there was a trickle of free immigrants from the west indies and some black men and women got on boats in africa and paid their way to america in for example the governor of georgia issued a certificate to fenda lawrence a free black woman and heretofore a considerable trader in the river gambia n on the coast of africa who hath voluntarily come to be and remain for some time in this province the certificate gave miss lawrence permission to pass and repass unmolested within the said province on her lawful and necessary occasions fenda lawrence of course was an exception most negroes came in chains followed by wise and greedy sharks the survivors of this gruelling ordeal were sold either on the ships or in slave markets in american ports in new england where there was a large retail demand slaves were sold in taverns stores and warehouses some were shown as the ads put it in the merchants homes some slave merchants sold negroes and whites liquor clothing and other goods one merchant for example advertised several irish maid servants timemost of them for five years oneirish man servant one who is a goodbarber and wiggmakeralso four or five likely negro boys the price of men like the price of butter fluctuated george washington for example bought a man slave for in but when he went to the market ten years later he had to pay slaves were sold for small down payments and on reasonable terms an advertisement of noted that the buyer shall have or months credit there was also a mailorder business one new englander noted in his diary that i wrote mr salmon of barbadoes to send me a negro the human factories in africa struggled to keep up with the demand in the eighteenth century between and negro slaves crossed the atlantic each year the greatest number by far went to the west indies and brazil at least two million were shipped to the west indies joao pandia calogeras the brazilian historian said at least eighteen million were shipped to brazil arthur ramos another brazilian thinks this figure is too high five million he says is a more accurate estimate large blocks of slaves were dropped off in spanish colonies in the caribbean and in central and south america as early as there were twenty thousand negroes in mexico some slaves were imported before slavery was abolished in mexico in the first quarter of the nineteenth century hundreds of thousands of slaves were scattered over the areas of presentday panama colombia ecuador chile peru and venezuela in venezuela had some negroes in a total population of in there were negroes in cuba and only whites in the same year there were negroes in brazils population of more than of the brazilian negroes incidentally were free widespread amalgamation and unreliable census data make it difficult to assess the impact of these millions of south american life but in some south american countries people with negro blood still comprise a considerable proportion of the population what gilberto freyre the brazilian sociologist and philosopher said of brazil is true for a great part of the new world every brazilian even if he is light skinned and has fair hair bears in his soul the shadow or the mark of the native or the negro of the negro particularly on the seaboard from maragnan to rio grande in the south and in the state of mines the influence of the african is direct or vague and remote in our way of expressing tenderness in our excessive mimicry in our catholicism which is a delight of the senses in our way of walking and talking in the songs which cradled our childhood in short in all the sincere expressions of our life the negro influence is patent for the human chattel involved the slave trade was a stupendous roulette wheel the boats fanned out from africa and scattered human freight over the western hemisphere around and around the wheel went stopping here and there sealing wherever it stopped the fate of mothers and fathers and their children to the nth generation it made a great deal of difference to the slaves where the dice of fate fellwhether they landed for example in a country where the word was the spanish yo or the french je or the english i slavery to be sure was a form of hell wherever it existed but there were gradations of hell dantesque circles as it were within circles by all accounts the britishprotestant colonies were the deepest pit the roman catholic colonies especially the portuguese and spanish colonies were by comparison relatively mild the french and spanish could be cruel and often were but they did not seem to be driven by the same demons that pursued the puritans they did not for example interfere as much in the personal lives of the slaves in the roman catholic countries african religious practices and other elements of african culture were not as vigorously opposed as they were in the protestant colonies the protestant colonies with an instinct for the jugular vein rode herd on tomtoms and joyful noises unto the lord the difference this made in social cohesion is roughly the difference between the successful haitian revolution and the abortive nat turner insurrection the final meeting of the haitian revolution was held at a vodun ceremony and the signal went out by tomtoms another difference minor perhaps but important to the people involved was the texture of the different societies the catholic countries were gay and colorful the protestant colonies by comparison were a dull shade of grey more important was the relative absence of color prejudice in spanish america and portuguese brazil this fact gave a certain tone to social intercourse and the life of a slave in these colonies was less hopeless and unhappy than the life of a slave in say south carolina in brazil there was a state officer a protector of slaves who looked after the welfare of the disadvantaged manumission was easier in brazil and spanish america and a manumitted slave inherited the rights and privileges of citizens there were several ways in which a slave could win freedom if he could earn his purchase price he could walk up to his master and hand him the moneyand the master had to accept it he could earn money on sundays and religious holidays another means of salvation was childbearing if slave parents had ten children in hispanic america the whole family went free the difference between hispanic america and protestant america reduces itself as so many racial problems do to the problem of sex for reasons that are not entirely explicable the spanish and portuguese were willing to marry negroes in america white men drew the line at marriage that is in america in the french english spanish dutch and danish colonies the slaves were given a new conception of themselvesaccording to the different lights of their captors this process whether it took place in liberal brazil or harsh south carolina was a painful mindreversing operation in which two or three out of every ten died in one form or another every slave from africa went through a breakingin period during this period which varied from one to three years the slave was taught pidgin english or french or spanish he got a new name and began to look at himself and others in a different manner yahweh took the place of olorum legba became st peter the mass or hymnal replaced voodo the strain was too much for tens of thousands some died from old and new diseases some refused to give up shango and wasted away others ran away and died of exposure still others committed suicidedrowning was popular in liberal brazil charles s johnson has given an excellent description of the breakingin process in south carolina in the early days of the plantation regime when a gang of fresh africans were purchased they were assigned in groups to certain reliable slaves who initiated them into the ways of the plantation these drivers as they were called had the right of issuing or withholding rations to the raw recruits and of inflicting minor punishments they taught the new slaves to speak the broken english which they knew and to do the plantation work which required little skill at the end of a year the master or overseer for the first time directed the work of the new negro who now had become tamed assigning him to a special task of plantation work along with the other seasoned hands who had long since learned to obey orders to arise when the conch blew at day clean to handle a hoe in listing and banking to stand still when a white man spoke the merchandising and marketing of men made millioinaires in england and america and many people shared in the profits on the eve of the american revolution says dr lorenzo j green it the slave trade formed the very basis of the economic life of new england about it revolved and on it depended most of her other industries the vast sugar molasses and rum trade shipbuilding the distilleries a great many of the fisheries the employment of artisans and seamen even agricultureall were dependent upon the slave traffic liverpool in england newport in rhode island nantes in france prospered as slave trading centers it was a common saying eric williams reports that several of the principal streets of liverpool had been marked out bv the chains and the walls of the houses cemented by the blood of the african slaves and one street was nicknamed negro row the red brick customs house was blazoned with negro heads the story is told of an actor in the town who hissed by the audience for appearing before them not for the first time in a drunken condition steadied himself and declared with offended majesty i have not come here to be insulted by a set of wretches every brick in whose infernal town is cemented with an africans blood the western world williams contends is in danger of forgetting today what the negro has contributed to western civilization london and bristol bordeaux and marseilles cadiz and seville lisbon and new england all waxed fat on the profits on the trade in the tropical produce raised by the negro slave capitalism in england france holland and colonial america received a double stimulation from the manufacture of goods needed to exchange for slaves woolen and cotton goods copper and brass vessels and the firearms handcuffs chains and torture instruments indispensable on the slave ships and on the slave plantation this contribution of the negro has failed to receive adequate recognition it is more than ever necessary to remember it today england and france holland spain and denmark not to mention the united states brazil and other parts of south america are all indebted to negro labor africans helped build liverpool nantes and newport they helped finance the industrial revolution in england they helped clear the forest in america they did these things but they protested every step of the way protests began in africa where mutinies on ships were common and continued in america where revolts were common the negroes captain thomas phillips said are so willful and loth to leave their own country that they have often leapd out of the canoes boat and ship into the sea and kept under water till they were drowned to avoid being taken up and saved by our boats which pursued them they having a more dreadful apprehension of barbadoes than we can have of hell tho in reality they live much better there than in their own country but home is home etc home being home etc many slaves revolted brained the captain and crew and escaped to the shore rebellions on ships were so common that a new form of insurance was introducedinsurrection insurance many slaves refused to eat when well and refused to take medicine when ill one man for instance attempted to cut his throat after the wound was sewed up he ripped out the sutures with his fingernails he was patched up again but refused to eat and died ten days later of starvation in the west indies and on the mainland there were many revolts a long series of conspiracies and revolts culminated in the great haitian revolution which played an important part in the abolition of the trade pushed by fear of the unmanageable slaves and pulled by humanitarian motives stemming from the american and french revolutions politicians abolished the trade in the nineteenth century it continued surreptitiously however until the final abolition of slavery in the united states the slave trade left a bloodstained legacy during the four centuries the trade was pursued it wrecked the social and economic life of africa set tribe against tribe and village against village the trade was no less disastrous in europe and america where it left a legacy of ill will and guilt and a potentially explosive racial problem raphael painted w e b du bois has said luther preached corneille wrote and milton sang and through it all for four hundred years the dark captives wound to the sea amid the bleaching bones of the dead for four hundred years the sharks followed the scurrying ships for four hundred years america was strewn with the living and dying millions of a transplanted race for four hundred years ethiopia stretched forth her hands unto god judge thurgood marshall by ernest e goodman he post of federal judge might prove unexciting to a lawyer who spent more than onehalf of his years before the bar of justice often pleading seemingly hopeless causes sometimes under extreme duress and even the threat of bodily harm but not for thurgood marshall who as judge of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit has found each day of his months on the bench as challenging as his years before it a graduate of the howard university school of law judge marshall was appointed to his present position by president kennedy in october and confirmed by the us senate months and many hearings later the cases which come before judge marshall today at the us courthouse overlooking new york citys foley square run the gamut admiralty criminal tax civil all types this court is the largest of its kind in the nation with the greatest variety of cases last year judge marshall participated in the hearing and decision of more than cases on appeal from us district courts this year the docket is even heavier but heavy schedules are not new to the foot pound jurist whose years as special counsel for the national association for the advancement of colored people were filled with workdays of hours or more then again he no longer is required to travel the miles a year that were necessary in his effort to obtain equal protection under the law for americas million negroes and although his present workload is somewhat lighter the length of his workday has shown no appreciable decrease his many other talents notwithstanding he never quite learned to relax today his evenings usually are spent poring over law books and examining case after case always with one thought in mind that of providing the same protection under the law for the parties involved in the cases before him that he sought for his clients during his naacp days to understand thurgood marshall one must go back to his boyhood days in baltimore racial discrimination and segregation were the way of life in baltimore in those days and young thurgood saw and felt these evils at every turn his father a railroad dining car worker and later steward at a country club and his mother a teacher in the public schools provided a comfortable home for him and his brother but outside the home were the everpresent humiliations of secondclass citizenship however his father was a man of principle as judge marshall puts it who told his sons that they not only had his permission but his orders to fight anyone who humiliated them because of their race about his father marshall says will marshall would sleep in the streets rather than betray his principles the same is said about judge marshall by those who know him it was while attending baltimores douglass high school that thurgood marshall developed an interest in the us constitution the document of which his knowledge years later was to earn for him the name of mr civil_rights judge marshall laughs today when he reflects on his introduction to the constitution it seems that in those days a form of discipline at douglass high consisted of sending the offender into the basement with instructions to read and memorize sections of the constitution i went to the basement so often judge marshall recalls that i knew the whole thing by heart before i reached my senior year after high school marshall enrolled at lincoln university in pennsylvania where he began a curriculum which would prepare him for dental school his plans for a career in dentistry were forsaken after he tried out for and won a position on the schools debating team this was the young students first experience at formal debating although argumentation had been one of his fortes since childhood one of the favorite pastimes at the marshall home had been the regular pro and con arguments between thurgood and his father on the issues of the day there were never any pros and cons on segregation however judge marshall says our only arguments on this subject were over the best methods of doing away with it marshalls success as a debater and the encouragement offered by his teammates combined to change his plans from dentistry to law marshall was graduated with honors from lincoln in june and enrolled in the howard law school three months later as an institution howard held no particular attraction for marshall at that time but the nations worst economic plight was setting in the university of marylands law school at baltimore barred negroes and howard had the most accessible and least expensive law school available to him then too during his travels as a debater he had met and come to admire charles h houston vice dean of the howard law school who was then pioneering in the field of civil_rights law throughout his three years at howard marshall commuted daily to and from baltimore a trip of some miles as a freshman he had to be up at am in order to make an eight oclock class then return to baltimore by midafternoon to one of the halfdozen or so parttime jobs which helped pay his tuition and transportation costs at the end of his freshman year marshall was the ranking student in his class thus qualifying for a job as student assistant in the law library the job paid the cost of his tuition but it also lengthened his day in washington during his second and third years of law school marshall rarely returned to baltimore before pm and the occasions were even fewer when he crawled into bed prior to midnight but the job of student assistant had its advantages too for one thing it gave marshall greater access to and knowledge of the books which were to become his bibles in later years then it put him in closer contact with houston who soon was to become his idol the howard law school had no formal course in civil_rights law in those days in fact it was not until when a young law professor from houston texas arrived on campus and introduced such a course that any american law school taught civil_rights as a part of its curriculum that young professor by the way is today the president of howard university dr james m nabrit jr in the early s those law students who showed real promise were selected by houston to participate in his informal civil_rights seminar which met two or three times a week in the law library not only was marshall an avid member of this group but midway his second year he was assisting in the preparation of briefs for actual civil_rights cases by the end of the year he was accompanying houston into many of the nations courtrooms it might come as a surprise even to those who knew the houstonmarshall team that the young law students first participation on a civil_rights brief was not for a houston case but for that of one of his colleagues professor william hastie who later was to become dean of the law school the case involved the right of a negro to enter the university of north carolina law school and the decision went against the plaintiff not too many years were to pass however before marshall would have a hand in changing such decisions no one seems to have greater admiration for marshall than hastie who today is himself a federal judge serving on the bench of the us court of appeals for the third circuit at philadelphia among judge hasties prize possessions is a contracts brief which marshall prepared as a student now and then i take it out and look at it again and still admire it hastie says marshall could talk for hours about the late charlie houston not only about his role as an outstanding lawyer but also his role as a scholar at whose feet a student was privileged to sit houston had three goals during his tenure at howard according to judge marshall he wanted first to raise the academic level of the law school secondly he wanted the negro lawyer to attain a position of respect and esteem and thirdly he wanted his students to become not just lawyers but social engineers before resigning his law school post in to accept the position of legal counsel for the naacp houston had accomplished all three objectives marshall was graduated at the top of his class in february and established his law practice in baltimore seven months later but the nation was still in the throes of a depression and marshalls practice reflected it judge marshall estimates that he lost during his first year as a lawyer things took a turn for the better during the second year and the young lawyer began to gain in reputation as well as financial solvency the latter gain proved to be shortlived though for the civil_rights bug again had bitten him increasingly he began to find himself handling such noteworthy but low paying legal actions the first major civil_rights case which marshall was to argue was murray v pearson in it involved the right of donald murray negro to enroll at the university of maryland law school in baltimore the school which marshall himself might have entered five years earlier had he been permitted marshall remembered this then too he remembered that he had helped prepare the brief on the similar university of north carolina case which had been lost for the murray case marshall was teamed with houston his friend and teacher so effective were the arguments of the team that the lower court ordered murrays admission to the school an unprecedented action in those days the state of maryland appealed but the decision was upheld at the appellate level houston was granted a sixmonth leave from his naacp post in and marshall was called to new york to replace him for the next two years his practice was divided between new york and baltimore with less and less time being spent in the latter city when houston resigned in to return to private practice marshall was named to succeed him as special counsel for the naacp well does judge marshall remember those early days in new york a salary and the walkup flat in harlem but the lack of luxury failed to bother him once you get into this business of civil_rights he said you dont think of money and get into it he did trade union discrimination restrictive covenants segregation in interstate travel racial exclusion from state universities unequal pay for negro teachers the white primary exclusion of negroes from jury duty and discrimination in the armed forces all were to fall before marshall and the battery of naacp lawyers during his first years on the job and although he trod dangerous grounds and had his life threatened on more than one occasion on his treks into the south even there he was winning the respect of many of his adversaries during his first year on the job marshall had an occasion to go to dallas texas to protest the exclusion of negroes from jury duty the young lawyer went directly to the governor james allred who was so impressed with his presentation that he not only ordered out texas rangers to protect the right of negroes to serve on juries but also volunteered to ask the fbi to study the situation then there was the time in when marshall was interrupted in the middle of the night by a telephone call from a southern city the caller informed him that a lynching party was gathering at the local jail and asked his help in averting a tragedy as was his custom marshall took the most direct avenue available to him he put through a call to a prominent attorney in the state saying look just two sets of people cant afford a lynching at this timeus negroes and you people youre right in the midst of a dixiecrat political campaign and a lynchings going to make you people look awful bad twenty minutes later the attorney called back the state troopers made it in time he said call this number in a few minutes your man will be there unharmed these instances were by no means typical of marshalls experiences with southern officials however many was the time when he had to enter and leave a town under cover of night although the reverse of this occurred one year in a small mississippi town there he was warned by the sheriff to leave before nightfall because of the towns reputation of not letting the sun set on a negros head then there was columbia tenn in marshall had been called to the town to defend several negroes accused of murder during a race riot because of the hostile atmosphere in columbia marshall and his legal colleagues took up residence in nashville and commuted miles each day it was on leaving columbia one day that marshalls car was forced off the road by several police cars out jumped eight to ten policemen their pistols brandished demanding to see marshalls driving permit the attorney produced his license and after a while the officers left but moments later the same police crew curbed marshalls car again this time charging him with being drunk and transporting liquor in his car they searched the car but found nothing so they left again hardly five minutes had passed before the same crew was back this time the charge was drunken driving and marshall was ordered to get out of the car and walk across the road to the magistrates office thurgood knew that terrible things had happened to negroes for resisting arrest in such cases so he refused to walk across the road unless escorted by the police after some debate the officers escorted him across the road to the magistrate where he stood breathing as hard as i could into his face judge marshall said he nearly used up all his breath in convincing the magistrate that he had not been drinking and was allowed to leave after that i really needed a drink marshall declared by word and deed the naacps preference in racial matters has been for persuasion rather than legal action but the hard core of resistance which the organization has met has left it with no alternative but the courts and it was in the courts that marshall was to earn his reputation as one of the greatest constitutional lawyers of all times marshalls talents were widely known in the legal profession and in the negro community well before but it was not until that year may to be exact that his name became a household word throughout america in the civil_rights cases of the s marshalls method had been to attack the inequalities of separate but equal facilities for the school cases he and his colleagues decided to go all out in an attack on segregation itself with the weight of precedent against them the naacp lawyers decided to use a new tack marshalling a group of some outstanding educators historians economists sociologists anthropologists psychologists and psychiatrists marshall co built their case on the premise that segregated education could not be equal an indication of the respect that marshalls opponents had for him is seen in the case of the state of south carolina rather than send its attorney general up against marshall south carolina called in john w davis dean of us constitutional lawyers to defend its separate but equal position when the supreme court handed down its unanimous decision in favor of the plaintiffs i was so happy i was numb marshall said the school desegregation decision was considered by many including judge marshall as the wedge to open the door to full citizenship for negroes but the best estimates at that time were that yet another generation of litigation would be needed before the goal could be fully realized marshall was opening the door wider and wider when tapped for the federal bench in there were misgivings in some quarters when marshall accepted the judgeship nabrit had assumed the presidency and spottswood robinson of richmond va the law deanship at howard robinsons partner oliver hill had accepted a government post and now marshall was leaving the field there was even some talk of a plot to rid the negro of his best civil_rights lawyers but marshall and his colleagues had no such misgivings we had built up a core of able young lawyers all over the country who could pick up the ball and run with it judge marshall said at naacp legal defense fund headquarters in new york there was to be a staff headed by jack greenberg and constance motley and including derrick bell michael meltsner rufus smith and james m nabrit iii the latter being the younger half of what marshall calls the finest fatherson team ive ever met today judge marshall can look back on a record before the supreme court that with the possible exception of john davis can be matched by no man cases wins and losses but marshall is not a man to look back besides his preoccupation with present duties has left him little time for reflection or anything else the honors and awards which have come judge marshalls way during his career number more than among these are the two highest given by howard universitythe alumni achievement award and the honorary degree of doctor of laws the latter being one of such degrees which have been conferred upon him and although marshall refuses to give priority to any one of his awards one cannot help but think that his greatest moment came when the naacp conferred the spingarn medal upon him in judge marshall does very little traveling now partly out of the desire to be at home with his family and partly because of his conception of what a judges role should be his speaking engagements by and large are limited to law groups and even his social contacts are restricted particularly where trial lawyers are involved at home there is little rest for the weary jurist his two young sons see to that thurgood jr age and fouryear old john william take over from the time he arrives for dinner until they are forced into their beds at pm only then can marshall relax briefly usually in front of the television set before dragging out another law book his wife the former cecilia suyat who once worked as a secretary at naacp headquarters tries to get him out to a play or movie at least once a week but even she meets with only moderate success cissy as judge marshall calls her is his second wife his first marriage to the former vivien burey of philadelphia ended after years with her death in judge marshalls prime concern at this time seems to be his sons and their development he says that they will get the best education money can buy will they be lawyers this will be left to them marshall admits however that he will not be at all unhappy if they select legal careers thurgood jrs sights already have been set chief judge j edward lumbard of his fathers court was visiting the marshall home one night recently when he encountered young thurgoods usual who are you where do you work what do you do interrogation after judge lumbard supplied the answers thurgood jr turned to his father and in a loud and stern voice announced i dont want to be just a judge i want to be chief judge rhodes scholar family by hans knight he street is called marchand street and i the section on which number the rented sixroom house of edgar wideman stands is not the newest in pittsburgh nor is it the oldest the sections name is east liberty the house is an unremarkable twostory structure of wood with an attic and a small backyard and if it is gathering a measure of fame these days it is not because of edgar wideman or his wife bette or his three boys and one girl who live in it the fame stems from the fact that this is the home of john wideman whose middle initial is e for edgar who is a student at pennsylvania university captain of its basketball team sometime quartermiler on the varsity track team member of phi beta kappa and the second american negro to win a rhodes scholarship one of educations prime trophies this entitles him to study for two years at oxford england john wideman came to penn under a benjamin franklin academic scholarship and he earns some of his meals waiting on table in the athletic training house edgar wideman stands six feet one a bare inch shorter than his son when he crooks his arms his biceps strain against the rolledup sleeves of his flannel shirt the muscles of which at he is unobstrusively proud result from basketball scrimmages at the boys club down the lane and from lifting cans of trash on to a truck mr wideman is a parttime garbage collector for the city of pittsburgh the city pays dollars and cents a day for this work when trash is plentiful as after christmas or thanksgiving mr wideman works two sometimes even three days a week some weeks he doesnt work he sings tenor in the choir of the homewood ame zion church to which the family belongs and in his spare time he is a freelance waiter at catered affairs its very convenient he said i start my collection rounds all over the city at am and im usually home by pm that gives me plenty of time to be a waiter in case anybody wants one in fact he added ruefully ive got too much time on my hands at his age he said a man looks for security he has taken the civil service examination for water meter reader and has been told that he came out sixth highest among some three hundred applicants therefore he said he was hopeful of getting the job one of these days he regretted he said that he didnt finish college he quit dentistry school at pittsburgh university after two years when his money ran out he worked briefly in the government printing office in washington after his marriage in pittsburgh john was bom in columbus hospital in washington mrs wideman said it was june flag day no less the birth is registered in the capital but we consider john a pennsylvanian mrs wideman is a tall slender woman with serious eyes she has been working at the gift counter of a city department store for five years ever since the children were old enough to go to school she earns about a week she rides the street car to work after sending the children off and she comes home about the children pitch in with the housework my main job she said is keeping the family together theres little time that we can all be home so we try to make the most of it we havent been blessed with material goods but we have the family i think thats important her husband smiled broadly yes he said thats one thing you dont have to be rich to enjoy neither edgar nor bette wideman can explain their sons scholastic successes he doesnt have it from me she said certainly not from me he laughed its something god gave him perhaps she said john the elder wideman said seemed to have the gift from the start he never worked very hard at it he said id come home and see him playing with friends in the street and ask him if hed done his studies and hed say oh okay ill get to it and the as just came he played as much as any boy he didnt sit and cram for hours it was just there on his garbage rounds wideman said people whove seen his picture in the papers and on television look at me hard and say arent you related to that john wideman are you his brother maybe then i say im his father and peopleall kinds of people rich and poor all racestake an interest and want to know how he did it and what hes going to do and they congratulate me but what did i do john did it himself john had always been interested in writing mrs wideman said she rummaged among some papers and brought out a copy of sermons in poetry a booklet published by the american poetry society in every night before i go to sleep i think of the pleasure from life that reap i think of the blessings and good times enjoy that would be like a dream to some other boy think of my family secure in affection and health and grow tired as ponder our immeasurable wealth then when l hear my parents mounting the stairs i bow my head and say my prayers thats the first thing he ever had published though he didnt get paid for it mrs wideman said he writes better now but i dont think hes changed his philosophy much but john himself had changed his father laughed i can still see him as a little boy his grandfatherjohn was the apple of the old mans eyewould take him out sunday morning lift him on his shoulders and carry him down the street like he was the prince of wales john attended liberty elementary school a twostory brick building on shadyside avenue where the family lived before moving to marchand street last fall years back said horton moon edgar widemans brotherinlaw whod dropped in with his wife catherine millionaires lived in that neighborhood then they moved away now other people live there including us the street in which john wideman grew up is lined with shaggy trees shading houses with colonial style porches john his father said associated with a variety of friends some were nice kids some were hoodlums but both the nice kids and the hoodlums liked john he had the ability to get along with everybody and i dont mean that hed give in to them i think it was something inside of him some strength some honesty that made them like and respect him he never had an enemy when hes home his friends come and invite him whites negroes except said mrs wideman i dont know how they feed him hes the biggest eater you ever saw favorite foods id say his favorite food is plenty just that plenty and spiced he puts sauce over everything by the time john wideman entered peabody high school hed already made something of a name for himself in the neighborhood as a basketball and football player he quit football when they brought him home one day with his face kicked in he took as naturally to sports as he did to learning his father said in fact he learned much from athleticsthat you cant always win but you can always try and that you have to keep in shape if you expect the best of yourself that you have to have selfdiscipline as well as ability the phone rang at that point for the fourth time in twenty minutes and edgar wideman sighed and answered it oh tisha he called upstairs wouldnt it help if you answered the phone all the calls are for you anyway letitia at the only sister to four brothers obediently came skipping downstairs im going to have a fiveminute limit on her conversations any day now wideman muttered let her save up for an answering service but daddy letitia wailed they hung up who was it only a girl her father said grimly and letitia breathed a relieved oh you should see john and tisha fight mrs wideman said john is a great teaser and tisha teases him back and off they go his son wideman said may be a celebrity outside but he isnt one at home nor does he want to be to us hes spanky thats the nickname i gave him when he was a boy and hes stuck with it oh dont say that said his wife john will never forgive you yes he will smiled his father the living room is small and neat its blue walls peeling in spots are decorated by two pictures john painted at the picturesone of a waxenfaced man with dark glasses against a garish neon sign backdrop the other depicting impressionistic horsemen won him an award in an arts contest sponsored by a city store john his father said loves to paint he even painted his aunts bedroom pink during a recent visit he loves music too modern and classical in a way im glad he never took up an instrument who knows with his touch he might have been great at it and then where would he be you can only do so much in one life for a while he was very interested in psychiatry so he wondered whether he shouldnt be a psychiatrist but he decided it would take him too long to finish then he wanted to be a psychologist i do think hes settled in literature he wants to teach and write he wants to write a great novel or play but hes also realistic he knows he has to have a job a regular profession and he likes teaching very much so hell be a teacher of english in college mrs wideman showed part of a letter john had written at christmas it spoke of gratitude for having a place he could call home it spoke of his inability to repay his parents for what theyd given him he did it all himself his father said his mother nodded agreement he read much his father said he read the greek classics for pleasure not because he had to last year his father recalled john engaged in one of his few business deals he bought a car from somebody for hed always wanted a car of his own well he brought it home proud as can be hed signed the papers without benefit of lawyers of course when he tried it out the second time the hood fell off since by coincidence it happened to be inspection time the authorities ordered the car off the streetunconditionally and forever he wished edgar wideman said quietly he could give his son a car when he graduates in may maybe mrs wideman remarked dryly youd better buy him a boat since hes going to england maybe youre right at that her husband agreed amiably if the widemans are frankly proud of their oldest son theyre equally proud of their other children otis david robert and letitia they hope they will be able to go to college they dont think theyll be able to help them much financially any more than they could help john theyre all good in their own way mrs wideman said as for the children they have taken johns distinctions with aplomb that saturday night when john telephoned her the news mrs wideman yelled to letitia tisha spankys a rhodes scholar the girl merely shrugged but said her mother hes already got a phi beta kappa key so has president kennedy letitia said evenly and swept out of the room how to win the rat race problem with surriviving the threat of i nuclear annihilation freeway traffic and riots on the ole miss campus is that survival still leaves you alive in the rat race this is a condition preferable perhaps to death but just barely nevertheless if youre going to be stuck in the pressure cooker of modernday living the cliche if you cant beat em join em is just no longer good enough it is not sufficient to merely join the rat race you must become good at it in the interest of ascertaining what qualities or guide rules are necessary in gaining proficiency at ratracing we have interviewed scores of successful businessmen and found the formula to be simple nothing so mundane as hard work or so oldfashioned as marrying the boss daughter or even so naive as the golden rule but simple nonetheless it should be pointed out at this time that these rules apply primarily to the business world where ratracing has been developed to a high art the soundness for concentrating in this area is based on the fact that you will need money as long as you live and while it really cant buy happiness it does make a nice down payment thus with the thought of success in the world of money in mind we come to rule one be sincere sincerity is described in the dictionary as the quality of being without deceit pretense or hypocrisy the reason for being sincere is that to be insincere is to run the risk of being uncovered as a scoundrel and an opportunist nothing could be more damaging to your chances of success than to have your boss learn that all those times you asked him about his wife and kids all the concern you showed for his ulcer and all the admiration you have evidenced at his great wisdom and keen intellect was simply to put him on therefore the rule is be sincerewhether you mean it or not rule two never lie the problem with lying is that it sometimes requires betterthanaverage creative powers and frequently demands an excellent memory the average person has enough trouble trying to remember what has actually happened let alone something that didnt occur at all besides lying is as bad as insincerity and morally indefensible in the final analysis there is but one exception to this rule only one occasion when lying is permissible that is whenever it will make things easier for you rule three be decisive getting ahead in life invariably re quires learning to make decisions this is especially important in the business world in your struggle to achieve success however you should avoid making really important decisions for there is always the possibility that your decisive action may reveal you as having an inadequate grasp of the facts or inferior mental powers instead you might wait to get the boss opinion then quickly agree with him this is sure to mark you as a bright perceptive fellow turn your mind instead to deciding such matters as whether to find a good excuse to get out of the office for the afternoon or go goof off down at the water fountain incidentally the water fountain is your best bet often a piece of office gossip picked up there can if properly exploited be far more valuable in advancing your career than weeks of hard work which is not to be recommended anyway rule four accept responsibility the principle of accepting responsibility is one we learn at childhood and practice the rest of our lives while it is usually considered a burden there are certain subtle and ingenious ways in which this can actually become a magic carpet to success let us say for instance that your boss is highly enthusiastic about a report prepared by you and a coworker and happens to drop by your desk to tell you so at a time when your partner is out to lunch a seemingly casual but careful acceptance of responsibility at this point can be invaluable you might answer the boss compliments with something like oh that well as long as you like it sir it was worth my staying up all night to write the final draft or better still it was really pretty easy once i got anderson around to my way of thinking the fact that anderson wrote the entire report without your being able to understand what the hell any of it was about has nothing to do with it the responsibility is there for you accept it rule five make sacrifices this is one of the toughest things for young men on their way up to realize that they must be willing to make sacrifices the bookkeeper in one eastern firm understood this fact of life well however and when a shortage was discovered in his books one day he sacrificed his assistant his secretary and by the time he got through pointing his fingerhalf of the office force his willingness to make sacrifices of this sort eventually earned him a vice presidency rule six invite criticism if you are going to truly succeed you must learn to accept indeed even encourage critical analysis of workaday actions you must realize that there is absolutely nothing wrong with healthy constructive criticismespecially if it is not directed at you you may learn to adopt the proper attitude toward this important business tool by using it on your fellow workers whenever the opportunityin the form of the bosspresents itself so there you have them a halfdozen rules guaranteed to get you well ahead in the rat race a position you can easily maintain by keeping a wary eye out for anybody sneaky enough to use your system the time is now by dr broadus n butler we are deeply impressed by two facts about the present employment and career horizon for xt a young negro men and women one of them is bold and encouraging the other should be a matter of grave concern to us all the bold fact is that the dedicated labors of the many organizations and people who have striven for equal employment opportunity have begun to come to harvest and opportunity is real now the fact about which there should be grave concern is that neither the young people nor their parents nor their counselors with few exceptions have achieved a full appreciation and realization of what this means it can be said with complete justification and validity that until the past year equal opportunity or even opportunity itself in any genuine sense was a kind of nebulous thing that made good platitudes but did not really exist for young negro men and women in the important sectors of our national and economic life it is no wonder that they could not be easily motivated to engage the strenuous effort of high preparation for careers which they were at the same time being impressed that they would be denied however it can now be said with equal validity that so radical a change has taken place over the past year that the mantle is upon our shoulders now to produce young men and women to assume the responsible roles that now cry for them and now find them neither sufficiently motivated nor yet fully prepared in the sense of discipline not in the sense of capacity to gird themselves to assume we are so rapidly approaching the dream and the hope expressed by langston hughes when he said o let my land be a land where liberty is crowned with no patriotic wreath but opportunity is real and life is free equality is in the air we breathe the most degrading and depressing consequences of employment discrimination have been that it has made the potential man look down and has sunk that potential mans aspirations and achievements so far below the level of his inherent capacities that it not only demeaned and degraded the man but it deprived society of the full measure of what would have been that fully developed man any person tends to see things at his own eye level so if our youth do not raise their sights or have their sights elevated they will not even now see the real opportunities and concomitant responsibilities there are for competent confident responsible and adequate young men and women in this day industry is calling for young executives where are they skilled trades are calling for young negro men to return to them where are they technology is calling for men of science and research where are they government is calling for civil service executives for classifications g and above where are they cities states and the nation are looking for capable and responsible office holders where are they agencies of stock exchanges and banking and finance are looking for brokers and analysts where are they educational institutions and boards of education need able and visionary policy makers who will avoid the inadequacies of the past and have the courage to build an educational foundation adequate to the needs of the future where are they houses and communities which are not yet homes and neighborhoods are calling for young men and young women who can make houses homes in the real sense of family life and make communities neighborhoods in the positive reciprocity of neighborliness where are they they are in our schools and collegessome of them they have dropped out of school and are not working at allsome of them a relatively recent report showed that almost half of the best students in high school still do not enter college they are working odd parttime jobssome of them they are working jobs out of proper classificationsome of them they have resigned themselves to jobs that are well below their performance capacitiessome of them they are confused and discouragedsome of them wherever they are they must be found and counseled and encouraged they must have the confidence in themselves to explore and to keep exploring above all they must quickly acquire that added measure of competence qualification and confidence which transforms a youth into a man to this end we need more or ganized efforts to bring promising young people together under an entirely different definition of purpose frankly we have had the day of massive mobilization of resources for annual dances we need less social club emphasis and more preprofessional and prebusiness club emphasis we need fewer social fraternities and more career orientated fraternities and sororities among such clubs and fraternities we must get well beyond future teachers clubs to add future engineers clubs future architects clubs future diplomats clubs future executives clubs future politicians clubs future writers clubs future poets clubs future businessmen clubs and so on fathers mothers and counselors ours is now the responsibility to gain more knowledge of the realities of this new day and to guide and inspire our youth to a sense of the fullness of the opportunity that now prevails for them to explore and to realize the full range and extent of their capacities without regard to previous restrictions their sights and personal horizons need breadth their personal sense of confidence competence and adequacy needs depth their sense of projection purpose and potentialities needs length their aspiration levels need height their sense of their own dignity and value as persons needs unfolding their knowledge of the heretofore inaccessible tools and instrumentalities of knowledge and training for the full development of whatever capacities they possess needs fulfillment even in northern colleges and universities only onethird of negro students are men twothirds are women the majority of these men are looking to fields of teaching medicine and law the majority of the women have been conditioned to seek careers in teaching nursing and social work fields while the needs in these fields should not be overlooked we must set the sights of our young men and women far beyond these to the more diversified roles and responsibilities which our economy our society and our nation are already begging for them to assume today this is the new meaning of the discipline that is incumbent upon parents and counselors as well as youth in this day because more than anything else our young men need to regain the lost or suppressed meaning of what it is to be a male man with a male image of adequacy responsibility and selfrealization commensurate with the responsibility of a free man questing to develop and utilize his creatorendowed talents this is their task and ours instead of systematically suppressing and demeaning and disvaluing our youth and leading them through successive stages of submission and forced retreat into the bramble bushes and hazy thicket of feelings of inferiority and inadequacy so please wake up young men young women gird yourselves for the longer and more demanding preparation for an earlier assumption of more mature more real responsibilities than your fathers and mothers were privileged to do little more than dream of in their lifetimes dont stop dont dropout persevere it is only six years now between george shirley student at wayne state university virtually unknown beyond his family and his instructors to george shirley worldacclaimed star of the metropolitan opera company compare this to the long years of preparation and discipline

and promising detroit architect and corporate member of the american institute of architects it is only a few years but difficult disciplined and aspiring years young men young women now are the few years that you have to prepare yourselves for the call to highest positions of responsibility in industry finance government diplomacy science technology skilled labor and fields yet to emerge where the need is for you at your highest level of competence and preparation it is at the higher levels that your knowledge and skill and devotion will be the factors which will loom so large that the effects of so long years of discrimination and segregation will be so diminished as to become negligible by dr f we could probe the innermost secrets of some weary negro sharecropper in the south or a persecuted black muslim in a northern city mosque we might find him ever so briefly enjoying the wish that russia and white america would blow each other up and leave negroes to live on in peace but the unfortunate and strangely neglected fact is that the negros probability of being decimated is much higher than that of whites although he would hold a number of useful advantages in a nuclear war why then has such an important subject been gagged in the barrage of research and verbiage on the negro and on the nuclear threat why would scholars who have studied and bisected the negro in all of his ramifications from the negro as seen by the mulatto and the negro as seen by himself to the ecological distribution of negroes and georgia pines pass up the glaring question of the negros relative exposure and immunity to nuclear annihilation much of the neglect may be a product of the fallacy that since wars are waged between territorial and political blocs called nations all persons therein confined are equally subject to a common enemys destruction on the contrary sociologists have found a consistent relationship for example between income level and the tendency to die in wartime the lower an individuals family income the greater his chance of dying in battle the reason is probably that the lower classes produce more combat soldiers while the higher classes serve rather frequently as officers and as strategists then there are the critical occupationsnot to mention political offices to be filledwhich keep more of the higher classes safe in civilian life however the question of our concern is not simply a matter of social class it exists as we shall see in the racial condition of the negro per se there is in the first place the ecological fact that the negro race is ghettoed in black belts now more properly called i thinkblack corsets near the centers or bullseyes of our big cities bullseyes and sitting ducks professor karl taeuber of the university of chicago and one of the foremost authorities on the concentration and location of the races in this country recently discovered that negroes are less dispersed residentially than even puerto ricans even though they puerto ricans havent been in the city as long and have an inferior economic status in a speech before the board of directors of the chicago urban league he reported a study financed by the ford foundation which found that five out of every six u s cities having more than white households in had indexes of residential segregation above complete segregation would show an index of and absolute nonsegregation an index of this is especially so in large cities chicagos segregation index for example rose during the past decade from to this means that negroes in our big cities now live in bullseyes enclosed by white satellite suburban rings the u s census for shows suburbs known to be devoid of a single negro inhabitant and likewise in washington d c the capital of the nation for example whites have dwindled to a numerical minority moreover the concentration of negroes in these black corsets is on the increase my computations from u s census data show negroes for the first time in more urban than whites per cent to and the change in the negros urban proportion during the decade was more than twice as large as that of whites in addition more than nine out of ten of all negroes living outside the south west north central north east sections more likely to attract enemy warheads and missiles live in cities indeed the central cities of the largest u s metropolitan areas new york los angeles chicago philadelphia detroit san franciscooakland boston pittsburgh st louis washington cleveland baltimorenow hold three out of five of the negroes living outside the south and one out of every three in the entire country assuming that such large central cities as the foregoing would be priority targets let us calculate the relevance of the negros distribution to a nuclear attack as a preface to our treatment of the social psychology of the negros survivability say russia does drop a megaton bomb on washington d c or chicago for example up to five miles from ground zero the point of the explosion nine out of ten of all inhabitants would be killed instantly and the rest seriously injured or victimized by radiation all structures would be demolished from to miles out half of the inhabitants would be killed a third of them injured all others dazed shocked and sickened by radiation and all buildings damaged beyond repair in other words this would just about take care of the negro community on the other hand from to miles out only per cent of the individuals would be killed per cent injured seriously the others slightly or not at all while buiidings would require considerable repairs only two per cent of persons more than miles out largely white areas and beyond would be killed while four out of five would go mainly unhurt and damage to property would be minor although we have assumed that the attack would occur by night the picture would be much the same if the attack should come during the school hours of the day as children for examplethe future of a raceare sent to school in relation to their residence more than half of philadelphias elementary schools are either per cent white on the one hand or per cent negro on the other and per cent of chicagos negro pupils attend virtually allnegro schools persons at work during a daytime attack would offset the pattern considerably but studies show a tendency for people to try to live as near as possible all things considered to their place of work although this is less true of whites employed in the central district and at the higher income levels thus at any given moment during the hour cycle the majority of negroes are in or near the heart of the cities while the whites predominate in the outer rings of the metropolitan community this is especially so at night you cant hide here in spite of all of the foregoing if there are shelters in the black belt no one knows where they are says a chicago defender editorial october with an average income about smaller than the average white familys and with more mouths per family to care for the typical negro couldnt afford a shelter if he wanted to not that this makes that much difference slum dwellings and shelters near the center of the city would amount to incinerators anyway from the blast itself in part but also because the trash and debris of the fireprone buildings would be more subject to fire storms true a few negroes caught away from the center and shelterless may be admitted to one as a guest but most prospective shelterhosts would be white and the negro intruder probably would not be permitted even to place his feet on the welcome mat however with the chaos and the breakdown of social control the government itself plans to go underground it may be a bit too idealistic to expect individuals to obey current laws regarding property rights people might just fall into any fallout shelter in sight and it is not hard to imagine a negro maid or handyman suddenly taking authority and demanding space beside the white boss in his shelter but even on the shareyourshelter plan there would not be anywhere near enough whites themselves are said to have more swimming pools than they have shelters realizing this the government now is stressing community or mass shelters but there is no reason to expect that in these tombs of human moles the negro would receive any more of his share than he does in the serenity of the present day particularly in prejudiced localities there would be no time to stage a hidein or a shelterin no naacp to take it to the supreme court and no national guardsmen or u s marshals to call out even if the attorney general could be found thus the negro would find himself with no place to hide even in the matter of evacuation there probably would be no way out living in the central city fenced in by whites he would have a longer distance to go but a shorter time to travel five miles from a megaton explosion the heavier fallout would reach the ground in half an hour but twenty miles away there would be nearly an hour to get ready or evacuate also open country and highways would not be far away from the suburbs while all through the congested black corsets the narrow crisscross sometimes winding streets would be hopelessly jammed with wrecked autos and frantically honking cars containing by then negro wrecks even a warning signal would have done them little good survivability or postattack hustling some experts have raised the question wouldnt the survivors envy the dead anyway they refer to the enduring hazards of fallout and enemy attack on the one hand but particularly the emotional shock of emerging lost and separated from the persons and things once held important to face the turmoil and destruction of the postattack environment much of the problemthey feelwould revolve around the breakdown of law order and morality and the frustrations of extreme social and psychological insecurity thus notwithstanding the negros special exposure to the blast and his narrow chances of escaping or absorbing direct attack those remaining might prove better equipped to survive in some respects than whites especially in the psychological sense the negros superiority in psychological survivability is a product of the contrasting experiences and conditioning of the two races in this country for example even in the physical sense of enduring the intense heat likely to prevail in a fallout shelter many negroes possess cottonchopping cottonpicking backgrounds in the southern sun and long years of tending ovens and furnaces in white kitchens and factories which in this case would be to their advantage in the social or psychological sense negroes are far more conditioned to hard times and suffering they know what it is to have to hustle from check to check and in many cases from one meal to the next much of the shock that whites would experience in the postattack environment of deprivation and social inconsistence would seem commonplace to negroes for they have known a world of agony from the middle passage and plantation slavery down to the present regimes of the south and the southernyfied north in contrast to white persons they would not be so prone to suicide judging by past and present rates and their ability to stand up under stress and torture also may have been evident in the korean war in korean prisonerofwar camps it was recorded that negro pows were much less likely to defect to the side of the communistsquiet as it is kept on the other hand the negros condition would of course present a tremendous handicap to him many for one thing would find themselves unprepared to follow the fourth key to household safety issued by the office of civil defense it reads brusquely close all windows and doors and draw the blinds but many such fixtures in low income negro homes would be in need of repair with broken and jammed windows and blinds ready to come tumbling down if tugged too hastily also even negroes who have heard of geiger counters and such instruments for detecting radioactivity generally cannot afford them this may be one reason why so many have taken a returntosender attitude with regard to such pamphlets sent out by the office of civil defense but that is not the only reason a peaceable race in the peace race although negroes are wellnoted for their patience and piety and now boast of their facility in this regard as exhibited in the passive resistance campaign they have been conspicuously shy of peace movements as such while professing to be a peaceable race they have disdained the peace race for fear of seeming unamerican thus they have been lured by white superpatriots into the most unamerican tendency in the ideal sense historically speaking that this country has ever known in the fashion of the typical white citizen of our day the negro has become what c wright mills the late sociologist of columbia university called cheerful robots mills wrote this in his book the causes of world war iii which was an expansion of his sidney hillman lectures delivered at howard university in march of he noted that cheerful robots white and black sit back and accept with glee and indifference without question anything white leaders present to them as reality regarding international relations indeed some professors lecturing in negro college classrooms on war and related phenomena have had to pause midway and ask the students please to arouse some snoozing classmate even the grandiose negro leadership conference on africa recently held at impressive columbia university uniquely bringing together more than negro representatives of some different organizations had as its theme the integration of negroes into the existing scheme of things untouched while these leaders justly issued a plea for more negro diplomats and demanded that white policymakers let negroes know all about the full details of all us dealings with africa the only direct effort they made to improve or contribute to us foreign policy was to try to sic white america on south africa they wanted the us to cast the first stone and chastize white south africa for mistreating local africans in domestic relations thus in spite of all the picturetaking and speechmaking at the conference it was no refutation of the sad truth that there is a paucity of concern among those most in jeopardynegroes as we have seenin the event of a nuclear war while it is possible only to speculate on the relative survivability of whites and negroes in a nuclear war figures are convincing and it is hoped that neither will ever face the test however there is one thing apparent negroes had better go ahead and take over the battle for peace now bleakly muddled by the whites of the world before it is too late even to call on st peter for help who is to blame n the past this magav zine has been criti cized for not admonishing negro americans of their faults our editorials tend too frequently to concentrate on the failures of whites their lack of charity for the negro minority their neglect of the requirements of justice where we may have failed the july harpers magazine and its hardhitting editor john fischer have registered devastating blows in a severe editorial later reprinted in readers digest editor fischer lashes out at the negro and his failure to shoulder a bigger responsibility for the fix hes in there is no use denying his stern allegations they are undoubtedly true but as is so often the case their full import is a matter of perspective and of emphasis the faults of the negro are present for all to see the responsibility for these faults is not so easy to discern the correction of them we submit is not simply a matter of negro responsibility once more as so often in the past we return to an insistent reminder of ours the failure of the negro to take his place as a first class citizen does not rest on his shoulders alone and even if a greater proportion of blame is to be attributed to the negro again we insist that any effort to distribute responsibility in a country as large as ours and with the history that lies behind race relations becomes a futile pastime of pot and kettle exchanging invectives we come back to our old position social tensions and outright crime in the united states today are not a matter of one segment of the population alone for that reason we do not like mr fischers constant use of the phrase negro community you cannot separate criminal activity into neat compartments of one group alone while such neat divisions of responsibility may satisfy the demands of a certain type of tidy thinking they frequently fail to register the correct balance crime and its correction are the product of joint correlative action for every dope addict in harlem we can point to white pushers and white smugglers who control the trade in narcotics for every knifing and mugging we can point to an entire chain of law enforcement agencies that are an insult to community trust for every pariah on our welfare lists there stands a battery of silent partners labor racketeers rentgougers and slumlords whose power and influence keep them outside the pale of law for years on end no it is not the socalled negro community alone that must be brought to book in this indictment we americans are a people a community of white and colored with a sacred trust a public philosophy to sustain and cherish every criticism of negro failure must be examined side by side with white failure responsibility must be matched with responsibility it is too easy for one group to denounce the other to hold up standards that must be met before we agree that the negro has earned his citizenship that prize was conferred on the negro long before the editors of harpers and readers digest were born let them make sure that the nation as a whole deserves the quality of citizenship it demands of its most vexed and underprivileged

league talent during the summer of when the name maury wills was merely an eyebrowlifter in most baseball circles a yearold los angeles dodger fan watched with bugeyed awe as maury practiced his profession then returned home to pen this prophecy in rhyme the league will soon learn hes no one to spurn as he dazzles the crowds with his speed when he steals a base its not even a race cause he runs like a thoroughbred steed that lad whomever he was wouldve been eligible for full pardon last fall if he had thrown out his teenage chest to big daddy proportions and boasted to his friends i told you so for indubitably maury wills had confirmed his youthful poets appraisal in the short span of a single major league season maury wills turned baseballs clock all the way back to preruthian days brought the lovers of scientific baseball out of their bombshelters where theyd sought protection from a year barrage of homers with broad smiles on their faces taught dodger fans that as president walter omalley said you dont have to bump the ball over the wall to win games andif i may borrow eloquent words once spoken in tribute to joe louis by i believe the late new york mayor james

identifies all the horatio alger pluckandluck yarns ever written the theory that early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise aesop would have loved maury wills he would have written a book of bromides about him put it this way it is the fact of baseball as it is a fact of life that many of the sureshots never come in while some of the longshots do many of the preps voted mostlikelytosucceed arent ever heard of after the diplomas are passed out while some mousy little kid in the back row grows up to become president of a billiondollar firm many of the flashy highbonus boys of baseball fizzle in the hot glare of professional competition while an unpretentious little fellow who keeps on plugging along ignoring slights suddenly develops into the comethrough clutchman when the chips are down thats the maury wills story in a nutshell every last word of it hes the longshot who came in and paid off at milliontoone odds the los angeles dodgers lost the national league pennant he didnt in the last two pennant playoffgames with the san francisco giants while the dodgers were cutting their own throats maury stole four bases he brought home the winning run in the second game when he singled stole second went to third on a sacrifice and scored on a short fly in the final game he stole second stole third and raced home when the giant catcher threw wildly into the outfield trying to nab him in the background of these heroics there is to be found an incredible saga of dedication sticktoitiveness and big heart thats been matched seldom if ever since baseball was known as one o cat when a man appraises the hardships and disappointments that maury wills endured while striving for the major leagues of baseball if he is the sort of guy who beefs because the boss didnt say hello this morning he must be now reminded of the pointed saying i complained because i had no shoes until i met a man who had no feet maury wills is a little david whos made it big in a sport dominated by giant goliaths simply because he didnt quit as he says didnt get my diaper down when the powersthatwere continued to say youre too small youre good field no hit yesyoure pretty goodbut in when maury graduated from cardozo high school in washington d c nine colleges and universitiesincluding ohio state rutgers and syracuse dangled attractive athletic scholarship offers before him a potential a student whod make cs because like so many athletes i didnt concentrate enough on books maury passed over the offers because he was already married to his high school sweetheart gertrude elliott he was a father and at his family responsibilities dictated that he earn as much money as he could as quickly as he could hed been a fine high school quarterback quite some shucks as a prep pitcher and hed hit better than inspired by jackie robinson maury decided to seek his fortune in baseball but alas and alack after hed displayed his wares in a new york giants tryout camp at havre de grace marylandstriking out men in seven innings which is as perfect as baseball law allowsgiant scouts said he wouldnt do he was they said too small their goodbye was cordial but its effect was basically the same as an unfriendly order get out the giants like most everyone else in baseball were thinking along ruthian power lines thats understandable the ruthian influence being as dominant as it was even today maury stands only fivefootten but looks shorter weighs pounds he says but he must mean after hes taken a shower in his fulldress uniform maury was disappointed nobody can blame him for that but he didnt latch onto a persecution complex hurray he had a family to feedand blues arent edible when the dodgers then located in brooklyn held a tryout camp there he was showing em what he could do just as hed shown the giants the dodgers signed him gave him an infinitesimal bonus and ye gads they do say that dave nicholson who hit for the orioles last year was paid grand then promptly dumped him into their farm system where they forgot him for eight and a half years during that time maury bounced around like a basketball in the hands of marques haynes from hornell n y to spokane by way of pueblo colorado and some place in texas every year the dodgers looked at numerous phenoms but had no use for maury wills nobody else wanted him either incidentally maury stole bases at hornell in his first year of professional play returned to hornell in and to prove his previous seasons mark was no fluke stole another a hundred times or more during these eight and a half years as maury watched dozens of phenoms most of whom are now lodged somewhere in oblivion pass him by in a continuous parade to the parent dodger club he wondered did i do the right thing when i went into baseball he has explained it wasnt so much for myself that i was worried it would have been different if id been a single man i worried for my family i didnt want my family enduring all the hardships i had to endure finally i compromised myself stopped eating my heart out about making the major leagues and decided to make the best living i could in the minors now we dissolve to the major league season the los angeles dodgers are making a bold dash for the national league pennant they stumbled of course butwhat the heckthey were dashing boldly at one time and e j buzzie bavasi club vicepresident scoops writers at midseason by declaring that maury wills is the most valuable player on our club leo durocher a dodger coach who was himself a fine shortstop once and later the manager of two fine shortstops alvin dark and peewee reese says wills is the most versatile shortstop ive ever i seen walter omalley whod i feared hed built his million i stadium in los angeles chavez i ravine too big for his power boys i relaxes as he listens to the rafter i rattling cheers for maurys sleight i offoot tricks legions of writers i and fans compare maury wills to i the immortal ty cobb maury i wills to jackie robinson maury i wills to a forgotten national i league star bob beschler of cin i cinnati who stole bases in i to set a modern national league i record in when cobb set the alltime singleseason record of stolen bases he averaged a theft every games wills in averaged a heist every games fresco thompson covice president of the dodgers was asked to compare maury and ty its difficult to compare them said thompson because theyve played in eras where the type of game was entirely different in cobbs era one run was more important than it is in todays type of baseball where teams seem to go for the big inning believe a player who steals bases today would compare favorably with a player who stole in cobbs era this sounds like thompson is saying wills would have or could have stolen close to bases in cobbs timethat is when you remember that hes comparing thefts to thefts and in reality maury pilfered sacks in but lets be honest thompson was queried at midseason and neither he nor anyone else actually believed at that time that wills would erase ty cobbs mark a mark which for sheer effort and talent was more demanding or tougher this writer believes than babe ruths feat of home runs in the national league allstars and the american league allstars clashed in their first annual game of at washington dc wills though voted the no shortstop behind pittsburghs dick groat ran wild as of his relatives watched proudly and the national leaguers won this was the day when thanks to television and the importance of the occasion maury wills bolted into national if not international famehis performance in the world series when he outplayed chicagos thenheralded shortstop luis aparicio notwithstanding when the same two sets of allstars appeared in chicago for their second annual game of superlatives at wrigley field i corralled such creditable experts as stan musial the incomparable st louis cardinal del crandall milwaukees fine catcher and fred hutchinson manager of the cincinnati reds and asked each one for an appraisal of maury wills the thief of bases they chorused hes the best i tried to pin musial down to a shortstop comparison of wills to marty marion his old teammate stan hedged but there was no hedging about wills the baserunner crandall said the only way he knew of getting wills out was to throw to third when maury headed for second but at this time roughly midseason not every one who mentioned maury wills name conceded that he was an ecclesiastical performer subject not to critical analysis only to lavish praise which proves these fellows didnt know historyinthemaking when they saw it but who did vin scully the irrefutably great dodger broadcaster proved to be an uncompromising jackie robinson loyalist tough inadvertently he was forced to pay maury a lefthanded compliment wills is a nice little guy who steals bases robinson was a runner he had a defiance he was the only player i ever saw who could steal better when he was mad wills has everyone pulling for him to steal and cheering him when he does ive seen robinson steal when the crowd was booing and defying him to try it and furious when he succeeded bavasi enlarged on that robinson and wills are two oppositetype players robbie was more daring but not as quick nor as fast as maury one was more powerful the other is more agile and they are definitely different type hitters in my mind they were and are the most valuable players on our club so it went as the season progressed one was defiant the other nice one was more powerful the other more agile one was more daring the other quicker meanwhile jackie robinson entered the hall of fame wills became the greatest individual baseball star of the year and it all boiled down throwing the two togetherthat a stolen base was a stolen base was a stolen base incidents like those that follow enabled maury to dominate the sports year in houston on june he walked to lead off the th inning promptly stole second base sliding safely in on his belly because it was a game situation and i can save a halfstep sliding head first three pitches later he stole third with a hook slide and after willie davis flied to center he fled home scoring the winning run for the dodgers without the benefit of a hit said manager walt alston wills is the greatest basestealer ive seen in the majors in the aforementioned first major league allstar game at washington on july wills was sent in as a pinchrunner for musial whod singled in the top half of the sixth inning wills promptly stole second so cleanly that earl battey the american league catcher and a fine thrower didnt even bother with an attempt to get him out wills has explained i steal per cent of my bases on pitchers although catchers get most of the blame moments later dick groat singled and wills scampered home with the games first run when wills whod relieved groat at shortstop by this time stepped up to home plate as the leadoff batter in the eighth inning the national leaguers held a slender to lead he singled to left field as jim davenport also singled to left wills rounded second base and stopped mesmerizing rocky colavito who fielded davenports hit held the ball a costly moment then threw behind the runner to second base as soon as colavito committed himself wills took third shortly thereafter felipe alou hit a foul fly which leon wagner caught in short right field wagner may not be the worlds greatest thrower but neither is he the worlds worst and any scoring attempt by anybody or anything save greased lightning seemed strictly suicidal but the mercurial wills a positive thinker bolted home and slid deftly under john romanos frantic futile tag the national leaguers won the game to wills had scored two himself in a dodger home game against the new york mets on august wills again provided the margin of victory with his dashing feet in the sixth inning he beat out an infield single stole second advanced to third on a wild throw by met catcher chris cannizzaro and scored on willie davis infield hit wills stolen base in this game was his th of the year at this point the experts the better gamblers among them conceded that maury might erase beschlers national league singleseason record of stolen bases virtually no one not even wills himself envisioned that hed bag more how did maury wills bridge the gap between a compromise on comparative minor league oblivion and major league superstardom during the course of a fourhour taped interview for which maury is yet entitled to collect a steak dinner from the writer which sooner or later he will collect the star provided the complete answer to that question when i stole all those bases at hornell he said i ran mostly on sheer speed but as i moved up the ladder into classa aa triplea and so on i discovered that the pitchers were getting smarter they forced me to adjust they made me smarter i said fred hutchinson tells me that one reason why youre so good at stealing bases is that you get a better jump on pitchers than most runners del crandall says you study pitchers and basestealing in general more than most runners wills said yes i do study the pitchers constantly i try to detect little telltale signs little tips as to when i should take off from the movements of their heads and their shoulders their feet and that reminds me of something since that first allstar game last summer numerous reporters have asked me about basestealing and ive talked too much four pitchers made adjustments in their mannerisms on the moundthat means ive had to readjust to them but back to study i want to speak a good word for the dodgers they run a terrific training camp at vero beach every spring a campanis gives six or eight lectures on baserunning each training season i dont think ive forgotten a word ive heard him speak on the subject maury didnt mention it but when the dodger brass gave an exhaustive test dealing with various inside aspects of baseball play last spring he was the only player on the club to score i asked how important is raw sheer speed to a base bandit wills replied you have to have speed of course but the fastest runner isnt necessarily the best stealer of bases willie davis is faster than i am but im quicker the most important components of success in basestealing are knowing the pitcher knowing how to get a good lead and having the reflexes that let you get away instantly without having to think about taking off quickness and the slide i use three slides straight in with my feet extended out in front the fadeaway or hook slide and the head first slide thats when you dive into the bag on your belly to be a successful basestealer youve got to know which slide to use in a given situation he continued now ive omitted three important items desire dedication and confidence i rate desire over ability a player with mediocre ability but the great desire to excel can become a star in the major leagues but a player with great ability and no desire wont make it this is what i mean by dedication im always trying to do my job and a little extra i think all ballplayers ought to be dedicated to the game i dont believe in doing just what i have to do and letting it go at that confidence especially when youre trying to steal bases youve got to run with confidence you cannot be afraid to fail the fear of failure will keep you from being a good thief you have to be daring you cant be a safetyfirst runner and steal many bases i said youve always been a pretty good athlete starring as you did in football and basketball and baseball in high school and i would have presumed that this success would have provided you with an ample supply of confidence yet ive heard you say that there were times in the minor leagues when you lost some of your confidence when you thought of quitting wills said baseball is so full of ups and downs and heartaches and i suppose i must have wanted to quit a hundred times figuratively speaking during my years in the minors but as you know i never did my wife and iwe have five children and they have to eat when i felt down i thought about my family and my friends they were pulling for me and they wouldve been terribly disappointed if id turned out to be a quitter when things went roughly i called on my religious faithi think a ballplayer has to have a strong faith in something i was reared in church so i get my strength from religion i tried to understand that when things were going roughly for me god was testing me to see how strong my faith was i felt hurt and disappointed in the spring of when the detroit tigers purchased my contract from the dodgers on a conditional basis and then although i hit well and fielded flawlessly with them during training camp games they turned me back but i didnt get my diaper down i said to myself well im going back home to spokane to play again how could i complain when i was going back home but to tell the whole truth after the tigers turned me down i realized id lost some of my confidence bobby bragan then manager of the spokane team is the man who rebuilt my confidence hes the man most responsible for my being in the major leagues today i asked what did bobby bragan do for you specifically wills said bobby bragan did something for me that no one else had ever done he was like a father to me it wasnt so much that he showed me how to play although he was the man who made me a switchhitterand i dont carry a bigenough stick to make it in the majors without switchhittingbut what was most important to me was the way in which he talked the way he let me know he had confidence in me he told me i had the ability to go all the way to the major leagues i had thought so all along but its hard to fight a battle all alone he rebuilt my confidence as ive indicated after seven years in the minor leagues you sort of lose your confidence and you start concentrating on making a good living in the minors instead of eating your heart out about going to the majors the major key to maury wills resurgence was bragans idea of making him a switchhitterthat was done in that year maury hit only for spokane and stole only bases in games but after the tigers turned him down in he stole bases and hit in the first games of the regular pacific coast league season on the basis of this sensational performance the dodgers considered him for their own club for the first time in the eight and a half seasons he played in their system when wills arrived to join the dodgers he was so unknown that a leading writer asked maury wills whos he for a while wills had a rough time he was tense in the field he couldnt beg borrow or steal a hit eventually though he found himself the dodgers won the national league pennant and during the ensuing world series with the chicago white sox wills outplayed the great luis aparicio i said when you first came to the dodgers in you had a pretty rough time of it you found yourself and sparked the dodgers to a pennant but you werent exactly a star yet walt alston was pinchhitting for you again in how did you hurdle the final obstacle to stardom wills said youre right in what you say you know when i went to spring training camp in i thought i had it made i thought i was the dodger shortstop i thought id finally get to live with the big team at vero beach which was my ambition but i found myself starting all over again i had to win the position all over again well after the regular season began i found myself still coming out of the game in the sixth or seventh inning for a pinchhitter one day alston took me out for a pinchhitter in the third inning its embarrassing to be removed from the game for a pinchhitter in the third inning if you cant stay in the lineup any longer than that you dont have any business being in there in the first place i went to pete reiser a dodger coach and asked for help i said previously that bobby bragan was responsible for my being in the majors well pete reiser kept me there he opened my stance shortened my swing and told me to hit to the opposite field per cent of the time we worked on this days i was playing but i was still coming out in the fifth sixth or seventh inning for a pinchhitter but on the thirteenth or fourteenth day i broke loose theres a short sequel to the story i corralled reiser in los angeles and bragan in chicago i told them that maury wills had paid great tribute to them for his success in the major leagues i asked them to give me their versions of the story to tell me just what they had done for him both men neither knowing what the other had said spoke identical words about maury wills each said he did it he did it all hes the hardestworking ballplayer ive ever known i need your love so bad by fletcher dalton ie walker was returning to alabama she was seated mid way in a miserable little coach the only passenger car on the train the was the towns only train taking and bringing an average of twelve or thirteen passengers weekly except for holidays and funerals she tried to look out the window but it was so streaked and grimy that she turned to reading for the last time ever the fourpage article the national magazine had printed when her retirement from the entertainment world had been announced a few months ago leonie walker the great american negro blues singer shocked the western world last week when she announced in no uncertain terms im quitting best known for her rendition of i need your love so bad it began like all the other articles on all the other negroes who had established themselves it described her life as much of it as she had thought fit to tell them before and during her meteoric rise in the blues world it had rambled on and on filling space until it came to the line which now as it had months ago cut her to the quick the amazing thing is said one colleague that despite all her good fortune leonie has managed to retain her spirit of humility there it was thats what the whole article was about thats what it seemed to her all the articles about famous negroes boiled down to sooner or later that spirit of humility was the east coast euphemism for the despised southern that nigger knows how to stay in his place that unnamed but omnipresent white colleague had mouthed and would mouth that obscenity as long as the population ratio remained what it was that was not what bothered her it was the fact that the thing she was going to do now would make that article sound like gospel truth north south east and west it would seem like little eva coming back across the river but she couldnt stop it coming into oak grove the began its usual ritual of jerks starts and reverses before coming to a dead halt in front of the one room double partitioned in the cause of racial purity station she got up tossed the magazine onto the seat opposite pulled her traveling kit down from the rack and made her way down the aisle into the vestibule and out into the dust gravel and heat of alabama sam mrs glenvilles driver had come up the cars right here he said they shook hands glad to have you back leonie that was all it was enough she knew he meant it yes she was returning and gladly after twelve years of pleading for love on the stages of new york paris london after years of entertaining white men and women by singing those songs born of the tortures which they inflicted upon negroes and in turn paid such fabulous prices to hear oh shed packed auditoriums every program was sold out weeks in advance she autographed photographs every other day just to get ahead but she was always alone in her hotel room a funny kind of prostitution thats what it was only this was worse because the commodity was her soul they paid heavily through that pimp her manager then they entered the darkened room waiting she appeared stripped down to her bare soul flung wide her arms and alternately screamed and whispered i need your love so bad when it was over they were gone she never knew their names did not even recognize the faces of those who came more than once to see her only one thing was sure they were always confident assured of a good performance her voicethat bronze and velvet instrument as one critic called itwas her health card she noticed that sam was taking the short cut as the limousine bumped along the dusty road adding yet another layer of film to the sheets and undergarments hanging on clotheslines she reminded herself without feeling of any sort that she had no point of contact with this the black section of town she had never known a father or mother her first memory being that of playing in a wide back yard with white childrenthe yard of the house to which she was headed now shed never had a black mama to nurse to have comb and grease her hair no black papa to cuddle up to and learn the fear of god and the white man from no black brothers and sisters to run barefoot with in the hot sand no leonies heritage was her song the first time she remembered singing it was in the back yard with michael anne and susan now mr michael miss anne and miss susan and them kneeling at her feet to listen in high school she had sung it on a talent program and had swept away the prize it had launched and kept aloft her career a canarys got to sing she was fond of saying he dont know where the song came from he dont care he just keeps singin three things he dont understand his song his color and his cage he cant understand em he cant fight em and he cant lose em without dyin as they passed washington high school she thought not so much of the years she had spent there as of the years that had passed since her graduation shed returned to the glenville household as cook shed never left it of course it was just that the recognition of the difference between the blackhandinwhitehand relationship of the childhood years and the backofwhitehandacrossblackface relationship of the adult years had to be instilled as subtlety as possible this could be accomplished best so the glenvilles had felt in a negro school only somehow their strategy and her learning had failed them shed learned what they had intended she saw fear hope longing distress daily shed heard all the cruel stories as well as the cruel jokes in self defense she found out what could happen what had happened and what was happening and she armed herself like all the rest of the soldiers in her campfor defeat not victory but it didnt turn out like the experts had predicted perhaps the difference was in her marching song i need your love so bad had won out nobody else had sung a blues that day on the talent program yet leonie had won the prize nobody understood it just as nobody had understood in paris london new york shed had to repeat it everywhere they didnt understand it but they wanted to hear it over and over again perhaps they tried in the rehearing to grasp it but it escaped them nobody knew what it meant either to themselves or to her nobody that is but the glenvilles theyd understood it since that moment they knelt around her feet in their back yard to hear her sing it they knew it was more than a blues they knew it was a fundamental wail from somewhere in the blackness that shielded leonies soul they also knew that it was not directed at them or at anybody in particular and in it they recognized their own needs doubts hopes she was singing for them all it was this that made their bond indivisible they were all caught in that well of loneliness and only leonies song could give their feelings adequate expression it drew them together it made the long journey toward the light a little easier what makes these biscuits so good leonie mrs glenville would ask when they were at supper it was probably the only house in oak grove where the cook ate with the family sweat tears and a song was the answer it was always good for a laugh yet they knew the truth of it they had seen her making bread the water from her brow mixing with the water streaking her cheeks and together falling into the dough and they knew the song it was the one they heard on good days and bad it was the one she hummed when they brought to her their troubles it was the one she involuntarily sang aloud when the troubles were mutual it was the same song whether its function were lullaby lowdown blues or a hymn it was hers to give and theirs to share feeling the car change gears au tomatically she glanced out to find that they were in the oval driveway to the house that twelveroom structure which mr michael and his sisters had left long since leaving mrs glenville widowed childless and alone shell be her old self tonight thought leonie with me and the children all back yes and the grandchildren ive never seen she looked over at the newly mowed kentuckybluegrass lawn and realized that there the decision had been made to present her to the fast moving entertainment world twelve years and a half ago at a glenville family reunion on this lawn leonie had sung to the accompaniment of two guitars sams and the yard mans miss susans brotherinlaw from new york an impresario had known a good thing when he heard it and asked them to entrust their cook to his care she was willing just knocked off my feet as she had put it and her career began weil that was all over now the limousine stopped opposite the front door when she got out sam said ive got to go back downtown to pick up a few things nobodys home but the grandkids and theyre out back its all yours leonie she entered the house looking neither to the right or left not so much out of confidence as out of hope that nothing had been significantly altered since she left until she was in the dining room the note was there on the table which had been set for eight mrs glenville had written just family tonight leonie mike and his wife sue and anne and their husbands you and me leonie sighed and in that exultation swept away the memory of the last twelve years dinner was always served at five thirty she had little over an hour she made for the kitchen alone there she surveyed her old domain it was just as it had been twelve long years ago except for a new tiled floor and different curtains everything else seemed untouched the faucet still had a silent intermittent drip with an effort she could see a portion of the playground where the grandchildren were the window above the sink had not been enlarged after all she turned to the closet beside the pantry took down a starched white uniform and laid it across a chair slowly she took off her turquoise dress and hung it up after the uniform was buttoned she took from her purse a faded bandana and slowly wound it round until it covered every trace of hair from neck to forehead the flour milk salt yeast stood beside the big bowl she began to hum rolled up her sleeves and poured in the ingredients her left forearm cradled the bowl against her stomach her right hand grasped the spoon handle and began the revolutions wide at first against the edges of the bowl and then in closer and closer circles the sweat and the tears were already starting the lost pioneers by beryl decker are so few ne t groes living in rural nebraska that it is interesting to find that some did take land in the homestead days in various parts of the state like many of the white homesteaders they were handicapped by lack of capital to carry them through drouth hard times and hard winters those who were lured to cherry county by the acre kinkaids found the land of little use for farming and the homestead acreage far too small for successful ranching an effort was made by the writers project of the wpa to make a record of the negro farmer in nebraska and there are two short accounts of the settlement in cherry county in reeces history of cherry county and in reverend o j burkhardts history of the negro settlement in cherry county near brownlee the wpa writers found that as early as several families came out from omaha to file claims on sec twp range in franklin county these were the homesteads given under the first homestead act signed by president lincoln in the settlers in franklin county planned to make permanent homes on their claims for they laid out a village to be called grant and they named a nearby stream lovely creek their money gave out and they left the county within the year two groups came from tennessee to take land one group settled in hamilton county in the other group went to harlan county in hard times and hard winters discouraged both groups and they returned to tennessee a lasting settlement was made in in dawson county near overton these people were descendants of slaves who had escaped to canada via the underground railway and had evidently done very well there they had the finances to stay on their homesteads until they could get a crop and to make the necessary improvements on their land to get the patents after the residence stipulation had been met in eight of these families disposed of their dawson county holdings and led the way to cherry county they crossed the platte river and trailed through the sandhills in covered wagons to ten miles north west of brownlee to file claims to acre homesteads roy brown of valentine nebraska thinks that his father george brown took the first homestead in the area on sec twp range in he was soon followed by dawson county neighbors william walker albert riley george riley c h mehan joshua emanuels j a hatters and william crawford they staked out their claims built their soddies and settled down to living in a wilderness with few roads few fences few trees and hills with much less grass on them than is there now seth hanna long time rancher in cherry county thinks that the first claim was made by a negro railroader clem deaver deaver may have heard of this large tract of unclaimed land when he was in seneca a booming railroad town at that time seth thinks that deaver may have alerted other negroes to the opportunity in land for they soon came from other nebraska towns lincoln schuyler alliance north platte and broken bow they came from other states ohio indiana kansas and missouri roy brown says that at one time there were over a hundred families in the colony it is stated in the reece history of cherry county that by homesteads had been taken by negroes this was more than acres of land beginning miles northwest of brownlee it lay for miles on either side of the north loup river some of it was the best land in the county on the other hand joshua emanuels land was such a blowout that they dubbed it emanuels desert they named their sod post office dewitty after the first postmaster mail was brought in daily from seneca they added a store building to their post office ed white who has run a store at brownlee for many years says that they used to purchase merchandise from his store to sell from the dewitty store school districts and were organized in an area where there were no white settlers later another district was organized for both white and negro children goldie and fern walker became school teachers goldie who became mrs w r hayes taught in the rural schools of cherry county and south dakota all of her life her last teaching was in she was an excellent teacher her schoolrooms were very very clean and had carpets on the floors and white curtains and the best of all equipment that she could persuade school boards to purchase she put on many fine musical programs with her pupils after she moved to valentine in she was a member of the m e church choir for many years before her death in the rev mr o j burkhardt a missionary evangelist of the african methodist episcopal church visited the colony and helped them organize a church they built it across the river about a mile from their post office it was made up of many denominations who forgot their differences and worked together for the common good their first pastor the rev mr w h mance from topeka took a homestead where the parsonage was built he remained long enough to get a patent for his claim the next pastor the rev mr william kerby from kansas city also took a claim and proved up on it before he left the settlers from dawson county were used to farming and continued to farm in cherry county they knew little of crop rotation and other means of crop improvement roy brown says they corned it to death with a little more capital and knowhow of stock raising some of them could have developed successful ranches the rileys stuck it out until when albert sold out and moved to valentine to work for the niobrara wild life reserve he remained at this work for twenty years when he retired and moved to danver his son albert of valentine says that the hard times of the s forced his father to give up his land cows were bringing and corn cents a bushel they couldnt make a living at those prices some very able mechanics such as carpenters and masons were among the negro colony both men and women worked wherever they could get it from other ranchers to add to the income they could get from their land eddie ford walked seven miles night and morning to and from a ranch job robert hannahs rode his horse to brownlee every friday to open his barber shop by sunday evening he had taken care of his customers at brownlee and the surrounding countryside and rode back to his home several men are still living in the area who were barbered by hannahs and some remember going as children to his home for their haircuts old settlers who lived in the county at the time of the negro settlement speak of them as good citizens good workers good musicians and good baseball players they brought color and gaiety to the usual drabness of pioneer life there was music for all occasionsdances fairs fourth of july celebrations and the threeday rodeo at brownlee when the negroes were there the price brothers made up one orchestra and there were other groups of players their instrumentation was violin guitar mandolin and piano boss woodson was a fine singer as well as a mandolin player it sounded like an organ when mr and mrs c spees sang together in the congregational church at thedford old settlers say it was an entertainment treat for them to go to the negro dances to watch their beautiful dancing when they got together for a dance in the town hall roy brown says that most of them played by ear they would get a phonograph record and listen to it over and over until they could play it a few could play it after one hearing teams from thedford and brownlee played their baseball team the negroes not only played ball but entertained the spectators all the while with clowning along with their playing four young men from the colony served the country in world war i w r hayes joseph boyd mckinley boyd and glen hannahs all returned to their homes but boyd had spent so much time in wet trenches that he never fully recovered his health a few of these settlers lived on their land for a quarter of a century others relinquished their rights for what they could get as soon as they were able they didnt like rural life or couldnt make a living there others held on to get the patents to the land and then sold out others mortgaged the land and lost through not being able to meet interest payments the cattlemen who bought the land had come to the sandhills in the days of the free range and had learned what could be done with those hills while riding for other outfits they had learned that it wasnt farm land and that it takes thousands of acres to make a ranch they usually had a little capital and a few cattle when they took their kinkaids they picked up other land as they were able until they had a ranch sothe corned to death land has gone back to prairie sod the soddies have been destroyed by wind cattle and moisture such frame buildings as there were have been hauled away by the new owners most of the negroes have gone to the cities omaha denver kansas city st louis or to the west coast all that remains is the cemeteryprobably a dozen unmarked graves in one of seth hannahs pastures some are buried at brownlee and memories remain for the old settlers of a good people gay and lighthearted in trying circumstancesand memories for the negroes of the great good times they had down there that roy brown speaks of the untold story of open housing in suburbia by bill boone park forest a middleclass suburb of chicago the james robinson family moved quietly and almost uneventfully into their newlybought home integrating what was formerly an allwhite community the only incident which the robinsons and park forest residents now recall with humor was an almost bazaar enactment of a scene from a silent movie a day before the robinsons moved in unknown but suspected youthful pranksters painted their wooden fence black the following day police and other residents appeared with buckets and brushes in hand apologized to the robinsons and repainted the fence white in hastings ranch an upperclass suburb of los angeles mr and mrs albert morris a retired professional couple have lived peacefully in their pleasant surroundings since august we have made delightful friends and we like the area says mrs morris there was some opposition shortly after the morrises moved in almost persons met to block the first negro familys move into the allwhite suburb the course of action chosen by the majority was to accept the single occurrence but to socially reject the morrises and work to keep other negro families out dissenting from the majority were two individuals members of a fair housing group who thought differently and went to work to change attitudes shortly afterwards a second meeting was called under the new auspices and persons attended to welcome the morrises to hastings ranch in boston air force captain and mrs g b tracy and family were desirous of moving to the suburbs for the usual reasons better schools fresh air back yard barbecues etc after locating a house through the clearing house office maintained by the fair housing federation of greater boston they drove out to talk with the owner who felt obligated to consult his neighbors before selling after sampling the opinions of neighbors which were about equal in regard to accepting a negro family as neighborsthe owner decided to sell assured by the owner and the suburbs fair housing committee that although there may be some stresses and strain there would be no violent reactions the tracys moved in there were no serious problems their two children went to local schools and have encountered no discrimination some neighbors have ignored the tracys but most were friendly and welcoming and as predicted by members of the fair housing committee several of the neighbors who were opposed to the tracys buying have now become good friends in levittown new jersey more than families have integrated that suburban area without incident peaceful integration of hundreds of negro families in suburban boston philadelphia and washington have occurred with scant notice from the press the examples go on and on in suburbs villages and townships hundreds of negro families have yielded to suburbia fever and have fled the overcrowded ghetto areas for the same reasons as their white counterparts over the past five years the incidence of peaceful and harmonious integration of previously allwhite areas has been occurring with increasing frequency in practically all areas in the united states above the mason dixon line how has this receptive atmosphere come about through what avenues or agencies may a negro buyer find housing in the suburbs why have there been little or no publicity about the peaceful moveins are enough negroes taking advantage of this open door policy the answer to the last question is not nearly enough according to the reports of many whites and nonwhites working for open occupancy in suburbia in fact many feel the negro is still too reluctant still too fearful of making the move even though studies and polls point out that the negro wants and needs better housing and the advantages suburban living offers many persons most of whom are whites working for residential integration go so far as to say it is the negros duty to move into the areas now made or being made available to him that he should take advantage of this opportunity after he and so many others have fought for open occupancy and other white members of such housing groups who have tired of seeking and trying to persuade negro families to move to the suburbs throw up their hands in frustration and despair and withdraw their efforts with the attitude if they dont want to come well what is all this talk about discrimination and racism but to answer the above questions in order the receptive atmosphere in hundreds of suburban areas is being created by the increasing number of fair housing groups springing up all over the united states they may be called fair housing committees human relations councils friends suburban housing home home opportunities made equal or by various other names they may be a part of or cooperate with existing human relations groupspublic and privatewhich are working in the housing field but the general purpose of all of them is to make possible for every man the equal opportunity to obtain housing without regard to race religion or national origin but as pointed out in trends in housing a publication of the national committee against discrimination in housing an organization of associated groups who have successfully fought on the national level for equal housing the various fair housing groups concern goes beyond the effort to guarantee the right of minorities to move freely into any neighborhood they desire and can afford they actively promote residential integrationwhether a fair housing practices law applies to their community or not they are committed to the proposition that integrated communities are socially healthy politically desirable and economically sound if they live in an allwhite community they want it to become integrated if they live in an integrated community they want to keep it that way these grassroots organizations are interested in general improvement of housing conditions but they are not trying to meet housing needs per se and since their purpose is to maintain residential in tegration they may search for the white as well as the nonwhite homeseeker as a result they fight to combat unethical real estate agents since such tactics almost always create other segregated areas many of these organizations limited their activities almost exclusively to opening up housing for negroes in the suburbs since it is believed that the suburb is where the solution to the housing problem lies too violence most often occurs in fringe areas just two to three blocks from a negro ghetto where blockbusters used in the derogatory sense have incited suspicion and fear within the white areas near the ghetto credit for the present breakthrough in the suburbs as well as in certain allwhite areas in cities must also go to the presence of fair housing laws on various states statutes and to such organizations as the above mentioned ncdh which since has played a central role in the movement toward equal opportunity in housing according to margaret fisher editor of trends in housing its constituents include the principal religious civic labor and civil_rights groups which are dedicated to the proposition that equal opportunity to bargain in an open competitive market for shelter is a basic constitutional and moral right of every american another organization religiously oriented and which has pioneered in equal housing opportunity and in helping to create a receptive atmosphere for nonwhites in allwhite areas is the american friends service committees housing opportunity program a committee of the friends community relations program the housing arm has worked for several years toward the basic goal of expanding areas for nonsegregated living by working with members of the housing industry and with concerned citizens and organizations but the most recent acts that have given a moral as well as a legal impetus to open occupancy was president kennedys long awaited stroke of the pen and federal housing administrator robert c weavers directive that prohibits discrimination in the sale or rental of fha and va financed housing although activities of the local fair housing groups may vary somewhat their pattern of operation is usually the same the decision is somehow made by several people or groups in the allwhite community to work toward integrated housing on at least one occasion trend reports the motivation came from a welladministered shock by a fouryearold a suburban housewife and her young son met an elegant and distinguished negro woman at the home of a friend mommie queried the fouryearold whose maid is that that night a group of friends met at the womans home to talk about what white suburbia was doing to our children and what we could do about it a fair housing committee was organized on the spot after such a group is formed a query in the form of an open occupancy petition or fair housing pledge is circulated in the community from the petitions can be determined the feeling of the community and therefore how much work must be done to create a receptive mood or atmosphere it must be noted that the petition is not circulated as a poll since the individual members know that the right of an individual to buy a house cannot depend on a vote of the neighbors too experience of the groups prove that whites refuse to sign the petition or pledge or indicates he is opposed to nonwhites as neighbors is likely to change his position after meeting the newcomers since no subterfuge is used in selling to nonwhites homes are shown to prospective customers in broad daylight no quota system is set although friends suburban housing one of the only such groups that actually is a licensed real estate firm limits the number of houses to minority group families in one neighborhood for fear of further segregation within the suburb in addition to maintaining listings for available housing the fair housing groups sponsor rumor clinics workshops on the housing problem or intergroup relations organize forums or speakers bureaus to combat the popular misconceptions about the negro and property values usually backed by or working in conjunction with the church or other civic organizations the various councils also prevail upon village officials and law enforcement agencies to cooperate with them and to assist them whenever necessary and although law enforcement officers in the example of park forest might have gone beyond the call of duty other communities have reported full cooperation by police in protecting the rights of all citizens and some law enforcement offices in several communities like park forest and skokie illinois announced these intentions publicly in addition to actively seeking out negro families interested in moving to a suburban community the councils also supply white checkers for nonwhite applicants who are running into difficulty securing accommodations and in many cases locate cooperative real estate agencies for the prospective buyers outside of the aforementioned friends suburban housing which was also organized for the purpose of promoting residential integration fsh has sold homes mostly in allwhite areas to negroes in the philadelphia suburban communities the councils are predominantly nonprofit and manned by volunteers the listing services are free and are maintained for the purpose of facilitating direct communication between the home seeker and the owner or landlord this also serves to bypass the restrictions imposed by discriminatory real estate practices what must be added is the fact that the fair housing councils do not attempt to force a seller to sell or a negro to buy the aim of these groups is to meet the need and desires of the homeseeker with appropriate available housing and adds arthur smith of levittown n j cochairman of the burlington county human relations council and a negro we are much interested in having this integrated housing come about in the right way as we are in just having this come about this means no blockbusting techniques no scare selling no panic and no violence why has there been little publicity on peaceful moveins as one member of a fair housing council stated just as one often reads news of divorce but rarely of happy marriages so one frequently hears of hostility and violence when a negro family moves into a previously allwhite neighborhood but rarely learns of peaceful and harmonious integration little publicity on the successful moveins can also be attributed to the policy of the various councils which regard the purchase or sale of a home a private and personal decision secondly the process of creating a receptive atmosphere or attitude of acceptance in a community requires thoughtful frank discussion by concerned individuals both of which may be made more difficult if not impossible by publicity or published statements by the more radical elements in a community perhaps partly decause of this unpublicized progressas well as many other reasonsthere is in many communities more available housing than nonwhite families to fill them according to ncdh why is this so especially since negroes have been knocking on the housing barrier and with greater force in the past few years why do they not take advantage of the open door to the suburbs or is open occupancy in housing only an issue for airing grievances against whites and not to be taken advantage of when the openings come the reasonssome might call them argumentsare valid say many negroes who have addressed themselves to the question first of all there is fear a very real and valid fear of moving into the suburbs away from people of the same racial background and experience negroes homes have been bombed or vandalized and the newcomers harassed although this has happened only relatively few times in suburban areas but as stated earlier such acts of violence and hate usually are publicized more and are remembered more readily than the numerous peaceful incidents secondly there are those for whom the suburbs hold no fascination to them the better school yard space and fresh air is no compensation for the cost and trouble of commuting back and forth to work negro families falling into this group perhaps should not be mentioned but they are to be distinguished from those who vocally share these same sentiments but later move into an allnegro suburb sometimes farther away than comparable white suburbs perhaps the thought of leaving relatives friends and people of similar interests and experiences is the most oftenheard reasons why negro families remain unattracted to suburban living this reason of course erroneously implies that there will be no families in the suburbs with similar interests background and experiences the fact is according to the case history of negro families who have moved to the suburbs their background interests and professions were more similar to those in their new community outside of different racial experiences other factors were quite surprisingly similar what about schooling will the negro child be discriminated against or hurt through being the only nonwhite in the classroom or school how will his being a minority affect him psychologically from the experiences of several negro parents with children of school age the record shows the youngsters are readily accepted by both teachers and pupils in at least one case a suburban mother said her children were treated almost like celebrities by other students and teachers and that her only fear was the effects of the abundance of attention her children were receiving the psychological effects of being a minority in a school are perhaps longreaching subtle and difficult to assess and may depend on the parents attitude and teachings in the home in regard to racial matters and human values but the opportunity for varied racial experiences it must be recalled have been among the motivations behind many of the fair housing councils efforts to integrate their community is it unlikely to assume that such interracial experience will also benefit the negro child responding perhaps defensively perhaps with resentment to such urgings to move to suburbia other negroes say we lived together in the city and you fled from me why do you want me to live with you now the same question has been put another way why do whites consider a school that is per cent negro as intolerable so they move away and one that is per cent white as integrated perhaps no better person could answer that question than harry teshima of park forest a japaneseamerican whose wife and children are longtime residents of the area says teshima who was instrumental in getting the first negro family into park forest i refuse to take the blame for those people you may be speaking about for not all people in the suburbs fled from negroes many moved out of their former neighborhoods to the suburbs for the same reason i believe negroes want to move out of the enforced ghettoes many negroes ive talked to say they dont necessarily want integration but equality of opportunity in america how can you have equality of opportunity and not have integration still another factor in the negros fear of the suburbs is the misconception about suburban living according to the experiences of some fair housing council members many negroes believe housing is cheaper and taxes are lower this is not always true in addition commuting if one works in the city is an inevitable fact that usually frightens a citydweller considering moving to suburbia then there are rumors usually false rumors that discourage potential home buyers what advice would you give to families who are thinking about moving to the suburbs a newlyarrived negro suburban housewife was asked dont listen to relatives and friends she said the rumors mostly unfounded and distorted were related to her after she had talked to friends about her familys planned move to a particular suburb her fears on moving into the new home were multiplied she said and every car every strange sound chilled her later she found the rumors to be either false or completely distorted the responsibilities and tasks voluntarily assumed by members of these local fair housing councils are difficult and at times disappointing its members have discovered but as indicated by the growing number of fair housing councils and the hundreds of successful moveins in many areas the efforts being made are not futile the successful examples prove that the door to the suburb is open to negro houseseekers and that there are hundreds of fairminded conscientious americans who are helping to hold it ajar introducing the concept by william barrow birth of a new theater is an event usually as sad hopeful sad in most cases to a brief lifetime as it is because it is predoomed outside of new york city professional or semiprofessional little theater has seldom survived more than a few seasons in this country there have been some exceptions and a notable one is clevelands karamu house and that is where the hopefulness comes in with each new start of a local theater there is hope that it will find anchor grow and become what those who delivered it into life envision for it in detroit a city with a long history of little theater starts another enfant little theater is alive and kicking it is called the concept or concepteast and there is reason to harbor hopes for its future the concepts founder and director is woodie king jr a multitalented young man who believes thatthrough artit is possible to begin the allimportant task of changing america of helping the nation to realize its limitless potential he is an actor having appeared in a raisin in the sun the death of bessie smith and several other productions and he is a writer his short story beautiful light and black our dreams will appear in the june issue of negro digest the concept is a nonracial theater meaningin this case that it will be consciously concerned with ignoring the usual restrictions of race and color to this end the theaters first production was study in color a series of three oneact plays by the rev mr malcolm boyd the episcopal chaplain at wayne state university and an energetic detractor of racists in study in color the actorsone negro and one whitechange their colors by way of masks and turn the racial tables the play was selected for publication in best plays of dodd mead co detroit is experiencing something of a cultural nascence see negro digest november and the concept promises to serve as showcase for the work of local dramatists the theaters announcement of plays for the season includes work by king ann coleman hershel steinhart and ronald milner it also promises a dance program by jimi hunt exdunham dancer and an experimental project by lee ivory called spoofs in spades the most ambitious undertaking schedule for the concept is a production of frenchman jean genets the blacks an extraordinarily sophisticated and difficult play which has been enjoying an offbroadway success for two years directoractor king has the support of some of the citys most experienced theater people including david rambeau gil maddox phil purcell dick smith beldon raspberry sylvia king dick marsh ronald milner cliff frazier and elaine jackson he also has the assistance of an advisory board that includes influential citizens among them are the rev mr boyd dr broadus n butler see the article the time is now on page congressman and mrs charles diggs jr dr charles wright mrs celia turner dr lionel swan charles ellington and mrs mozell goins the concept itself is located in a small renovated section of a building on the edge of the downtown loop and has a seating capacity of its walls are hung with paintings by local artists most of them for sale the close cooperation among artists writers and actors in the city is reflected in the concept director king is interested in seeing new plays and budding playwrights can contact him in detroit at the concept east adams those plays which are performed or which become a part of the theaters repertory will receive a perperformance royalty for their authors he indicated as is generally true with new theaters and new theater groups the concept is the offspring of several other groups collaborations and ideas kings first association with father boyd was in an experimental theater called the unstabled the priest wrote a sketch called boy an experience in the search for identity in which he played the part of a negro and king portrayed a white man the production was the forerunner of study in color in recent years detroit has delivered unto the national scene a number of first rate artists including painter hughie leesmith directoractor lloyd richards and metropolitan opera tenor george shirley and there is hope in the city that the cultural nascence will produce other extraordinary artists hopes are riding on the concept to achieve this success in the realm of the theater home to africa by saunders redding he story is told that aii when that flinty old ii scholar writer and world traveler dr w kjr landed in ghana in at the invitation of president kwame nkrumah he lowered himself to his knees and kissed the mother earth of africa the story is probably apocryphal it is hard to imagine dubois doing anything so contrary to the character he has given himselfand the world has acceptedfor threequarters of a century but when i raised the objection the british highechelon civil servant who was returning to his post in africa after home leave and who claimed to have witnessed this act of obeisance replied ah but africa does some strange things to you people although i instinctively resented what struck me as condescendence in the phrase you people i did not dispute the assertion i had heard other incredible stories of the transforming power of africa including some about going native and taking to the bush but as our plane banked into the approach pattern over dakar senegal all i really know was that my curiosity about africa was excited almost beyond tolerable measure it had been excited before by other places and many people and i hope it will be excited again but this time it was different africa had been a vague troubling presence in my imagination for nearly as long as i can remember like most americans of my generation i had had the wrong learning about africa and like most negro americans had never felt any pride in what i had been uncritically taught to believe indeed the oppositewhich i think was probably intended i was ashamed that africans were rated the lowest of the human species that once captured and sold into bondage often by other africans they took happily to slavery as if it was their natural condition that they lived in mud huts went naked and ate human flesh and that africa was the white mans graveyard so wasnt i glad that my ancestors had been brought from that benighted landthat dark continentand i could enjoy the blessings of civilization i could not then say forty years ago but i could now counter that question with another what blessings dakar was a refueling stop and as we walked toward the dimlit in transit lounge i turned to my wife arent you going to kiss the ground i said at three oclock in the morning a cool breeze was blowing off the ocean we were moving with a sluggish stream of people mostly white and the language we heard was french besides my wife said looking around what makes you think were in africa well its a state of mind i said we were joking of course but both of us were right nothing made me think of africa until at twothirty in the afternoon we reached lagos nigeria at our stop in accra which is the capital of the most african of black african countries the sense of africa i might have had was diluted by the presence of more britishers than blacks at the airport they were what is frequently pictured as the ubiquitous colonialtype britisherstarched khaki shorts pyramids of service ribbons pinned to the breasts of shortsleeved belted tunics ruddy cheeks mustaches slateblue eyes blond wives and blond children tugging and yapping at darkskinned nannies the scene at the airport brought back sharp memories of poona nagpur and jubbulpore the sun dazzling on the low louvered cement buildings the heat the red dust powdering the foliage and rising in great funnelclouds in the wind of prop washall of it might have been in the central plain of india in the dry season in the best days of the british raj but blackskinned hostesses met the plane at lagos with a minimum of fuss black officials ushered us through customs and policemen almost the color of their dark blue woolen shirts waved our car into the swollen tide of traffic moving cityward because our skins were pale to theirs we were not negroes nor for all the proof of passports american europeans they called us with the accent on the second syllable and at dinner that night at the mainland hotel it did not occur to the waiter to offer us the african menu we ate europeanpotage du jour brussels sprouts irish potatoes english mutton danish pastry nevertheless we were in africa all right and specifically in the capital of the largest independent country south of the sahara the african summit meeting was about to take place there and almost the first african i met on his home groundsa civil engineer with the hybrid name of james wellington ogu educated at rugby and cambridgenoting that africans had taken over the european hotels at least for the duration of the meeting remarked that the whites had all but fled from this new manifestation of the black mans concert and his will to power i think perhaps mr ogu overstated it the hottest most humid weather had come it was a good time for short leaves and the inviting mountain heights of jos were only a few hours away so what one saw everywhere were proud black faces gleaming atop billowing rich robes over the collar insignia of smart uniforms and above the tidy knots of ties tailored in bond street what one heard were yoruba ibo hausa swahili and oneself addressedfrench and english the native markets swarmed spotting europeans a block away slicksters sidled up to offer ivory beads swiss watches german cameras the main streets were gay with bunting and often shrill with the piping of uniformed school children marching four abreast to the rhythms of their own pure voices along the marina the flagdraped portraits of the heads of state of the monrovia powers looked sternly down on guards of honor shining official cars and soldiers frozen at the gates of government compounds and at stations every fifty feet along the palmlined thoroughfare the summit meeting which was convoked with restrained enthusiasm and great dignity by sir abubakar tafawa balewa prime minister of nigeria did not resolve any of those problems that african leaders themselves call pressing it did not level tariff barriers or standardize african railroads or decide on an intraafrica monetary system to certain biased unofficial observers including afrikaners portuguese and a clutch of sir roy welenskys bluster boys it proved only that africa is nationsand increasingly more of them to such observers africa is nations inevitably and naturally divided by ethnic groupings by language and culture by territorial boundaries and by sociopolitical alignments with various parts of the nonafrican world it is true of course that africa is caucasoid and negroid hamitic and semitic it is coptic priest and pagan priestess moslem christian hindu and animist it is portuguese exclave the french community the british commonwealth and the still undissolved central african federation in short africa would appear to be an irresoluble clash and confusion of native and foreign values and the inherited prejudices of nearly all the nations of europe and one who looked to the summit meeting for proof of this might have thought he found it in the declination of the casablanca group ghana guinea mali egypt and algeria to attend and mr nkrumahs denunciation of the monrovia powers but he would have been deceived i think for the one thing the summit meeting seemed to make clear is that in spite of diversity and all the appearances of fragmentation africa is nations committed and bound in spiritual congregation to the idea of panafrica it is not quite the old idea for with the emergence of the independent arab states north of the sahara it has taken on new political dimensions as a political idea it had not been conceived twentyfive years ago and what it means to bourguiba king hassan and ben bella is something quite different from what it meant then as a political idea panafrica faces problems that europe has failed to solve in all the years of onagain offagain effort since napoleon it envisions nothing less than what has been variously called a united states of africa a concert of africa and a parliament of africa in deference to this the new constitution for morocco overwhelmingly approved just recently plays down arab unity and declares that morocco will have among its prime objectives the realization of african unity surely too ethiopias and tunisias membership in the monrovia group of states which are all but solid black and moroccos and algerias membership in the casablanca groupalso all but solid blackhave the same objective and meaningthat is the political union of the african continent but the evidence available to an american negro visitor to subsahara africa suggests that this may be the least of the meanings in that region where the concept of panafrica is deeply involved with the idea of racethe black race it is an emotional involvement that confuses recent history and confounds political thought one cannot avoid the feeling of unhappy ambivalence that is provoked when in the same speech dr nnamdi azikiwe governorgeneral of nigeria says take the individual prophets of panafricanism and it will be found that in all cases they are ethnocentric in their ideas and concepts of panafricanism when edward wilmot blyden preached the projection of the african personality he had at the back of his mind the black inhabitants of africa the same may be said of burghardt dubois of america mojola agbebi of nigeria jomo kenyatta of kenya javabu of south africa kwame nkrumah of ghana and leopold senghor of senegal that and then this my considered views are that panafricanism has come to stay and it will yet be a shining example to the rest of the world how people of different races divergent cultures and diversity of languages can live together in political unity in one continent not being a seer i can only prophesy that panafricanism is destined to be feasible destined to be feasible whether a bright hope or a desperate who can say and who can saym whether the apparent race bias of president nkrumahs struggle for black africas regenerationpolitically socially economically within the milieu suited to the communal pattern of african society which is the foundation of panafricanism is corrected by the casablanca group which nkrumah himself called into being there is little to wonder at but much to understand that out of an overwhelming emotional need unsatisfied for half a millenium offices of africanization are set up and staffed ethnic symbols and myths are ever more viable western cultural authority courageously challenged and the prestige of whiteness diminished everywhere in black africa as an old idea the association that clung to panafrica were ethnic and as dr azikiwes speech made clear its prophets were ethnocentric if it meantas it certainly didafrica for black africans it also meant hope in black africas future and a resurrectionno a new birthof pride in its past as an old idea panafrica had been made respectable to me by my experience as a negro in america long before african intellectuals of the stature of leopold senghor and alioune diop elaborated it and the west indian poet aime cesaire refined out of it the mystique negritude and nkrumah gave it fresh utterance at the allafrican peoples conference in and long long before elijah poole the american negro who now calls himself elijah muhammad screamed it as a battle cry for mindless violenttongued revolutionaries to echo and gather to panafrica was an assertion of the common cultural heritage of all black menwhich as i saw it certainly included me since a cultural history is proclaimed everywhere to be the unassailable testimonial to the dignity and worth of a people and since by definition i was excluded from the cultural heritage that should have been mine by right of birth panafrica was the door through which fulfillment gleamed yet so frustrating and divisive was the learning of my youth and so charismatic the projection of the american dream when that door was opened at the allafrican writers conference in uganda last spring i could not enter through it of the black african writers most likely to be known to the west only leopold senghor peter abrahams and the ailing and aging amos tutuola were missing chinua achebe ezekiel mphahlele gabriel okara wole soyinka amadou samb bloke modisane thirtytwo in all representing the finest writing talent in africa were there there were four americans and of the several british at least four were publishers or publishers representatives including the poet langston hughes who is negro and the novelist robie macauley who is the editor of the kenyon review we americans were guests and our participation in the conference was appropriately lowkeyed the british had a somewhat different status difficult to explain but supported by the fact that they were there on business they were scouting the conference for publishable manuscripts and they were prepared to announce that a group of publishersbritish and americanwould sponsor a competition for the best novel by a black african on an african theme knowledge of this however was a wellkept secret it was to be the piece de resistance of the cultural feast to come as a surprise in next to the last plenary session having been let in on it in strict confidence i had three or four days in tingling expectation of a joyous reaction almost as if the competition was a project devised of my own thoughtful generosity many of the sessions had been taken up with questionsmore complex and more passionately discussed than i make them seem nowof the african writers audience which is limited and the cold indifference of the nonafrican world to africas literary aspirations the announcement i thought happily would be satisfaction of a real complaint i rather expected a spontaneous cheer but i was mistaken in supposing that the silence that followed was the speechlessness of ecstasy the dark sensitive intelligent faces over which i had watched animation play for nearly a week were immobile and impassive the silence was a challenge to a code i had learned so thoroughly that i had ceased to think of it i did not know the depth and substance of my african friends pride i had been taught that at the very least one should look thankful for even gestures of small favors from an all too casual and perfunctory white world i looked toward langston hughes but he was far down the table and opposite me robie macauleys head was lowered and i could not see his face plainly though the publishers were puzzled and i guessed hurt by this indifference to their charitable intentions it was not quite indifference someone asked a question when did the competition open close there were other questionsneutral routine products of politeness gradually however i could sense a subterranean flow of thought and feeling i could not guess then who will judge this competition the answer was that since they the publishers were primarily interested in a nonafrican audience the judges would be nonafrican suddenly all the writers were talking at once i will not try to relate all that was said for indeed i cannot but the gist was this it is all very well for european publishers to establish a rich prize for us africans to compete for and we thank thembut what are these publishers expectations essentially nonafrican perhaps they do not understand the insidiousness of this our standards reflecting our own values and ideals are different from theirs and until they accept our standards we can have no pride in our accomplishments as africans and no hope that the dignity of black men is recognized although colonial despotism has forced us to use their language our standards of expressiveness are different from theirs our imaginations work differently from theirs and are not inspired by the same realities they make certain assumptions about experience that we do not make nor ever will make they would have us disregard the new political sanctions that have come with independence and that encourage black artists and writers to be creative according to the standards and tastes of our own people will competing for this prize assure our cultural rebirth indeed will it not have the opposite effect and if this is not a hazard who are the europeans to judge us by our own standards and expectations if it is their mind to favor us then let it be on our own terms let them know that african nationalism the african personality and negritude are adequate to inspire black writers and artists with themes and to creative works justified by the authority of a black audience let us define our own genius stated with a blunt eloquence of passion that i have completely failed to convey this was the argument this was panafrica both in spirit and in word there was no discourtesy in itno fleer of sarcasm no intentional sharp anger of reproof it was simply triumphant and it moved its darkskinned audience to triumphant cries of hear hear and to surges of spontaneous applause that were not meant to be a reproach to an american negro guests pallid conception of his negroness i felt small gutted wretched i was locked out of the brotherhood of blacks by the terms used to define the black brotherhood confronted by this palpable african presence i was neither american nor black i was no one america had not made me real in the sense that africa had made real the men my elbows touched on either side they were substance i was shadow the african personality and negritude were no longer a myth compounded by a mystique again my eyes stole toward langston hughes but i still could not see his face across from me robie macauley looked withdrawn and remote from the american scholar jazz at the by leonard feather n philadelphia a i d few months ago jazz singer dakota staton filed suit in a federal sewh district court against the leader of the black muslim cult she claimed that a new york disc jockey had denounced her a new jersey nightclub proprietor had refused to book her because he feared he would be boycotted and various other misadventures had befallen her because many associated her with the cults advocacy of negro nationalism this was happening miss staton declared because the public was confusing the black muslims with the orthodox moslem faith of which she and her husband are devout advocates in clarksdale mississippi according to a recent issue of jet the most popular recording on the juke box at aaron henrys fourth street drugstore was a white mans heaven is a black mans hell the tune written by two black muslims was getting more plays than records by ray charles in los angeles new york and wherever he has appeared for the past few years dizzy gillespie has regaled audiences with anecdotes before each tune stories about mississippi the john birch society his own overseas tours we wrote this next one on our recent trip to africa where we were busy making apologies for the state department and a mock admonition to his white listeners you better be ready cause were fixin to take over the world these reflections of contemporary american society focus attention on two central facts that the american public black and white alike is more raceconscious than at any time since the civil war and that the american negro fed up with a hundred years of being told lets not be hasty is finding common cause with the nonwhite people who make up a majority of the worlds population the new militancy of the negro has naturally found its way to jazz and by an ironic turn is making itself felt in a reversal of the prevailing roles of white and negro in our country in socalled crow jim an antiwhite racial barrier on the occasion of the gifted white saxophonist brew moores departure for europe because he could not find work in or around the san francisco area jazz columnist ralph gleason wrote racial lines are now drawn much more strongly than ever before in jazz clubs are reluctant to hire any white groups except the top few eastern record companies specializing in jazz record almost no white musicians at all these days and have in several instances turned down nationally known jazz figures for recording dates because they were the wrong color hand in hand with this goes the claim by some musicians that jazz is the progeny of the negro race and is totally alien to the white man in stockholm a famed and respected american negro jazz musician told reporter bjorn fremer the negro has a long inherited tradition in jazz its his music white people have no right to play it its a colored folk music white society has its own tradition like the polka this is the kind of music that it should concentrate on the negros ascendancy in jazz if put in less extreme terms would seem indisputable yet there are pervasive and persistent contradictions how when and where white musicians became involved in jazz and the degree to which they made an original contribution to the form cannot be determined at this historical distance years elapsed before students became sufficiently concerned with the birth of jazz to do substantial research and by this time most of the witnesses of the early innovators were dead senile or totally unreliable contradicting each other according to personal prejudices curiously enough none other than louis armstrong points to a white origin for jazz in an autobiography called swing that music he wrote four years before i learned to play the trumpet the first great jazz orchestra was formed in new orleans by a cornet player named dominic la rocca his orchestra had only five pieces but they were the hottest five pieces that had ever been known before la rocca named this band the old dixieland jazz band actually the original dixieland jazz band the band has gone down in musical history la roccas fame as one of the great pioneers of syncopated music will last a long long time as long i think as american music lives in contrast a white jazz historian marshall stearns devotes three chapters of his book the story of jazz to its musical roots in africa and the west indies he asserts that around the turn of the century more than a decade before the events mentioned by armstrong playing jazz was integrated with the everyday life of the negro community that the contribution of the negro gave minstrelsy its vitality and that minstrelsy and ragtime collided in the s the former serving as a training ground for early jazzmen nick la rocca himself provides a good example of the oldtimer with a personal bias before he died a few years ago he worked closely with the author of a book called the story of the original dixieland jazz band la rocca virulently resented negro successes in jazz and as a consequence there is scarcely any mention of negro musicians in this book if one relied solely on the evidence of the book it would appear that jazz was a fairhaired baby indeed yet stearns suggests that white players only imitated the negro musicians of the time reporting that around in new orleans at the ranch cabaret according to a negro musician who worked there the white kids who later became famous as the original dixieland jazz band used to hang around and listen openmouthed to the music nat hentoff in a survey of race prejudice in jazz for harpers recalled that the new orleans negro trumpeter freddie keppard turned down an offer to record for rca victor in fearing that records would make his music easier to steal it was therefore only because of keppards reluctance that the white original dixieland jazz band happened to be the first to make records a year later on the other hand stearns says of ragtime originally a form of guitar and piano music that later merged into dixieland that it began in the midwest rather than new orleans and goes on to say that there were firstclass white as well as negro composers and performers history having thus passed into limbo undocumented and largely unobserved we can be certain now only that such prejazz forms as ragtime folkblues and minstrelsy sprang up in a firmly segregated society in my own book investigating jazz origins the book of jazz i observed that it was the segregated american negro not the negro who contributed most of its essential characteristics jazz was the product of a specific social environment in which a group of people the american negroes largely shut off from the white world developed cultural patterns of their own but if the bent note the plaintive flatted thirds and sevenths of the blues scale were drawn from the spiritual and the countryblues cries of the negro such perpetual components of jazz as the diatonic scale melodic structures and compositional patterns stemmed from white european sources the current theoreticians of the souljazz movementsoul here being an ingroup synonym for negro as in soulbrothertrace the jazz patrimony to the negro southern baptist churches yet many great jazzmen negro and white born in connecticut or new mexico michigan or ontario owe little or nothing musically to such a background nor can syncopated rhythms almost the trademark for jazz be ascribed to a single source the evidence points to an amalgam of influences from west africa cuba the west indies and various sections of the united states though it may not be clear where interracial crossfertilization began the separation of the races as a factor in forming jazz history can hardly be overestimated segregation shaped in negro musicians certain characteristics widely imitated by whites who could not undergo firsthand the experiences that provided the emotional basis for much of the negros music not only were negro and white musicians unable to work together publicly but until the late s with rare exceptions they did not even mingle in the recording studios the original dixieland jazz band was heard on records from on there was no regular recording of negro jazz until about five years later even riversides valuable history of classic jazz sdp offers no real evidence of pre negro jazz except for a couple of ragtime solos transcribed to piano rolls once in gadsden alabama the musicians union refused to let three white members of fletcher hendersons band play a date until they had applied burnt cork to their faces even today the american federation of musicians has segregated locals in chicago and many other cities louis armstrong an illustrious son of new orleans may never again play there because local law will not let him bring his mixed band because of such anomalies of american society the exchange of musical ideas between races was long confined to private meetings occasional sittingsin of white musicians with negro bands and vice versa and the radiothe last mainly a source of white jazz since whites had a nearmonopoly of the jobs with the best air time recordings were less influential than might be assumed the s by louis armstrong fletcher henderson bessie smith and others were branded as race records sold largely in negro neighborhoods and purchased by whites only when they visited these ghettos the broadcasting of records was a minor factor since there were no disc jockeys in the s and early s despite these obstacles an interchange did occur during the twenties and thirties armstrong earl hines coleman hawkins and fats waller reached and influenced thousands of young white musicians bix beiderbecke was a source of inspiration to negro trumpeters rex stewart used to play bixs famous singin the blues chorus note for note and frank trumbauers saxo ph one style impressed such youngsters as lester young and benny carter in benny goodman shattered the barrier by taking teddy wilson out on the road as a member of his trio but the taboos still prevented his incorporation into the bandhe was considered a separate added attraction slowly the public image of allwhite and allnegro groups changed but it was not until the late s that mixed combos and bands were common if the american jazzman was aware of the negros role in the music they shared the white public even many jazz fans had little knowledge of it a glance at the annual metronome poll in shows that guitarist charlie christian was the only negro winner in the eleven categories at a time when benny carter coleman hawkins jimmy blanton j c higginbotham roy eldridge and ella fitzgerald were at their peaks the winners in their respective categories were toots mondello tex beneke bob haggart tommy dorsey ziggy elman and helen oconnell negro musicians ideas tunes and arrangements were duplicated for fun and profit in dehydrated versions by whites as witness glenn millers bonanza with tuxedo junction borrowed from erskine hawkinss band in the midst of such surroundings some of todays angriest jazzmen the max roaches and charlie minguses who speak most loudly of racial injustice were growing to maturity and observing that the negro was getting less than his full creditand financial reward it is not hard to understand why crow jim the antiwhite feeling of the past few years and the second wrong that does not make a right arose as the product of decades of jim crow during the past twenty years there has been a sharp change in the attitude of the american public little by little negroes have gained majority status as jazz musicians while the tendency to equate jazz authenticity with dark skina trend that began some years ago in francehas become more widely established though ellington basie and gillespie have been using white musicians off and on for years the young white musician now finds it increasingly harder to gain acceptance among his negro contemporaries and among many negro and some white jazz fans there is a growing and highly vocal minority of negro musicians to whom the presence of a white man in a negroled band is galling several negro leaders and negro sidemen working for white bands have been asked why do you hire a white man when a negro is available or similarly why do you work for this ofay band and make it sound good stay with your own fortunately most jazzmen reject the notion that jazz is solely the province of the negro and agree that it is as wrong to exclude whites from jazz as to forbid negroes to play bach or stravinsky interracial cooperation has produced some of the most vital recorded jazz of our day miles davis and gil evans john lewis and gunther schuller dizzy gillespie and lalo schifrin sonny rollins and jim hall and so forth the primary influence upon ella fitzgerald was the radio voice of connee boswell and negro guitarist wes montgomery greatly admired django reinhardt a few years ago roy eldridge bet me he could distinguish white from negro musicians on records and the muchcited results of the blindfold test published in down beat demonstrated that there was no such thing as a negro style in jazz eldridge did not even get as many right answers as the law of averages entitled him to it is true of course that certain jazz styles are commonly associated with negro musicians for example the style of horace silver and other combos that record for blue note records is played almost exclusively by negroes similarly a certain saxophone style is nearly always identified with white musicians such as stan getz and zoot sims but there are exceptions in both cases the important point is that both have been created by social and aesthetic influences and have nothing to do with skin color one has only to observe the negroes of nonamerican origin as i did in my teens in england to pierce the illusion british negro jazzmen were and still are no more adept than their white colleagues at developing the feeling for the jazz beat that seems second nature to so many americans today in fact there is a wide range of musical approaches among negro jazzmen some such as john lewis deeply involved with orchestral developments are closer to european traditions than to the core of jazz while others like max roach more concerned with improvisations and rhythm are seeking kinship with their african ancestors and cousins still others dizzy gillespie for example draw the best from both camps and manage to combine pragmatic realism with a sense of humor despite the rapidly changing social climate and its effect on the world of music jazz will almost certainly continue to be an interracial art form a spirit of good will still prevails between most negro and white musicians despite the pressure from the disenchanted and the dissident these last are sure only of what they are against while the majority is sure of what it is for the right to work play and live together on equal terms jazzmen of the past especially those who fought stubbornly to mix their bands at a time when this was hazardous and financially risky have played a laudable part in helping to eliminate racial barriers those of the present and future no matter what some current skirmishes may seem to indicate will in my view carry forward the initiative of their precursors what the black muslims believe by elijah muhammad this is the question asked most frequently by both the whites and the blacks the answers to this question shall state as simply as possible we want freedom we want a full and complete freedom we want justice equal justice under the law we want justice applied equally to all regardless of creed or class or color we want equality of opportunity we want equal membership in society with the best in civilized society we want our people in america whose parents or grandparents were descendants from slaves to be allowed to establish a separate state or territory of their owneither on this continent or elsewhere we believe that our former slave masters are obligated to provide such land and that the area must be fertile and minerally rich we believe that our former slave masters are obligated to maintain and supply our needs in this separate territory for the next to yearsuntil we are able to produce and supply our own needs since we cannot get along with them in peace and equality after giving them years of our sweat and blood and receiving in return some of the worst treatment human beings have ever experienced we believe our contributions to this land and the suffering forced upon us by white america justifies our demand for complete separation in a state or territory of our own we want freedom for all believers of islam now held in federal prisons we want freedom for all black men and women now under death sentence in innumerable prisons in the north as well as the south we want every black man and woman to have the freedom to accept or reject being separated from the slave masters children and establish a land of their own we know that the above plan for the solution of the black and white conflict is the best and only answer to the problem between two people we want an immediate end to the police brutality and mob attacks against the socalled negro throughout the united states we believe that the federal government should intercede to see that black men and women tried in white courts receive justice in accordance with the laws of the landor allow us to build a new nation for ourselves dedicated to justice freedom and liberty as long as we are not allowed to establish a state or territory of our own we demand not only equal justice under the laws of the united states but equal employment opportunitiesnow we do not believe that after years of free or nearly free labor sweat and blood which has helped america become rich and powerful that so many thousands of black people should have to subsist on relief charity or live in poor houses we want the government of the united states to exempt our people from all taxation as long as we are deprived of equal justice under the laws of the land we want equal educationbut separate schools up to for boys and for girls on the condition that the girls be sent to womens colleges and universities we want all black children educated taught and trained by their own teachers under such schooling system we believe we will make a better nation of people the united states government should provide free all necessary text books and equipment schools and college buildings the muslim teachers shall be left free to teach and train their people in the way of righteousness decency and self respect we believe that intermarriage or race mixing should be prohibited we want the religion of islam taught without hindrance or suppression these are some of the things that we the muslims want for our people in north america this material appeared originally in the black muslim journal muhammad speaks how to stamp out the dope racket by atty s carter mcmorris his writer is a member nps f of the legal profession i p and as such has had considerable experience in criminal trials and appeals i am also a member of society and i hope a publicspirited member there are those who would say that there is a conflict between the two positions that a criminal lawyer is necessarily at odds with the best welfare of society in that he uses every device at his command to preserve the freedom of alleged law violators w including dope pushers however one of the basic tenets of my philosophy is that society has only the criminals it deserves and that the function of the criminal lawyer is to protect from social persecution those unfortunate victims of our collective confusions whom we seek to make the scapegoats for the wrongs of alltoocriminal community much of the income of todays criminal lawyer is derived from defense of people accused of narcotics law violations yet i wish that this source of income were completely eliminated at this point my position as a member of society dominates that of defender of the accused the use of narcotics has such dire individual and social consequences that i fear for our general welfare unless something is done to curb it however in my opinion the proposals and approach of those people albeit wellmeaning who consider jail a panacea for all our social problems will only increase the dope peril this is true because the get tough approach will be no more effective in the case of narcotics than it was in the case of alcohol all too soon we seem to have forgotten the lessons of our prohibition blunder which led to repeal in short years during which the criminal world ran rampant in its pushing of illegal booze get tough legislation made possible the a capones and lucky lucianos of that era similar legislation in the narcotics field will necessarily result in the same sort of breakdown in fact has already done so to an extent not fully yet appreciated legislative fiat in connection with the narcotics problem like that perennially proposed by the womens christian temperance union for control of the beverage use of alcohol will prove a miserable failure because however desirable it may be theoretically it fails to take into account the realities of human nature in particular the weaknesses of human nature which lead to most of our problems personal or international in the first place the specific weaknesses which are at the root of the narcotics problem are ignorance and greed ignorance of the user who becomes a victim before he realizes the facts of addiction greed of the pusher who will risk anything because of the tremendous profits involved finally greed of the lawenforcement officer who often looks the other way when sufficient bribe is offered by the wellheeled men who run the illicit narcotics business such as the mafia or cosa nostra the get tough policy also fails to take into consideration the fact that detection on a large enough scale to get at the root of the problem is wellnigh impossible no matter how many skilled federal and state narcotics officers are retained at the expense of the taxpayers this is true because of the constitutional ruling that private premises and persons may not be invaded or searched by such officers unless they have a warrant or probable cause case after case has been dismissed against known and proven dope possessors or sellers because their constitutional rights were violated by the arrresting officers narcotics violations being necessarily of a private nature involving no protesting victim is especially susceptible to protection against police trespass of even greater pertinence and effect is a recent decision of the united states supreme court in a case appealed to it by this writer which holds that narcotics addicts must now be m treated not penalized for their condition this decision leaves open to the states at least three approaches to the addict they may simply leave him alone concentrating their efforts solely upon the dealers the real criminals albeit created and preserved by our asinine approach of the past which has failed to recognize the sociomedical as distinguished from criminal nature of addiction secondly the addict may be subjected to forced hospitalization confinement treatment this approach while consistent with the courts edict will have little or no effect on the overall problem because it will reach only those addicts who are caught since very few will voluntarily submit to compulsive treatment this leaves yet a third method which it is the purpose of this writing to explain and advocate and which is commonly known as the free clinic plan of narcotics legalization by legalization we mean not that dope may be supplied or administered by a street peddler corner grocer bartender or even druggist what is meant is that a person who is shown by appropriate tests to be an addict may be given sufficient quantities of the needed drug to make him comfortable unless he voluntarily submits to a cure perhaps under persuasion encouragement and education to the facts of addiction in which case such cure may be attempted in either event the drug may be supplied only by a duly licensed physician and administered under his guidance clinics should be established or enlarged so that the narcotics may be supplied at nominal cost or no cost at all because the prime consideration is to take the profits out of dope pushing it all adds up to a choice of the lesser of two evils in the first place i do not personally see dope use or government supply in free clinics as so much a moral issue as a question of individual and public health i do not think that the use of dope is basically any different from or more immoral than the use of alcohol or cigarettes nicotine itself being a narcotic the only reason why it does not kill off more people being that most of it goes up in smoke as contrasted with the mainline injection of heroin into the veins i do not think that anyone should use narcotics or tobacco or alcohol perhaps but i do not think the use can be stopped by force it is here that ignorance comes in and its counterpart education the only way to prevent the use of harmful substances privately when such substances supply an imagined need is mass education regarding the effects on health and longevity of such indulgence coupled with taking the profits out of the supply of the product involved there must be practical realistic reasons why people should or should not engage in any specific conduct which can be understood if properly presented and the reason why so many people do what they shouldnt is simply that wrong ideas are literally sold while proper conduct is not advanced because of lack of profits because of the secret private nature of dope use and sales the punishment approach only increases the problem as in the old saying that if you pluck out one gray hair two others will grow in its place when one narcotic addict is incarcerated one or more will take his place in the dope market recruited by the pusher or other addicts to be rejoined by the old one when he gets out of confinement thus increasing the problem by geometric progression treatment and free supply for addicts who can not or will not quit will while not curing those now addicted rare if not impossible in the present state of knowledge medical and otherwise prevent the recruiting or spread of this vicious habit because of the billions of dollars in profits annually use of narcotics does not lead naturally or directly to crime users are forced into crime because they cannot get a free or cheap supply of the substances that they feel they must have or suffer even die they will do anything to get such supply preferring nonviolent crimes if possible so that arrest will be less likely at the same time those who control the supply can charge exorbitant rates because of the tremendous compulsion of dope use an artificial but insistent hunger as compelling as the appetite for food or sex finally lawenforcement officers by choice or chance will concentrate on arresting masses of little pushers usually with only enough activity to keep up their own habit while accepting graft and bribes from the really big narcotics dealers in those rare instances when such are caught as senator daniel points out an arrested smuggler or peddler hardly misses the few thousand dollar bills he puts up for bail bond and his fine how much more willingly will he pay the same amount or even more for police protection in short enforcement will not work because no one will try to make it work and because only a small part of the traffic can be detected the user will not voluntarily surrender to enforced punishment or treatment the pusher will risk anything short of death perhaps even death for the immense return on his investment the policeman will in significant instances fail to enforce the law because of his own greed his desire to share in the profits of dope addiction coupled and justified in his mind by his own recognition of the futility of the present methods thus the get tough policy will not work there is no real alternative therefore to the free clinic plan addicts will cooperate if they are treated humanely and if they can participate voluntarily rather than by compulsion they will prefer safe medical treatment to the risk of death by overdose in the hands of the underworld many of them will be able to hold jobs now impossible for them since as much as a day may be required for an extreme habit so that all their time must be spent in attempting to acquire big money quickly through prostitution burglary shoplifting and dope pushing on their own in the main under the medicalpsychiatric treatment approach a few may find it possible to quit the habit though it seems to me that we are missing the boat if we emphasize curing those now addicted in the present state of medical knowledge of the problem the important thing is to prevent the recruiting of other addicts to nip the traffic in the bud finally with addicts getting the injections they need or want in clinics not to take out to give or sell to others but in injections scientifically prepared to last for say a day or longer there will be no incentive for pushers to seek new victims who will only turn to the clinics if they become addicted no one wants to make another an addict simply to see him use dope profit is involved in every case consciously or unconsciously a man may lead his wife or girl friend to the needle and turn her to prostitution because he cannot make enough otherwise to support his own habit for example not because he wants her to share his misery mass education in school by press radio and television will take the ignorance out of the dope problem the free clinic plan will take the profits out this realistic approach can and will work and it is the only thing that will work in the present imperfect state of human evolution as a criminal lawyer i would like to be one of the first to sacrifice that portion of my income attributable indirectly to the narcotics traffic on the altar of human betterment unless these steps are taken at once i fear such a spread of this vicious social sickness as indicated by the dire prediction of one of my clients we had better prepare for a pushbutton war if war comes again there will not be enough health and vigor left in our youth to fight any other kind negro ministers have not failed have sociologists by rev charles h king jr rapierlike thrust of t j dr hares sociologit cal insights into the bocy o the nes ro ministry have negro ministers failed their roles left most of us bleeding and bewildered midway through his article i was tempted to throw off my passion for presiding and seek the comfortable confines of black muslimdom where he reports per cent of my brethren have already found solitude where did dr hare obtain his axe his admission that he is the son of a baptist minister causes further concern how long has this talented young man ignored the couch of analysis at the expense of maintaining his sublimated hostilities surely the deep seated frustration toward the negro church and its ministry must have stunted both his respect for propriety and his training as a sociologist as a former pugilist his ungloved fists struck the negro church in the solar plexis its ministry i have read with great care and appreciation the other articles by dr hare printed in negro digest these articles revealed a great talent for analytical insights into the problems of a rapidly changing society some showed the unmistakable stroke of genius now for dr hare to take to task the spiritual leaders of the christian church to me is a prostitution of his acknowledged abilities the problem of understanding the role of the minister is not his alone a surprisingly large number of laymen have too long looked into the pulpit for the symbol of the religionist consequently minimizing their own role as stewards of the christian faith elton trueblood in his book alternative to futility correctly identifies this phenonemon we confuse the notion of being professionally pastoral with the notion of being professionally religious this widespread notion of a man of the cloth a variant of the primitive notion of medicine man is wholly pernicious by making religion as a profession rather than a vocation the ordinary member is relieved of a sense of urgent responsibility and becomes a spectator when he ought to be a participator in short if ministers have failed in their role it is as a consequence of the attendant failure within the pews however the rebuttal is not based on this premise first of all the minister does not hide behind the pious shield of infallibility god forbid the negro church is not rome neither does its ministry claim popeship such a shield if presented would justifiably serve as the instrument to unfrock us as all of us are bathed in the waters of human frailty again back to the pews we do not entirely blame backsliders elijah muhammad and the bowling alley for the drastic decline in negro attendance but some of the blame must be shared by those like dr hare who view the church with critical eyes while possessing supurb intellectsand idle hands these are the ones who refuse to share the responsibility of the stewardship of their talents to assist the church with its multitudinous problems he then bemoans the passing of the shepherd pastor what does he suggestthat the church of is the church of his childhood either he is being naive or he fails to employ the interpretive science of his calling it would be the height of folly for me to interpret the changes of the social order just as it was folly for dr hare to correctly gauge the changes of the religious order however since war has been declared i shall risk the front lines with his own weapons charles s johnson in his book the shadow of the plantation stated the church is the one outstanding institution in the community over which the negroes themselves exercise control it offers the only medium for community feeling this is a correct definition and it fits well into the retarded age into which the eminent sociologist would retire but this definition of the negro church was made in a close look at the negro church today defies such a definition the year that he cries out for the return of the shepherd pastor is the same year that the sheep have outgrown their pasture and are now grazing in the total environment of a rapidly integrated society what shepherd can bloom with these sheep indeed it is fortunate that he has time to shake their hand as they leave the church for the complexities of living has become their fold and the shepherd does well to even glimpse their fleeing forms the shepherd pastor has been relegated to the task of an administratorexecutive and the minister who fails to exercise administrative tasks is in severe straits he will soon find himself in a maze of embellishments that would either drive him to the couch of a psychiatrist or to the campus of howard university there he could observe dr hare and write an article for negro digest entitled have negro sociologists failed their roles to say that dr hares article is without some merit would be absurd we share his chagrin at the deplorable spectacle of our embattled conventions the squabbles church splits and struggles for power however these are exceptions and extraordinary exceptions at that the overwhelming majority of churches and ministers are far removed from the chaotic picture that he paints concerning the days that he deplores nothing would please the minister more than to eliminate these days from the church womens day mens day etc have two reasons for perpetuation the first is that those who are able to support the church disgrace it with their pittances secondly the vast majority of negro church membership constitutes those who suffer deprivation and are on the bottom rung of the economic totem pole suffice it to say the church where dr hare probably attends was built in the past by the welcome coins from days dr hare can illafford to criticise the ministers in the freedom struggle if ministers have used their special position in the negro struggle due to their freedom from white economic pressure and their access to a more or less permanent multitude of ready made followers god bless them and more power to them if the jails could speak they would tell the story of its inhabitants they would declare that their cells contained in virtually every southern state the sons the daughters of the church and the black prophets who led them there the publicity received is a mere byproduct of the cause and in many instances a most necessary byproduct for if the trumpet makes an uncertain sound who shall respond to battle remove from the struggle for freedom the names of martin_luther_king wyatt t walker fred shuttlesworth ralph abernathy kelly miller smith gardner taylor father gibson and other ministers known and unknown and what do you have more is involved here than a passion for presiding and the search for publicity rather let us believe it is a passion for freedom and a search for justice whether these men ride south as freedom riders or sitdown in their own backyards in mississippi it is bringing about a change in the conditions of a disenfranchised race recently in a conversation with rev edward j odom church secretary for the naacp he told me that of the churches he visited this year the backbone of the entire negro revolt was the negro church and its minister he said take away the negro preacher and the church and the movement will lose its fervor and religious motivation this blow struck by dr hare must be classified as one that hit below the belt without question this round of criticism must be taken away from him the men of god yell foul let this be well known dr j h jackson president of the national baptist convention and millionaire s b fuller are not the images of todays ministers the vast majority of negro ministers cannot afford to drive big cars take trips to russia or fly to make addresses the balance of their time is devoted to picketing confronting the white power structure in behalf of their people visiting the sick burying the dead and agonizing over impossible budgets and then of course preaching the gospel even this dr hare takes to task he would have the negro minister devote his time to considering the horrors of war and speaking out against the massive murder of modern warfare yes it is true we do have lockjaw on this subject an introspective view of war reveals that it is as a consequence of sin in high places what need of battering at the walls of war to a people who possess neither the power nor the instruments to wage warfare why preach the evils of war even to white christiandom when they fail to hear the basic message of love thy neighbor why spend time on advocating global disarmament while rocks are in the hands of white supremacist why argue for a peace treaty with russia while negroes have no communication with the white communities of birmingham and albany ga dr hares remarks on the war records of ministers were so juvenile that to frame a rebuttal would be futile and who might i ask living or dead black or white has added to the wisdom of moses solomon and job if it is true that the negro minister has failed in his role and that church members are flocking en masse to black muslims then his article has abetted such movement incidentally dr hare has a continuous theme of attributing to the muslims qualities that should be possessed by christiandom what are those qualities dare he suggest that morality includes hate indeed the tenor of his speech suggests he is closely aligned with their doctrine if this is so and i know it is not then let him cease from his caustic comparisons and flee to join their ranks the corporeal sin committed by his article was that he failed to utilize his training as a social scientist it was obvious that most of his arguments were hampered by the loud emotional overtones of personal frustration as such he created a stereotype that a mere glance in his undergraduate notebook would have destroyed it is this there are more differences within a group than there are between groups he weakly tries to cover for this sociological error by stating that there are exceptions thank you doctor he adds but exceptions are no refutations of the general condition for shame if the picture that he painted is generally the one of the church and its ministry then i agree with him god help us all for we are men most miserable and not even sidling up to the lawd for reprieve will satisfy our quest for refuge but one escape remains if the leak in the ark of the church is as destructive as outlined by dr hare let us all disembark for our spiritual lives perhaps the muslims will provide us a lifeboatwithout oars race and big business by jackie robinson any american businessmen feel threatened by the current fastspreading negro revolution they have read the page one news of the demonstrations boycotts selective buying campaigns picketing drives and economic withdrawal programs they know that entire communities like birmingham have been thrown into chaos because there is a new militant negro in the land industry knows that this negro is aware that he is million strong and has billion to spend annually the financial newspapers and magazines the confidential business reports and trade publications reveal that a number of important corporations have recently changed employment patterns the american businessman particularly in metropolitan markets with substantial nonwhite populations wonders nervously where the next offensive will be mounted in my opinion both as a negro passionately concerned about civil_rights and as a business executive deeply interested in the health of our economy this threat to the business community can be transformed from a negative into a positive this damocleslike sword can be refashioned into a plowshare which can help to bring a rich harvest of opportunity to american businessmen who are enlightened and progressive enough to lead i do not believe the american businessman up until this time has demonstrated the kind of leadership regarding this domestic crisis which he owes to his own enterprise and to his nations economy by and large he has emphasized the negative he has fear and apprehension he views with alarm the new aggression of marching negroes i suggest that the time has come to go forward with all the courage persuasion and determination with which in the past he has helped make this country a frontrunner in world commerce if the american businessman takes this initiative it is my belief that he will be able to work out a treatya practical working relationship between negroes and whiteswhich can insure our eco nomy not only peace but justice on the racial front it was the business leadership of birmingham which under the most unfavorable and tense conditions found the way to make peace with those who were spearheading the negro protest it was not the state government the city government the religious or civic leaders who moved to bring a halt to the dangerous and seemingly hopeless stalemate between what negroes wanted and what antiintegrationists and governor wallace wanted them to have it was i repeat business leadership this happened i must emphasize in a city which has been called the worst city in terms of race relations it happened at the height of crisis in an atmosphere a few hot breaths removed from lynching during one of the most crucial meetings between the businessmen and negro leaders of birmingham youngsters were on the march in the streets outside yet a pact was made between reasonable men how much easier and more sensible it would be to resolve our racial problems before demonstrations occur before the picketing before violence erupts before we have been backed into corners and have no other alternative than to try to find reason in an atmosphere of emotion and anger why wait until your community or your business is in the throes of boycott why put aside even for another moment recognition of the undeniable justice of the aspirations of the negro to be accepted into the mainstream of our society economic and otherwise for even if that recognition does not come in your own mind it is inevitably coming in the laws and mores of our society even those who vigorously deny the negros right to equality know that they are projecting a doomed philosophy the most rigid segregationists today are no longer shouting never if they are you can believe that in their hearts they mean not just yetlater they are fighting a holding action seeking to delay full integration i make this appeal through sales management to the nations sales executives because i know that the acumen of this countrys captains of commerce and industry has been one of the major factors in our attainment of superiority in world commerce i know that american leaders have brilliantly anticipated future trends upon which to base present decisions i cannot understand why with all this talent and perception the heads of our great corporations and enterprises have not moved with positiveness to meet the great potentials in the current racial situation they love america as i love america can it be that they have been fooled into believing that the negro revolution is unamerican if this be true then they have forgotten that we would not be here as america had it not been for another revolution which sought vindication of justice and the dignity of the human personality the moderate leaders of the negro revolutionroy wilkins dr martin_luther_king jr whitney young a philip randolph james farmerseek for the negro today only what america promised all of its citizens yesterday and that is the reason they are unwilling to wait until tomorrow howtodaycan the american businessman move positively to meet the challenge of this revolution to strengthen american economy and to enter into an exciting competition for the billion negro market here are some suggestions throw open the doors to the negro on an equal basis do this not only because it is fair that he should have his share in our economy but also because he has a contribution of talent and loyalty to offer to your enterprise do it also because you will demonstrate to the negro consumer that you want his business a friend of ours a new york city industrial relations man has perceptively described the negro market as an invitational market open the doors of job opportunity to colored people and not only will they come in as valuable employees but you will find you have won the consumer loyalty of the negro how will you find qualified competent negroes in virtually every metropolitan city there is a branch of the national urban league for years this organization guided and aided not only by top negro social scientists but also by enlightened white businessmen and philanthropists has been working in the area of expanding employment opportunities for the negro the urban league is not an employment agency but it stands ready and willing to help supply negro personnel particularly in breakthrough situations or special job categories which have not been available to negroes in the past there are other ways by which negro employees can be found advertise in the negro newspapers you dont have to make any special appeal in these ads negro applicants will know they are welcome when they see your advertisement in their press communicate with high schools colleges and universities contact civic organizations which are working in the field of race relations let it be known among the negro clergy that your doors are open for qualified people the negro clergy has been in the forefront of the struggle for jobs along with the naacp and other groups so by contacting the churches you are going right to the source from which the anti demonstrations have been coming you are turning a negative into a positive you are advertising not only your intentions to give jobs but your interest in the market the masses of the negro people are churchbased for years business people have said i would hire negroes but it would destroy the morale of my present employees they would refuse to work with negroes hogwash in many cases heads of businesses have utilized this argument as a device to camouflage their own prejudices in many other cases there has been a genuine fear of resentment by white employees it is my belief that the vast majority of whites will not leave good decent job situations because negroes are brought in to work by their side the key to acceptance of negroes by white employees is the firmness of the boss to be a good businessman one has to be a good leader vacillate and the battle will be lost the chairman of the board of chock full onuts william black the man who hired me as a vice president when i left baseball is one businessman who didnt vacillate years before i joined the company at the very outset of setting it up mr black decided he would hire any qualified person regardless of race or color he made this decision because he felt it was the right thing to do and he has continued the policy over the years not only have we maintained a tremendous amount of support from whites we have also over the years before my coming to the company and after enjoyed a tremendous amount of loyalty and support from negroes this is true not alone because of my relationship with the company but also because the negro public knows that the negro can work at chock its a bit embarrassing to say what i am about to say but it makes my point and i cant help being human enough to be proud of it ive been told in some of the stores in harlem where our coffee is sold that some people ask not for chock full o nuts coffee but for that jackie robinson coffee this isnt so much a personal tribute to me as it is indicative of the hunger which the negro has for identification his desire to be a part of what is really going on in our country his pride when one of his own gets recognition and his loyalty to those who give it as i pointed out above the policy of our company allows not only for hiring without discrimination but for hiring people regardless of race on all levels and upgrading those who are deserving one of the serious problems the negro faces today is that some companies which will hire him without qualms will not allow him to advance to whatever position his ability might actually entitle him to the enterprising young negro today wants not only a paycheck but a potential if he has within himself the ability to advance in his company he does not want to believe he will be allowed to go just so far and no further it must be discouraging to him to make a study of topechelon corporations in america and find how few important jobs are held by negroes to my knowledge there are only three negro vice presidents in their executive ranks the two other negroes besides myself who hold vice presidencies in large companies are george olden the brilliant senior art director at mccannerickson and harvey russell who has done a splendid job with pepsicola when chock named me a vice president a friend of mine who is in public relations told me that my appointment marked the first time to his knowledge that the name and picture of a negro had appeared in the financial pages of the new york times when these youngsters realize that their race spends billions of dollars in america and that thousands of talented young negroes are graduating from colleges and universities yearly it must seem that progress in the placement of executive and managerial personnel is snaillike as to white employees and executives respecting authority given to a negro i have had no trouble in this regard one of the reasons is that when i was named to my job it was made very clear to everyone by our board chairman william black who was president and samuel ostrove who is now president that i had full unquestioned authority over personnel when i first joined chock i did not want to believe i was being taken on simply because my career in baseball had made me a well known person i would not be able to stomach being used as a puppet with someone else pulling the strings i want to work for my money and to be respected and respect others mr black straightened out my apprehensions immediately making me realize that my appointment was not just one of those spectacular moves to capitalize on publicity the longer you are with this company the better off well all be he told me personnel is your job and i want you to do it i said above that i know of only three vice presidents with top companies i do not know of some smaller companies that have tried to win the negro market by taking on some popular negro and giving him a highsounding title with no authority and often no compensation equivalent to the supposed stature of the job this is tokenism these days negroes are becoming more and more alert to the tokenist approach in politics as well as in business if you hire negroesand you shouldmake them aware of the fact that they can advance as high as their ability and the companys table of organization can take them when you promote them to a position of authority pay them what the job commands and let everyone realize that they have real responsibility it is then up to them to produce and if they dont they deserve no special consideration because they are negroes get rid of them just as fast as you would anyone elsebut not faster demonstrating to the negro not only that your door is open but also that he can climb the stairway of career advancement will bring you people of high caliber who might otherwise seek opportunity elsewhere i have heard complaints from heads of business who say look i want to hire negroes but i cant get any to apply i had a negro applicant the other day who came in for a job when i asked him what he wanted to do he was looking for a janitors job and you know what he had a college education tragically this does happen one of the reasons is that for so long regardless of qualifications and background the negro has been led to believe that only the menial positions are open to him so often he doesnt even bother to try nor is he willing to settle for the lowest type of work there are thousands and thousands of young negroes who would go into companies which to their knowledge had a training program and a fair promotion system they would be willing to start in minor jobs and work at trainee salaries if they had the confidence that there was somewhere to go undoubtedly there are many companies where such conditions exist but negroes dont know it there ought to be some kind of link between these wellintentioned firms and the negro public one solution to this is the hiring of a top negro personnel executive or public relations man or retraining a negro who has intelligence integrity and a balanced understanding of the problems both of the negro and of the white employer who wants to integrate beware however of the adviser there are people like this in every racewho wants to give you only the kind of advice he thinks will please you you are much better off doing business with someone who tells you what he thinks you ought to know rather than what he feels you might want to hear there are two other developments in the nature of the new militant negro he wants to look forward to becoming a race of producers as well as consumers and he wants identification with products on which he is spending his money i have been made very much aware of the interest of the negro in his own economic stabilization within our society recently when the new york times carried a story that i was associated with a group which was seeking a charter to establish a bank in harlem i received many inquiries from negroes who wanted to invest to buy stock or who just wanted to say that this is the kind of thing our people should be doing developing and creating more enterprises of our own although i feel that in the establishment of major business enterprises the negro ought to take initiative and corral group support white businessmen bankers and financiers can help negro entrepre neurs by lending a hand both in counseling and financially as to the negros desire for identification the question has been asked of me whether i thought negroes want negro salesmen calling upon them representing companies and products while i do not feel that negro salesmen ought to be confined only to negro neighborhoods i do believe that representation of companies by negroes appeals to the negro consumer we observed in harlem not long ago a conflict between negro liquor salesmen and the liquor companies and distributors harlem is one of the most lucrative markets for retail liquor sales the community rallied behind negro salesmen who were denied assignments within their own community apparently because earnings within that community were much larger than in certain other areas here we had an example of the negro being denied opportunities created by the money spent by his own people right in his own backyard the sales field is one which offers so much potential to ambitious energetic people the negro wants in on it and negro consumers have begun to question why there cannot be more negro representation in this area this is one form of identification another is in advertising recently the new york telephone co ran a series of ads in which a modestly dressed averageappearing negro was standing in a street phone booth making a call it was an unsensationally executed brilliant coup for this ad received tremendous attention and i am sure did a splendid public relations job in the minds of many negro people who after all do use telephones too another development which caused much conversation was a recent issue of the new york times which carried several pictures of fashion models one of them was an attractive negro girl this was the first time many of us had seen a negro fashion model in a metropolitan daily i am sure no sensible whites were insulted i am certain many negroes felt a glow and i am willing to wager that this innovation did the manufacturer of the clothes the girl was wearing no harm it makes us feel good to realize america is beginning to realize that we are here that we contribute to the economy a friend of mine told me the other day that he had opened an account at a new york bank he had picked that bank because it has had several television commercials featuring diahann carroll the lovely negro actress the success won by companies which give the negro a sense of identification by using negro models can be measured when one leafs through one of americas finest publications ebony magazine john h johnson ebonys publisher was a pioneer in proving to manufacturers that the negro wanted a feeling of affiliation with their products and that one way to accomplish this was to utilize negro models ebonys million annual advertising volume substantiates the argument to date most companies and advertising agencies are fearful of running the same kind of advertisment that appears in ebony in magazines like life i am hopeful that we are going to wake up some morning soon and pick up our socalled white publications and see a crowd picture with negroes in it or a sandlot ball team which is not lily white i believe some forwardlooking businessmen are going to stop trying to keep it a secret that we are here and that we also spend yankee dollars and i dont believe there will be another civil war or white boycott if a cigarette company runs a back page ad featuring duke ellington smoking a cigarette i know there are attitudes which have existed for years i know there are problems which will not be solved simply i also know there is a tremendous challenge and a tremendous task ahead for americas business community answering the challenge will take imagination and boldness the reward can be more business for you from the billion market and a sense of having done a good thing for america by p a bullins whats hap ittl pening have you ljl made the scene yet t what

from the governor and the mayor and showed them to me her happiness seemed so pathetic so wanting of something which is essential to happinessbelief that i felt sorry for her imagine she said hugging me effusively the governor and the mayor wrote me me thats a fine action on the part of the governor and the mayor i told her handing back the standard informal letters which bore the signatures of the two officials stamped by anonymous clerks well you can stay here for the rest of your life now i told her she turned on me as though i had cursed her who me not me and these people i can never be an american but you have citizenship now that doesnt mean anything citizenship doesnt mean much to her she says in an effort to cover up what really means so much to her a woman past here in the usa for five years she doesnt want to be considered an american negro as a matter of fact shes ashamed of being an american negro and this is the standard neurosis of the average west indian immigrant he or she does not want to be considered an american negro subconsciously they believe that the white man prefers them as nonamerican negroes in short he wishes to be the white mans favorite nigger and he may well be happy because he seems to be succeeding in dehumanizing himself this is the color complex of the west indian negro one who doesnt understand the fight for freedom in america one who doesnt wish to understand it and one who even understanding it doesnt have any sympathy for it its a further chapter in the history of the international black mans effort to escape from his skin and his being i have yet to meet a west indian negro who doesnt feel he is better than the american negro and therefore equal to the american white with whom he wishes to associate not everybody born in the west indies can be a sydney poitier or a cleveland robinson two of the many west indians who have entered the mainstream of american life the majority whether they come from jamaica trinidad barbados or grenada or any other part of the caribbean seek to degrade the american negro somebody once said that the immigrant was a mad dog in search of any bone and every time he found a bone he would cross a bridge look down in the water see a larger bone drop his own and run down the bank of the river to be deceived by his unquenchability well the immigrant negro in america seems to be the mad dog with a bone in his mouthconstantly dropping it and finding othersthroughout this long search for an identity sometime ago i met a jamaican in a greenwich village bar i asked him whether he had become an american citizen no and never soon he was lashing out at the defects of the american negro and pretending to be holierthanthey in the castle of his unpopular skin they are animals he said they are this and they are that i challenged his statements oh you wouldnt know he parried you have to work with them he works with themwith some civil_rights organization in new york this young man is about years old he came here three years ago to study engineering now he works parttime with this civil_rights organization but what can he do in the interest of civil_rights buried down as he is with such prejudices back in jamaica his father is an executive member of some branch of the government his uncle is an internationally respected writer and in his island home hes a prince in a shoe and nobody dares call him nigger or any name to the effect but here in new york or any other part of the united states he struggles hes a black man a negro so in order to retain an identity which can set him apart from what he considers the irresponsible mob he stays in his caribbean closet im from jamaica he says when you meet him but he doesnt even have to say it the exact preservation of his accent will warn you however that still wont be enough to show you how much hes not a part of the american dilemma he will criticize american negroes even going so far as to openly call them niggers and as soon as his studies are finished he intends to return to his island home and become a small bureaucrat he is not unlike my aunt and the thousands of other aunts there are my aunt rents a room from a trinidadiana woman who is an american citizen a woman who has children born in america but a woman who would never stand to be called an american because once you make her an american you make her an american negro this woman spends her time thinking so many things of the american negro that in attempting to be such a generous thinker she generally manages to outsay those whites who think the worst of any negro they have no morals she says because they drink beer out of cans they dont know how to rear their children they are lazy and without ambition we came here she said meaning the thousands of west indians in the states and in so little time we have educated our children and bought so many apartment houses here in new york but they the american negroes talk of the south why dont they leave the south and come here you tell me i told her that hundreds of negroes leave the south every week in search of a better life but to no avail my words falling on deaf ears she will not rent her rooms to an american negro without the recommendation of someone she respects years ago she sent her daughter to a predominantly white school and the child was accepted as an american negro which she in fact was when she discovered that she branded the child to the childs protests by putting gold bracelets on her wristsbracelets being then a mark of west indianism i was talking to another woman she has two children one at vassar and the other at dartmouth we were discussing the negro childs search for an identity in america oh she said proudly my children never had those problems you know their father and i were born in the west indies immediately she seeks to unmake their americanhood she tells me not to think of them in the context of the average boy or girl because their parents are from the caribbean its the same with almost every west indian parent in the states the majority of them believe that the british system of education is much better than the american and some of them translate their belief by sending their children to study in the islands or in england one of their standard complaints is that the american child who doesnt have the good luck to grow up in the home of west indian parents ends up being badly behaved and ambitionless children in america they say are badly behaved not like kids in the west indies kids who never say no kids who are completely dependent on their parents even while in their twenties they like this type of spineless child but not the fastmoving american child in this tense and unfaithful society they believe that the american negro is ambitionless and uneducated and they maintain this belief even in the face of strong proof of the contrary because its part of the chain of beliefs which helps them to pass their days in another country a crutch to lessen their insecurity they want to see the unfavorable so they see it i have never been segregated says one who has spent years in the white mans kitchen cleaning his floors and suffering humiliations and i dont see why there should be so many demonstrations and so much unrest i know white people and theyre not so bad she is serious yes i tell her i know that you know the white man but you know him too well so well that you have forgotten yourself but im a fool she doesnt listen and i realize she will die believing the same thing so may god bless her in the west indies everyone jostles for the chance to come to america everyone its the extensive gold mine waiting for intrepid diggers and those who come here are generally teachers civil servants nurses skilled persons and students they come because they want a better life they come to study or they come to work usually they do both but there are also those who do nothing they come out of a society where to be black is a disadvantage once here they start working some of them get good jobs others work as porters waiters etc but regardless of what they are doing they send exaggerated reports of comfort to their island homes while they suffer what they accept as temporary indignities the porter seldom identifies himself with the successes or failures of the american negro since he cant get a better job he offsets the temporary indignity by joining societies and lodges and becoming a leading member one thing he always says he is much better off in the west indies he may return to live there after some years away but usually he stays here on his very tenuous montage thinking that the fact that he came to america as an immigrant and not as a slave makes him so different from the negroes whose forefathers were brought here in chains years ago there is no valid reason for tms hysteria and false pride the fact that the american negro may have laughed at the african or west indian several years ago is no justification for sniping for the sake of enhancing ones position in nomansland we play into the hands of those who hate us most whenever we naively seek to dish out the same medicine which we have been swallowing for so many centuries yet the tragic part of all this is the fact that we are all guilty in some way or the other of this very subtle crime my aunt is a victim of this society which seeks to put man in different cells of his imagination and milk his essencewhat little he has left of it to divide him and then rule him and when she tells me she is better than an american negro i tell her that what you are is always your constant companion and you can only run so far that when we amputate one leg to improve our gait we stumble and fall in the dust of our souls prices are high prejudice is low so far by julia gaines mighty a colored american living in anchorage alaska you would be living high on the totem pole racerelationswise alaska has some of a if the best antidiscrimination laws in existence and the proper machinery to carry them out despite the necessity of having to oil the machinery occasionally the colored citizens agree that the basic parts are sound as a colored cheechako arriving here cheechako means newcomer the amiable race relations are only one of the many surprises that await you if you expect to flounder in snow over your head gape at slanteyed eskimos on dogsleds yelling mush and live in claustrophobic igloosyoull be let down or up as the case may be with a bang at first glance anchorage looks like many of the towns in the south which is what alaskans call the rest of the united states with the snow leveled down by the huge snowplows almost before it stops falling you would have to jump into a snowbank to get it past your knees youd probably gape at slanteyed short stockylooking people passing by but you would be confused they wear plain shirts pants sweaters skirts etc and they may be japanese chinese indian filipino or just possibly eskimo anchorage has all these groups you would be surrounded by apartment houses splitlevels ranchtypes bungalows etc if you didnt look sharp you might be run down by a sports car a cadillac or a chevy but on second glance you would see visual evidence of many of the things youve read and heard about alaska sprinkled immodestly among the modern buildings are log cabins and shacks left over from the riproaring frontier days among the passing throng are many fiercelooking men with long hair and beards wearing roughlooking apparel and looking like characters from a jack london novel there are modern stores advertising supplies to pan for gold and food lockers to store the moose and caribou shot in the outlying areas around the town later you might try to classify anchorage the closest and most confusing description ive heard it called is a cosmopolitan big country town it has all the evils of the big city though in smaller quantities and all the warmth and simplicity of the little town the town largest in alaska and founded in as a construction camp for the alaska railroad sits on a bluff bordered on the east by the chugach mountain and on the west and north by cook inlet and the susitna valley the howling blizzards and subsubzero temperatures normally associated with alaska pay very irregular visits to anchorage many cheechakos spend considerable sums buying the beautiful fur parkas that you see the eskimos wearing on the picture postcards but in reality the same type of winter clothing worn in the northern great lakes region can be worn here with comfort average temperature for january is degrees below zero and for july degrees fahrenheit but to the uninitiated the most startling thing about the climate is the lack of daylight in winter and the lack of night in summer in the middle of winter there is as little as five and a half hours of daylight and most cheechakos find their first winter here very depressing however summer really takes the cake for eccentricity at oclock at night the sun is still shining bright enough to make little cheechako children believe theyre being tricked when theyre told its way past their bedtime but really frightening are the occasional earthquakes mild since ive been here that keep you posted as to just how insignificant man really is the estimated population is census with negroes within this general figure however this figure does not include negroes and others who may live outside the city proper the pioneer settlers of this town naturally were the rough and rugged individualists the goldseekers the furtrappers the law dodgers the prostitutes and adventurers but in later years a more stable group began arriving the farmers the constructionists homesteaders employees of the federal government and the professionals the present population consists of all these groups if you listened closely to the accents of the white and colored people on the streets in the schools in fact all around you you would notice that the far western and the slow southern drawls predominate if youre the type of colored cheechako steeped in the notion that all the white boogiemen and all the backward slowmoving negroes are from the deep south and the far west you would be doubly confused here although both groups predominantly speak that way there is something about their general bearing that implies friendliness and respect toward each other and strangers as well almost everyone is relatively new and they seem to have been too busy getting their feet on solid ground to resent the man beside them there is a general atmosphere of informality of trying to get ahead and of exciting things about to happen however generally speaking there is a lack of qualified leadership a recent editorial in the anchorage times said in speaking of alaska in general the two greatest problems wanting solution today are leadership and investment capital speaking of anchorage and the negro in particular there are no negro leaders as such although there are several outstanding negroes in the community when i asked several supposedly wellinformed negroes about this alleged lack of leadership one man commented there are a lot of would be leaders here yes we have great quantity but little quality this was the comment made most often on the other hand one woman said that since the colored folks are able to take a small or large part in almost everything here there hasnt been any necessity for a strong negro leader although there hasnt been enough racial dissension in anchorage to foster a martin_luther_kingtype leader the existence of a local naacp has certainly come in handy to say the least it was organized in and in spite of persistent internal bickering and external tongueclackings it has proven its worth to the community three of the bills sponsored by it and subsequently passed by the legislature benefit not only the negro but other minority groups as well they are fepcbill antidiscrimination bill in housing and human rights bill in august of the naacp sponsored a picketing of carrs a local supermarket because of its hiring practices within two months negroes were hired the anchorage naacp also participates in activities including negroes outside of alaska in june of this year a memorial service was held in memory of medgar evers the naacp leader killed in jackson miss a total of was raised at the services to send to mrs evers and her children senator ernst gruening dalaska sent a wire to the services indicating his complete accord with the actions of the naacp through consultations and meetings with housing authorities the naacp helped to open balky doors to several apartment houses for prospective negro tenants however housing discrimination is still the biggest whirlpool in a relative sea of calm because it is accomplished by subtle practices that defy pinpoint identification consciously or unconsciously the leading anchorage newspaper helps by printing ads from time to time of apartments or houses for rent for white only and for colored only if you were a cheechako colored or white looking for a job here and had no particular skill or training you might curse the day you arrived the population has grownand is still growingso rapidly that even the people already here face difficulties in gaining yearround employment especially those who do construction work or other jobs dependent more or less on construction work with the advent of so many people a permanent labor supply is already here at present it varies from during the peak summer months down to in winter so many people have come to anchorage expecting to find their fortunes and have been disillusioned until the anchorage chamber of commerce says in its informational tract on anchorage we strongly recommend that those in search of employment do not venture north without employment assured or have sufficient funds to draw upon until employment is secured at least per person plus return fare if job hunt is unsuccessful and we strongly recommend that those interested in business opportunities plan to take a trip and look the situation over firsthand for all groups living costs are high from december of throughout a friend of mine rented a threebedroom apartment bedrooms like closets for a month plus an average monthly utility bill plus an average a month for the coinoperated washer and dryer setup in the apartment basement no washing machines allowed in her apartment as you can see this comes to and food clothing medical expenses and recreation havent been mentioned if you wanted to buy a home in anchorage you would pay between three to five thousand more than you would pay for a home of similar build in new york for instance quite a few prefabricated houses are shipped here and sold and many people live in trailers because much of the food and other merchandise are imported these prices are high also however i must add that wages are quite high and buying from the large supermarkets chain department stores cutrate drugstores and discount houses helps to balance the increased living expenses even so if youre out of a job you can see that things might be a mite difficult there are no set figures but it is estimated that at least per cent of anchorage negroes work in construction and service jobs in addition to this many negroes work for the city state and federal government in fact the economy of anchorage is primarily dependent upon the government and the military you can hear quite often from disgruntled citizens if they take elmendorf air force base and fort rich away this town would go to the dogs there is more than a grain of truth in this statement but anchorage does have other economic activities going on anchorage is headquarters for the alaska railroad chief center for air transportation in alaska chief center of oil exploration products activities and principal market for the agricultural products of the matanuska and susitna river valleys also with the opening of the new presbyterian hospital and the staterun psychiatric institute plus the alaska native hospital and the providence hospital more jobs have been opened up there is a very small negro professional group in anchorage with teaching being the major occupation oddly enough there are no negro men teachers but at least women teachers mrs delbert henry an anchorage resident since and originally from oklahoma has been teaching in the schools since she agreed along with many others that qualified people can certainly get jobs here if jobs are available she is a member of delta kappa gamma only negro member in alaska an international teachers sorority and is president of the elite social and charity club in april of this year this club presented anchorage negroes their first debutante ball schools in anchorage maintain a very high academic standing and are rated among the best in the country there are two high schools three junior high schools over nine elementary schools a community college alaska methodist university several african students have attended this university and several private schools incidentally school kids are very happy here because even though school opens in early september it closes in midmay aside from teaching the professional group breaks down to one privatelypracticing dentist dr joshua j wright and one privatelypracticing lawyer mahala ashley dickerson both of these people are highly thought of in their field and have a mixed clientele there are several businesses purportedly owned by negroes mcsmith enterprises a store that sells rents and repairs tvs a grocery store a janitorial service a newspaper a cocktail lounge several night spots and a few small eating places there are one or two barbershops and beauty parlors if you need the help of a policeman in a hurry dont look for a colored onethere arent any however there is one attractive negro metermaid at the same time there are no friendly colored undertakers just friendly white ones negro churches as such are in the minority not more than six however negroes attend the church of their choice wherever it is located there are over churches with all denominations represented however the majority of the negro ministers i heard speak appeared to be more or less selfordained the masons are the prominent lodge in anchorage and sponsor many dances and dinners throughout the year these activities are usually wellattended negro participation in the political scene is quite limited but one name that pops up frequently in the news is that of mrs dolores watson an outstanding negro woman in the community mrs watson and her husband william have been anchorage residents for the last years coming originally from yakima washington mr watson came to anchorage to work for the federal government and liked the looks of the country so well that he and his wife decided to make it their permanent home mrs watson is a onetime president and present treasurer of the local naacp and is one of the few negroes who takes an active part in many phases of community life she made an unsuccessful bid for the city council in but still works indefatigably for street sewer and housing improvement she is one of the two negro members of the anchorage womens club a member of delta sigma theta sorority member of league of alaskan writers and member of the local chapter of the northern lights civic and social club she definitely likes anchorage and was quick to say yes when asked if she would recommend other negroes coming here to live mrs blanche mcsmith was the first and so far only negro to become a member of the state legislature she is on the board of directors of the naacp and is the other negro member of the anchorage womens club if youre the kind of cheechako who likes to booze it up you would be reel happy in anchorage there are cocktail lounges listed in the phone book with of them on fourth avenue the main street in town this doesnt include eating places that serve liquor and little backstreet dives if you stand at one end of fourth avenue at night the end near the inlet you will be dazzled by all the gaudy red lights beckoning to you but considering the number of lights and bars on fourth avenue its uncommonly quiet at night three night spots highly frequented by negro and a large percentage of white patrons are the club oasis the mermaid room and the back street club the club oasis and the mermaid room have lively floor shows with entertainers imported from the states and at times the club oasis presents as many as three shake dancers in each show there are four newspapers in anchorage the anchorage daily times and the daily news are the two leading newspapers neither have a sunday edition and serve the entire community this includes pictures of all local people church and society news then there are two newspapers slanted toward the negro community the alaska spotlight a weekly has been in business for about eleven years and is edited and published by mr george anderson it is a tiny newspaper almost a pamphlet but it reports items in proportion to its size from all over alaska and the south mr anderson is a republican who made two unsuccessful bids for a seat in the alaska house of representatives the midnight sun reporter is relatively new on the scene being less than two years old but so far it has presented much food for thought aside from its regular news it is also a weekly and is edited by mr jim owens but neither of the two latter newspapers are as strong as they might be if they were in a lessintegrated community if you are a tv fan you would see your programs but they would be shown two to three weeks later than they appear in the continental states there are two tv stations and four radio stations in anchorage one quite interesting event occurs on the channel morning show each morning except saturday and sunday an employee from the alaska state employment office appears on the program and reads a list of some of the jobs available at the employment service this works extra fine for jobseekers too bushed to get up early and head for the employment agency if youre a budding poet you may get your poetry read by the announcer on the same show that is if you send it in the entire show is rather informal but definitely pleasing the teenagers have their usual platterspinning tv show and are up on all the latest dancesthe sputnik waddle collegian swim pony push and kick etc although anchorage has a large juvenile delinquency problem juvenile criminals here lean heavily toward burglary theft and drunkenness it still seems to be a wonderful place to rear children it offers plenty of fresh air and much space to move around in the teenagers and some adults do a lot of skiing iceskating bowling and housetohouse partying in winter during the summer months which are positively lovely much outdoor camping hunting fishing golfing and sailing are done as a matter of fact alaska in general is rapidly becoming a tourist mecca i must add however that the anchorage negro does not take as large a part in these activities as the negro from the two military bases if youre culturally inclined you can listen to the beautiful music played by the anchorage symphony also since its inception over eight years ago the alaska festival of music has proven to be a huge drawing card for alaskans and tourists alike many prominent concert artists appear in anchorage all year round but especially during the music festival in june ive been told william warfield appeared here and recently carol stanford one negro woman mrs betty mcdonald although not a perma nent resident of anchorage plays a prominent part in anchorage cultural affairs mrs mcdonalds husband edward is stationed at elmendorf as a member of the united states air force besides a regular job of teaching at one of the junior high schools mrs mcdonald has also taught on a parttime basis at alaska methodist university but she is primarily known in anchorage for her lovely voice she is a member of the anchorage community chorus and has also appeared as guest soloist in several concerts the league of alaskan writers which held a successful writers conference last october has one negro member mrs delores watson the name brady jackson is wellknown in the anchorage community he is the retired holder of the alaska heavyweight title and onetime coach of the elmendorf football team but aside from his physical activities he is an actor and member of the elmendorf theater guild he not only acts and designs sets for the group but in may of this year he did such a fine job of directing the play a streetcar named desire that he won a billiken award for being the best director of the season he won an additional award for recognition of the individual who contributed most to the guild during the season his attractive wife is also a member of the guild one event that draws people from all over alaska and the south is the anchorage fur rendezvous held in february of each year professional buyers from all over come to bid on fur pelts but one sport that is the center of all eyes during the rendezvous is the sleddog racing the big alaskan huskys come dashing down the middle of fourth avenue pulling the sleds with their drivers egging them on to the finish line for the last two years snow has been so scarce that the sleddog racing has been in danger of being eliminated from the festivities it is during this time that you will see many eskimos in their native dress either just coming to the festival from their villages to sightsee or to participate in the entertainment there is plenty of eskimo dancing and blankettossing etc also at this time a fur rendezvous queen is chosen in an attractive negro girl miss grace hill was one of the candidates if i didnt mention homesteading in this article a very important subject would have been eliminated this is the word that has brought many people to alaska trying to find a better way of life it has brought joy to some but disillusionment and heartache to many naturally i wondered if there were many or any negro homesteaders in or around anchorage i learned promptly that there are several including the gracious and highly articulate negro woman lawyer mahala dickerson attorney dickerson seems to be making a success of her homestead but many many others colored and white have not been so fortunate or persevering first of all there are two types of homestead lands the free land being given away in alaska is the description of the land handled by the federal government the filing fee for acres of this land is only the requirements are that the homesteader live on his land at least seven months a year for years cultivate oneeighth of it and build a habitable house many people use trailers with the wheels taken off since clearing the land digging a well cultivating and planting a crop are tremendous jobs and costly ones in alaska abandoned homesteads are a common sight on the other hand state homesteads are offered for sale at public auction and up to acres can be purchased the entire amount can be paid at once or the land can be bought under contract at per cent down ard years to pay at per cent interest incidentally single men or single women or couples are eligible for both types of land there are no special requirements connected with the state lands as there are for the federal lands however credits are given by the state for developments on or in connection with the land for instance land cultivated gets per acre credit credit per feet of fencing etc aside from the high costs and backbreaking labor of getting a homestead established many other factors have to be taken into consideration most homesteads are so remote that gas electricity plumbing and the most common household conveniences are so rare that its almost as if they never existed but if youre the adventurous type if youre charmed and intrigued by the thought of pioneertype living then homesteading is the life for you in the heart of town on fourth avenue there are huge letters strung across the width of the avenue that say anchorage allamerica city most colored americans in anchorage who like high on the totempole racerelationswise say this is potentially true but one old colored man summed up the situation beautifully when he said why yes child this city is prettymuch allright for us colored folks right now but if we dont hurry up and git some more real smart ones who know how to git more and more into everything going on it aint goin to be that way long them others is movin in pretty fast you know an urgent warning to the bereaved by ruth hayward he postman knowing the family well hesitated to ring the door bell when he did he said gently mrs bonner itsits fordonnie c o d i can take it back you dont have to accept it you know with trembling hands the bereaved mother reached for the package addressed to her dead son donald bonner at the top left was stamped the name of the sender bible distributors of america almost in a whisper she said donnie must have ordered itbefore his accident such a good boy my donnie how much five dollars plus the c o d charges it all comes to the postman said but you really arent obliged to take it mrs bonner unheeding she hurried to get the money from her depleted purse counting small change until she had the right amount thank youoh thank you she said breathlessly receiving the package and holding it to her as if it contained the renewed life of the son she had buried less than two weeks before oh thank you and so another grieving family unwittingly added to the increasing wealth of that crudest group of swindlers the grave robbers and hearse chasers these heartless swindlers read the obituary columns all over the country in preparing their salesucker list first the name of the deceased then the nearest of kin preferably a wife mother or husband then so supplied by cohorts in various towns they specialize in mail order deals the articles of merchandise traded most often in this particular scheme are usually bibles religious trinkets jewelry goodluck charms photographic frames wallets pens etc the list is limited only by the tricky imagination of these merchantswho see the sorrowing as ready customers of anything addressed to the deceased about people die yearly so it is easy to figure the tremendous resource at the command of these sorrowswindlers these bunco artists specializing in commercializing sorrow are of many breeds and schemes some work nationally by mail but others are just as hard at work locally with moving persuasions for expensive trashyart tombstones or gravemarkers for the deceased cashing in on the grief and sometimeslateremorse of the grieving they find the bereaved anxious to make amends by spending far beyond their means for a memorial marker at this time it does not concern the grieving that the marker is highpriced who thinks of price at such a moment one only wants to do the right thing they are easily persuaded by these suave swindlers that this is the last thing they will ever be able to do for the loved ones now silent forever but grief can never be assuaged by spending money your late loved ones would not want you to be so victimized so remember this when and if you are approached by any of these or other nefarious schemes you cannot make up anything you cannot spend yourself into peace of mind or relief from any kind of remorse you can only fall into a trap that mocks deep grief a spokesman for the national association of the better business bureaus alert to the various schemes of these swindlers in sorrow offers this advice accept nothing c o d if you did not order it if it is sent to you on approval to be billed later you do not have to pay for it even if you do not return it if you are approached with merchandise purportedly ordered by the deceased take time to investigate know your company let those involved know you are making inquiries mention the better business bureau and postal inspector likely youll never hear from this particular company again letterheads are easy to print so dont be fooled by highsounding ones neither should you deal with post office box numbers unless an address is also given take time to be sure grief is an urgent persuader but it cannot be really helped by becoming a victim of trickery these heartless swindlers are extremely busy and clever be constantly on guard against old and new angles give dignity to the memory of your loved ones use the money you might give these tricksters in other ways that will make a lasting memorial this you know best how to do for you knew your loved one best in his or her name give to a favorite charity church school or individual help or scholarship it need not be a large bequest even a rose bush will bring lasting beauty and remembrance of a loved one death and grief come to all but it need not be commercialized by goulish opportunists when we can make it a lovely quiet memorial of remembrance eric was eric by margaret burroughs ne thing about him v eric was himself and r j all of us accepted him as a bit strange perhaps he was excep v jh f tional or eccentric well being an artist should explain away some of it eric was different but he was charming and so he was okay with us the nucleus of chicagos south side cultural intelligentsia tall gangling his clothes hung casually and sloppily on his long brown frame his chocolatehued roundish face was lighted by goggily big eyes which seemed in a permanent state of excitement erics type can be found in any racial or national group he was an artist from hair to fingertips a most creative person his contacts friendships and associations cut across all barriers of race creed and class eric was a member of the human race i first met him at the close of world war ii when he popped up at one of the meetings of our artists council at the community art center he was so talented and charming that has application for admittance was accepted without a dissenting vote we swallowed eric whole hog it was just as if he had always been around we learned later that he had come from out east some place and had relatives there but he never talked about this and we never asked him eric sought out the south side to make his stake he was talented interesting and charming and that was enough his lips laughed often to expose teeth which had grown in crooked on one side in conversation his words tumbled out one before the other was finished not only did he use his voice to communicate but his eyes nose shoulders arms hands and fingers and his entire unarticulated body especially was this so when he talked about art for hours he would rave and rant on realism in art abstractionism nonobjectivism or socialist realism after reading hayakawa it was semantics when he met a group of psychiatrists it was psychology and psychiatry when he became tight with a number of humanities majors from the university it was parrington and kafka it was difficult to keep up with erics various trends and directions shortly after we met him he invited several of us over to the basement on th and giles to see his work we were introduced to his wife pamela a slender olive skinned woman from the cool manner in which she greeted us i assumed that she had long since regretted the impetuosity that induced her to marry an artist eric flailed his arms before his easel like a windmill you see he explained pointing to the canvas i feel as if im going into another abstract period ya ya take for example these storefront churches that ive been painting he placed another canvas before us a stylized conception of what state street used to look like with its storefront churches and primitive designs that were intended to give the impression of stained glass the composition was broken up into small planes of color im experimenting with disintegration of form you see no cant really tell how far ill take it that remains to be seen ya ya who knows where ill go from here we were deeply awed by erics paintings the boldly covered canvases gave a dramatic picture of the black belt which few had the vision to see even the denizens who were penned in there through his eyes the tormented tenements the twisted streets and the storefront cathedrals became a colorful panorama which made our ghetto seem less squalid and hopeless he could really lay on color he was an artists artist and we all agreed to that months later eric announced that he was an expectant father which made it necessary for him to get a regular job this would be good for eric we thought perhaps it would settle him down with his tremendous talent if he could only become stabilized we felt that he could become a significant name in art not only in the midwest but in the country the baby came a girl and he carried photographs of the child as he referred to her in his wallet and pulled them out at the drop of a hat see he grinned see how much she looks like me she looks just like me isnt that amazing shortly thereafter we never knew whether he moved away from pamela or if he was invited to leave but eric announced that he had rented a studio garage in little bohemia near the art center at th and michigan avenue home life is not conducive to my best work he declared i couldnt cut it i have to get away i had to do something this domestic bit wife and kid to support and at the same time this art thing tearing at your guts and too that twobit job and a twobit boss all of it was beginning to bug me man its got me looking for the couch i had to get out he had a ball fixing the place up painting and nailing and hauling in furniture from the salvage bureau on th street one afternoon i stopped in and noticed that he had set up a red and white striped barbers pole right in the center of the room probably a prop for one of his paintings ya kate his eyes danced how do you like it the barber pole i mean yeah yeah i just had to have it needed something to brighten up the place gonna paint it over in bright colors got it from that little shop on th at two am the other morning had a hell of a time sawing it too erics head swung around on his neck like a calder mobile during this period eric painted furiously sometimes working on five or six canvases at a time and working all night having divested himself of his job he eeked out money for rent and food with saturday night parties he set up a makeshift bar in the kitchen put some candles in mogen david bottles improvised a cocktail table from an old door got a case of beer and a bottle of whiskey and he was in business those were quite some parties he had up there and they attracted a strange assortment of people those studio rent parties of erics were something else we all used to go to them we felt better helping eric out rather than the guy around the corner who was totally disinterested in art because things were dull over on the east side the university set found out about erics and began to come a sign near the entrance read check your inhibitions at the door the lights were so low in the room that it took some time after you entered to find out who else was in the room there was dancing and music but the most interesting part of these parties were the discussions though host bartender and cashier still eric had time to preside over the discussions as moderator the topics everything art music the dance the theatre psychiatry semantics world conditions civil_rights the jewish question the negro question sex capitalism and communism just to mention a few yes those were some goodtime saturday nights but all good things come to an end and erics parties abruptly ended when some of the parents of the university students lodged complaints against the place as being a disorderly house and too the police were shook about the black and white makeup of erics guests they just didnt seem to dig negro and whites socializing together after a while we noticed that erics paintings seemed to be going through a change he now con ceived his canvases in small planes juxtaposed to each other with heightened color when you looked at them you felt as if the paintings were exploding what im trying to show eric told us is disintegration of reality nothing is constant everything is in a state of change flux either integration or disintegration take the world today it is in a very confused state that is what i am trying to express the state of the world today he waved his arms wildly all of my background is gray dirty dull that reflects the demise of western civilization now take my brilliant reds and yellows ah they reflect the emergence on the world scene of the oriental philosophies zen buddhism and mohammedanism i confided to shep his best friendsay old man erics acting a bit strange these days have you noticed how crazy hes talking seems the same to me what makes you think this notice how he talks way out like and this new kick in painting seems like hes cracking to me so who isnt in this messed up society i dont know i dont know you know eric eric is eric eric will make it then eric informed us that his wife was suing him for a divorce he grinned poor kid she couldnt take it must have started bugging her too really cant blame her when the decree became final eric celebrated with a big party he dropped by my place to extend the invitation ha ha how ya kate ya just dropped in to invite you to a breaking out party breaking out of the bonds of matrimony ya how do you like that didnt have time to get out the engraved invitations from fields you know just think i gotta pay alimony and all this really makes me feel like a substantial citizen after having made a couple of shows at the institute eric decided to try and make it painting full time he sold at the outdoor art fairs and began to develop a following i managed to buy one of his paintings myself on time of course it is one of his city scapes with no people in it a period he went through after he came out of his nude with black net stockings phase it is hanging on my wall now and i could have sold it many times for triple the price i paid for it especially after eric left chicago and the dealers and collectors realized the genius of his work a few months later he announced that the atmosphere in chicago was stifling his creativity that he was thinking of retiring to mexico for a year to paint though he mentioned that he would be leaving in a week or two we paid it no mind after all on a previous occasion he had announced that he was going to spain and before that it was italy then one monday morning shep and i stopped by his studio to see how he had fared over the weekend knocking on the door we re ceived no answer a push on the door opened it eric would be back we thought probably had gone for a weekend in the country but why would he leave the door open with all of his paintings tools and personal possessions inside several days passed but eric did not return word came to us via the grapevine that he had taken off suddenly for mexico it seemed that a couple of kids from the university one jewish and the other gentile wished to marry since their parents were against it they decided to elope to mexico and eric joined the party as an extra driver the only fly in the ointment was that the couple were minors and eric was chronologically an adult thus making him liable for transporting these kids across state lines without their parents consent both sets of parents appealed to the police to intercept the fleeing lovers and their errant chauffeur we had a few anxious days as we prayed that they would make it to the border and across detectives visited all of us at our studios seeking to find out which route the fugitives had taken but in all honesty none of us knew a thing eric was a talker but he sure had sense enough to keep this bit of intelligence to himself we all breathed much easier when an artist returning from mexico reported that eric and the kids had made it he told us that the two young people had married and become reconciled with their families that eric had rented a place in ajijic set one bottle of tequila on the shelf and had gone into business we didnt hear any more from eric for almost a year nor did his wife and child there was a mad scramble for his paintings another artist moved into his studio and held saturday night parties too but it wasnt the same yes erics sudden departure left a vacuum in our cultural set when we wondered would we ever see the likes of him again that crazy nutty unpredicable wonderful unscrupulous fellow one could not easily forget him at least i could not it was a year or so later on a trip to mexico that my husband and i decided to look up our old friend eric we heard that he had because of town pressure moved from ajijic to taxco we had no known address for him but off we went to taxco with the hope that just coincidentally we might find him coincidentally we did arriving in the town square we asked a small boy if he could direct us to senor eric el negro at first the child knew nothing but after we pressed a peso into his palm his memory perked up so senores you look for el senor negro meester eric i tell you you must sit in the club there and wait i will tell him you are looking for him he will come we made ourselves comfortable with a couple of tequilas con sangre and waited an hour passed and no eric my husband and i looked at each other making and accepting a mutual bet that he would or would not appear my husband was the doubter after another half hour had passed he glanced at his watch triumphantly so you got us into this off on a wild goose chase looking for eric he said eric is probably in veracruz or acapulco some place maybe even in jail he wasnt going to show i resigned myself to having to pay the bill then suddenly we heard that high nervous laugh floating in the door hi there folks welcome to sunny mexico ya ya as usual his words tumbled one over the other for his mind raced faster than the words could come out when did youse get to town how long you gonna stay hows everybody back in good ole chi the art center still open the old gang still around sitting down with us he joined in the elbow bending eric had not changed much but wee lines around his eyes and a puffiness beneath them indicated that things were not going as cheerfully as he indicated ya ya me im doing just fine just fine doing a lot of painting started in wood sculpture experimenting with collages also positive and negative space all the time he was talking he was popping up and down running to the door and looking out up the hill we questioned him with our eyes ha ha you can tell them back home that i havent changed a bit still up to my old tricks ya ya theres a little schoolteacher from texas up there red head sent word she wants me to paint her portrait ya ive got quite a clientele returning to the table he said say kate you and bill have another tequila and look dont pay ill take care of the bill im going up the hill and ill be back in fifteen minutes ya he nodded to the waiter mis amigos give them anything they want ill pay when i come back then ill take you guys to dinner si senor eric si the waiter smiled warmly at him erics charm had worked its wonders on the people of taxco too eric felt for his pocket he turned back to us just my luck to have left my wallet in my other suit and ive got to pick up a package at the post office look bill let me hold ten until i get back sure thing eric my husband handed him a bill why it seemed just like old times again i thought we relaxed and sipped on a third pair of tequilas con sangre it was certainly good to see eric again he was a long way from th and michigan avenue but he was still eric when he came back down the hill we would tell him that we had seen his little daughter and that she was growing up quite nicely and still looked a great deal like him and that his exwife pamela had married again or perhaps he knew all that ah but it was good to see him again my husband and i reflected on the delicious mexican dinner we would have with eric later we would sit and recall old times over some of the good mexican beer it would be very nice then we would take the midnight bus back to mexico city an hour and a half passed and eric did not return i looked at my husband oh eric will be coming any minute now he said lets have another tequila the waiter brought the drinks and placed the bill before us he was apologetic i dont know he said perhaps el senor eric will not come back today my son tells me that senor eric is this minute riding on the bus to cuernavaca he saw him with his own eyes and with him was a pretty senorita with red hair so i hope you do not mind paying the bill of course we did not mind paying the bill all fifty pesos of it back in mexico city we thought oh well one couldnt really be angry with eric he had such a darn charming way of doing you in ordinarily one would think that we had had enough of eric he certainly had a part of us but curiosity persisted and we always perked up when the grapevine brought some word of erics activities back to chicago we heard that he had married again a redhead that he had been lodged for safekeeping against an irate husband in a local jail that his zany unpredictable action had caused such a strain on the peaceful and friendly relations existing between the united states and mexico that the authorities decided the best method of keeping the peace would be to deliver eric back to the land of his birth which they did pronto eric didnt care to go to texas and california couldnt help itself so the next thing we heard was that he had set up a studio in market street in the bay city with his wife and small boy child the story should perhaps end here with me telling you that eric settled down to family life and responsibility carving a niche of respectability for himself in the san francisco art colony but no the following summer i visited san francisco and having heard that eric was there i decided to look him up remembering that after all he had been a very charming fellow back home and talented it would be interesting to see what he was doing and what had happened to his painting had he progressed or regressed in that disintegration of reality direction he was experiencing when he left chicago it would be interesting to know despite his leaving us high and dry in taxco i remembered him kindly eric was eric sure ruthless he was and irresponsible and unscrupulous but one thing he was charming i inquired and was given an address for him on market street shortly after arriving in town i sauntered out to look up eric finding no one at home i left a note on his door with my name and phone number but received no response i thought our old friend eric must have gone to spain because back in chicago he was always talking about going to spain to live and paint then one afternoon shortly before i was to return home i received a call from a friend of erics youre trying to find eric yes im an old friend of his from chicago is eric all right hes fine just been out of circulation for a few weeks out of circulation yes incarcerated well in custody really you want to see him yes oh yes be down to the county court house tomorrow at theres a sanity trial eric versus the city of san francisco i wasnt too much surprised even back in chicago we had regarded eric as being a little bit nuts eric must have come into conflict with the existing society poor boy but he was a good old friend and he had been charming and that far from home i felt he needed a friend so i presented myself at the courthouse the next morning i wished to be helpful and offered my services to his attorney so youre an old friend of erics from chicago thats good perhaps you can be helpful and tell us what he was like when you knew him oh ill be glad to do anything i can to help eric well be seated and i may call you to answer a few questions whats it all about i asked eric was doing all right here for the past year painting and selling enough of his work to take care of his wife and child then about six months ago his wife died leaving him with the boy age two it seemed that his wifes death shook him unbalanced him we think and he started withdrawing into himself acting irrational he was taken into custody on charges of neglecting the child allowing the boy to run wild in the street did nothing but sit looking out of the window on market street heard voices through the wall received messages over the radio that sort of thing the attorney told me further that in defiance of psychiatric recommendations that he sign himself into a mental hospital for treatment eric insisted on going through a jury trial as a test of his sanity the city acting in behalf of erics minor child charged that he was deranged mentally and morally unfit to be responsible for the boy erics attorney claimed that his client was not deranged or erratic but merely creative and artistic and that given a job or a patron he would be quite capable of discharging his responsibilities the trial began when eric saw me he twisted around and waved all the time winking his goggily eyes he smiled showing those crooked teeth and seemed totally unaware of the fact that this was serious business that his sanity was being tested he was the star of this show and was enjoying it immensely the trial proceeded with witnesses being called pro and con the judge was a gentleman of eighty years who clung tightly to a hearing aid the jury staid and respectable people included one japaneseamerican if things followed as they usually did i thought eric with his nutbrown skin wouldnt have a chance my name was called and nervously i took the stand i wasnt too certain however of my testimony in favor of his sanity as i sat down in the witness chair i reconciled my doubts with the thought that any eccentricities in his behavior could be equated with his creativeness artists were different otherwise how could they be artists the attorney for the defense leveled a number of questions at me the answers establishing that eric was an artist of recognized talent when he was back in chicago i told of the shows he had made at the institute and the prizes he had won at the atlanta annual i named a number of prominent midwest collections in which he was included i was proud that i had given eric a good sendoff in this respect erics attorney took a seat and now the attorney for the prosecution stood before me he brought out the fact that was the only person in the courtroom who knew the accused before he came to california is it true that you were an associate of the defendant when he lived in chicago five years ago yes sir tell me when you knew the defendant in chicago did you ever hear him speak of hearing voices through the walls of his studio no sir when you knew the defendant back in chicago did you have any evidence that he received messages through listening to the radio no sir back in chicago other than the eccentricities that go with being an artist did the defendant act in any manner that would lead you to conclude that he was deranged no sir thank you no further questions as i took my seat behind the bar i avoided looking at eric perhaps my testimony had not helped him at all the trial went on the case was rested the jury recessed having to catch an evening train i was not able to return to the afternoon session to find out the outcome i waved eric goodbye ya kate he called to me while being shushed by a bailiff everything gonna be all right tell everybody back in chi that im okay okay i hurriedly gave my address to one of his friends who promised to write me the outcome three days later back home i received a wire re eric jury hung new trial next month certainly i rejoiced ah that eric a couple of months later a letter from a friend of erics stating that he had been acquitted and had gone voluntarily into a veterans hospital for a rest the child had been placed in a foster home until such time as eric established himself i dont know whether he ever did erics painting of the disintegrating city scape still hangs on my wall the dealers have combed chicago for his paintings especially since a prominent art critic recalling erics brilliant faceted canvases mentioned that eric was a forerunner of the abstract expressionist movement in the midwest now everyone here who owns a painting by him is husbanding it closely including me i cant take you further we have come to the end of this story except for one last note some weeks ago on a return trip to the west coast i asked an exchicagoan how about our friend eric these days what is he doing the kid did he ever get him back nope never did doesnt paint anymore either just sits day and night in one coffee house or other doesnt work you know how charming eric was still is hes built up a coterie of disciples who keep him sheltered clothed and fed hes one of the revered leaders of the beats out this way i was sentimental for a moment he was a zany guy but nice maybe i should try and find him dont cautioned my friend i took his advice and so i cant tell you more about eric but really havent i told you enough already her middle name is spunk by frances hill herever she goes in w idlewild upper

area those were the days of a dollar down a dollar a week mrs wilson grins amused now at her own naivete but she was young and she was naive and she fell in love with the thick oak groves and the many hidden lakes she particularly loved one very cold lake cold enough for rainbow trout we didnt get back until upon return the wilsons bought acres surrounding the lake and lela promptly named it paradise then the couple had to make money to support the dream rental cottages was one answer i laid floors until i had corns on my knees lela laughs now selling real estate was another they had acquired as fast as they could acres but we had to have telephones recalls lela to sell lots to city people and electricity the wilsons brought in a private telephone line from nirvana ten miles distant boy what a job she says then we had to keep it up and make repairs i never want to do that again later a public phone company took it over they petitioned for electricity and were quoted an impossible sum so i wrote to governor green michigans governor then lela continues and in we got it free idlewild now has street lights community maintained by automobiles were changing american life

congregation of and summed up the american way of life i have a dream and the country shook with the roar of affirmation from the answering crowd the generation of dreamers from mobile from jackson from danville from savannah gathered in the greatest conclave ever answered yes yes oh god yes and went home united in a common cause yes but home where to the south only there seems to be few dreamers of the kind dr_king represents north of the mason dixon line that is the dreamer who uses his air castle as a blueprint the dreamer whose morning coffee does not act as a chaser to his subconscious visions of manhood freedom and equality was the march on washington primarily a southern affair were the vast majority of northerners party crashers as so many recent newspaper articles attest most attempts to effectively channel the northern dream end in failure or moderate success which is of course the same thing the naacp in boston recently engaged in a power struggle with the boston school committee as to whether the predominance of negro pupils in schools in a predominantly negro community was due to de facto segregation as the naacp would have it or racial imbalance as the bsc termed it in a preliminary municipal election the school committee won a vote of confidence from the city just who bearsor should bear the responsibility for the northern dream or lack thereof the entire community of course but particularly the recent college graduate it seems to me the negro college graduate who comes or returnsnorth would be expected to begin almost at once to transform his collegiate dreams into reality his bold reforms as set forth in his final sociology papers his courage in leading southern sitins his hardhitting editorials in the college newspaper and espe dally his prophetic valedictoryall these point to the birth of a great leader an articulate spokesman for his people in the northern city of his choice what happens he moves directly into the ghetto without so much as stopping to explore the availability of decent housing areas begins teaching what else in one of the citys blighted areas soon buys a magnificent automobile relapses into the monosyllabic colloquial speech which identifies him as in and disappears into the group his bookcase becomes a record rack his desk a whisky cabinet or he comes to the northern metropolis gets another degree or two begins teaching what else makes a good marriage moves into the most expensive section of the ghetto and disappears entirely much of this comes about as a result of our leaders willingness to take discrimination and segregation for granted how can he do otherwise short of avoiding contact with his people upon his arrival he is met by the sad disillusioned host of the unprepared not only the unskilled and therefore jobless but those who unfortunately have prepared themselves for the wrong professions social worker teacher to name two of the most prevalent who have a pitiful tale to tell he listens dons sackcloth and ashes and sits with them waiting what else is there for him to do equality runs in a vicious circle good housing comes about as a result of good jobs which come about as a result of proper schooling and adequate preparation our dreamer must have from the beginning the foresight to pursue an academic discipline which will lead directly to a moneymaking career real

rely by julia siebel butor is a v leader among the new ajlvjl y u n g writers in france his experimental novels have been translated into english and are read with interest both here and abroad he has traveled and studied in the u s and now in mobile simon and schuster has arranged his knowledge observations and opinions of us in an intricate pattern designed in itself to express something of the restlessness of the country for fifty hours beginning on a summer midnight his mobile wheels like a hawk over the fifty states in alphabetical order noting significant and not always beautiful bits of the american scene each hour is a kind of chapter from a few words to several pages long the first hour being simply pitch dark in cordova alabama the deep south like the opening phrase of a symphony these four notes of color time place name and historical area grow and proliferate throughout the book to form its basic structure color comes to include observed scraps and pieces of our preoccupation with colors of rugs clothes alarm clocks ice cream cars but chiefly it becomes awareness of race black man white man indian time becomes not only hours and time zones but speed and direetion the accelerating motion of our travel here and abroad how much longer the planes that leave for paris the ships that come from singapore taxi we took the wrong road we have to go back place names echo and reecho the european americans nostalgia for europe from which poverty had driven them or the names commemorate dead indians indians indian places buffalo historical areas yield natural landscapes seascapes birds plants of this continent they also yield paragraphs of the familiar documents both sacred and profane of our history and of our contemporary life sometimes in his own words or through dream sequences during the wheeling night hours but chiefly by means of elements of these our own familiar documents arranged in strange juxtapositions butor reveals his strong often savage insights for example he juxtaposes excerpts from william penns sacred peace treaty with the delawares a report of the pennsylvania militia eliminating a delaware village which had accepted christianity a history of the trappist monastery with ads for their preserves testimony from a salem witch trial and testimony of a seneca indian preaching a new kind of christian salvation through the peyotl cult the implication is inevitable that christianity was betrayed here by christians during the second midnight over washington d c a not unintentional concurrence the hawkeyed observer suggests that the murder of lincoln in the capital city has assumed the qualities of myth because it is a stunning representation of that obscure and laboriously forgotten primordial murder of red man by white man upon which every city in the nation is founded another clashing set of quotations includes jeffersons all men are created equal his rationalization of slavery the romans had it and proof of negro inferiority his pompous architectural preference for imitation greek and roman temples louis sullivans passion for architectural honesty betrayed by the chicago worlds fair in and on to

why arent you smiling the planes that leave for antwerp porter the distance between our dream of democracy and the historic facts of slavery and our elimination of the indian has become the schism between the fantasies of our entertainmentconsumeradvertising dream life and the hot reality of the racial predicament which confronts us today in one sequence a kind of subconscious tirade is addressed to northern liberals by a southerner defending segregation only the south knows the depth of the negros resentment his potential strength and that the whole american way of life must crumble when the negro inevitably rises you have beaten us northerners we who were your ramparts as we were already beaten by the negro but when the negroes rise up then we too will have that moment of vengeance they have taught us to expect and closing our eyes we will grin the last hour of butors mobile is midnight in eden wyoming and the last place name is buffalo butors picture of the u s coincides too closely with those of such native americans as historian lerone bennett jr and observers james howard griffin and james baldwin to be lightly dismissed as a foreigners warped view a new york reviewer quoted on the dust jacket calls mobile as familiar as our roadsides and far funnier there is the brutal humor of a rough brotherly affection through some passages and theres bitter satire beyond that the book is about as familiar and funny as murder and that reviewer like another who condemns it as a confused inventory of smells tastes and statistics simply demonstrates the white americans dangerous blindness to our national situation that butor is writing about the last quarter of the book drags a little and butors observations are not all beyond challenge since he was here the negro people have indeed begun to rise and not all white americans have panicked away into freedomland but for anyone honestly concerned with building here and now finally and in fact a home

governments have signed this charter the o f united africa by kwame nkrumah meaning of the charter the charter of african unity must be regarded as the last but one step on the road to a continental union the exploiters of africa have grasped its implications they realize that we are out to make ourselves masters in our own house and to drive out relentlessly from the length and breadth of our continent those forces which batten upon us and keep us in political and economic subjection salaam in tanganyika this committee will be responsible for regulating the assistance from african states and for managing the special fund which is being created by contributions from all the independent african governments this means that we must accept as our primary task the extension of independence to all territories of africa apart from the sense of oneness and unity which impels us to go to the aid of our suffering compatriots in angola mozambique southern rhodesia south africa and other parts of africa still under colonial rule we know that none of the independent african states is safe so long as a single colonial ruler remains on african soil freedom fighters will take renewed hope and determination from the knowledge that their struggle is identified with the continued independence of the existing african states and is to be directed within a total strategy no longer will these freedom fighters who have been in the vanguard of the african revolution and the colonial liberation movement feel isolated from the mainstream of african independence and unity i am indeed happy that the goal which we set ourselves at our independence has been brought nearer we shall strive for it now not alone but with our brothers from all the independent african states the problem of rhodesia let us make our position perfectly clear on this vital issue in the past britain by force of arms imposed upon the people of southern rhodesia or to give it its natural indigenous name zambia an alien government designed to deprive the people of zambia of their lands and their mineral wealth britain was a party to the establishment of a government composed exclusively of minority settlers who had contrary to all conceptions of justice possessed themselves of the lands and resources of the inhabitants this settler government of southern rhodesia is now demanding that it should be granted independence in other words it is inviting the british government to set up a second south africa in the heart of our continent without taking into account the wishes of the majority of the people in that territory no african state could in any way accept such a travesty of morality justice and international law nor would we accept the undemocratic racialist counter proposals which the british government is reported to have made to the settler southern rhodesian government any government that is formed in southern rhodesia without the consent of the majority of its people will be unacceptable not only would we refuse to acknowledge any such government we shall oppose its entry into the commonwealth and into the united nations our recognition will only go to a government which in our view is fully representative of the people of zambia that is a government based upon universal adult suffrage employing the principle of one man one vote i cannot believe that any british government could commit the supreme folly and blunder of setting up at this stage of our african struggle for independence and unity a second south africa whose examples of the appalling evils of apartheid and minority rule are so glaringly manifested against the african population every single day i have left the british government in no doubt about the stand we are prepared to take against the setting up of an unpopular minority independent government of southern rhodesia this is a crucial and decisive moment in the history of southern africa the attainment of political freedom by the people of southern rhodesia would not only mean the setting up of a free and indigenous zambian state it would bring a message of hope and encouragement to african peoples elsewhere in southern africa who are denied any right to control their own affairs but zambia will in any event become free in truth of course the situation in southern rhodesia could have been solved as has been the kenya situation but for one factorthe proximity of southern rhodesia to south africa indeed the southern rhodesian settlers are nothing more than pawns in the game of chess now being played by the great powers over south africa the independence of the people of southern rhodesia is not in reality being considered on its merits it is considered only in relation to the south african situation south africa is probably the biggest impediment to the liberation and unity of the african continent and it is a question which we must face squarely and realistically the need for strength i am not unmindful of the grave difficulties which face some of us lack of capital economic weakness and political instability are conditions that have been responsible for the acceptance of economic and military dependence upon former colonial powers in some instances such as is obtained not only for development but even for meeting normal recurrent budgetary expenses it is an act of high courage on the part of sister states thus boldly to have set their hand to a policy of nonalignment which can hardly be in keeping with the policy of those on whom unhappily they find themselves dependent yet it is these states particularly that should find the greatest advantage in developing our african unity into a firmly welded concert of nations as a real political force with political direction under a central authority within which they can shed their economic and military dependence and regain their dignity proposals of aid need to be examined with care most of all we must beware of any kind of military help for it can so easily place us in the hands of foreign powers and make them in effect the arbiters of our fate apart from drawing us into their orbit they become intimately familiar with details of our defense structure and its strength they can even become the designers of our defense structure and place us completely at their mercy aid of this kind even where ostensibly free can be most dangerous costly in its consequences for it creates pockets of coldwar presence on the african continent and lets in the neocolonialists with danger not only to the harbouring country but to its neighbors to whom it poses an open threat above all it creates frictions and disputes that will disturb the unity upon which we have embarked and to which i am convinced all of us are sincerely dedicated that is why it is so urgent for us to get together within a centralized framework that will give shape and purpose to the agreements which we made at addis ababa coordination of our political and diplomatic policies harmonization of our economic educational and cultural activities collaboration in health sanitation and nutritional matters coordination in scientific and technical fields cooperation for defense and security will go their dilatory pace unless the organization of african unity is pivoted upon a centralized authority capable of giving effective political direction to these aims political and diplomatic cooperation cannot function in a void it needs some sort of a political constitution to direct it economic development in separate states is ineffective but with our combined resources governed by an overall plan we can make africa great prosperous and progressive above all the full development of all our countries needs the most economic exploitation and husbanding of our natural and human resources this is possible only on a continental scale if we are to extract the greatest advantage from the latest industrial and administrative techniques as applied to our extensive land mass and population the evil of racism everywhere equally in striving for african freedom and unity we cannot be indifferent to events in other parts of the globe which can vitally affect the progress which we make towards our goal it is in this spirit that we have concerned ourselves about such grave international issues as the sinoindian border dispute and the cuban situation in doing so we were not only serving the cause of world peace which is of vital importance to us we were serving the cause of african liberation and unity as well i believe that the forces now pressing for freedom and unity in africa will be strong enough to overcome any external obstacle yet we must not blind ourselves to the fact that one of the great causes of african disunity and of the maintenance of racialist and colonialist regimes on african soil is the disagreement and hostility which at present exists between the great powers imperialism and the socalled white supremacy are the basic factors of instability in africa and one of the contributory causes of world tention secondly unless the situation in south africa improves radically so as to afford opportunities for the majority of the citizens of that state to express their will in a government of their own country this could be a theatre for a world conflict racial oppression and injustice in any form cannot be condoned or ignored racialism is a blot on the conscience of mankind and the sooner it is removed the greater the prospects of world peace will be it is in the same context that one has to consider the problem of racial discrimination in the united states although the efforts now being made by the government of the united states to bring about a a solution to this longstanding problem in america are appreciated it must be stated that nothing except a bold and revolutionary assault on this moral obloquy and this grave crisis of racial confidence in the united states can bring about a speedy solution the afroamerican has been taught to appreciate the dignity of the individual living as he does in one of the most technically advanced countries of our time and yet at the same time he is being denied what is his essential and inalienable right the afroamerican did not choose to go to the new world he was dragged into america to help establish the economy of that country this he has done with great credit distinguishing himself in all fields of human endeavor in music law diplomacy art science and education he has achieved great distinction for america the united states has therefore a moral duty to accept the essential humanity of the afroamerican time is of the essence this at once raises the matter of speed and urgency this is everything in our march we must in africa crowd into a generation that experience and achievements attained through centuries of trial and error by the older nations of the world we do not wish to see africa set on a course in which her nations grow indifferent separate and competing directions until they develop into a confused and disorderly economic tangle of sixes and sevens because europe has become the victim of such economic circumstances that is surely no reason why africa should follow a similar course those who set the example of europe as an illustration for the need to develop step by step in africa do not seem to appreciate that africa need not begin by imitating the mistakes of europe after all what use is the experience of human progress if we who study its course fail to learn from its errors and muddles as i said at addis ababa this world is no longer moving on camels and donkeys speed has become a new potent factor in the progress of the world the progress of the modern man like the agile kangaroo leaps and jumps more than that we have to remove the gap between those nations and ourselves if we are to emerge from the grip of the economic imperialism that will retard us the longer it remains a master or even a part of our economy we have to keep in mind however that the gap is not a static one but that it grows as modern technology improves and its productive capacities and output potentials increase thus the gap can widen seriously and new dangers threaten us unless we hasten forward at a much accelerated speed consciousness of the time element among the leaders of independent africa was clearly revealed in the course of our deliberations at addis ababa this awareness enabled us to examine our problems with a striking sense of urgency it was responsible for the speed with which we were able to adopt a charter of unity for africa why then cannot we observe the same consciousness of time and the same sense of urgency in pushing forward our unity into a form that will give it direction and authority so that we can speedup our common development and advancement in the horizon of africas future i see clearly the bright dawn of a union government the birth of a great nation which is no longer the dream of a new utopia africa the sleeping giant is now awake and is coming into her very own black muslims by calvin c hernton hen it comes to that w y zone of our lives where black meets white the oa north has aiways imagined himself as some kind of eternal liberal primarily this has two causes first the fact that the union army won the civil war provides white northerners with a readymade feeling of historical benevolence on the racial front second there is always the south at which northerners can point a castigating finger and swell their chests with pride that race relations in the north are much better than in the south care packages are sent southward to negroes who are being starved and maimed there are freedom rides sympathetic demonstrations fund raising campaigns and nonviolent antisegregation walks these things have inspired white liberals in the north with the illusion that negroes especially those above the masondixon ought to love themor at least appreciate them this is so true that white people all over the north are alarmed and disturbed about the increasing numbers of negroes who are turning their backs on white liberals and casting their lots with such groups as the black muslims the black nationalists and others of similar orientation there is fear in the air no negro can make a speech anywhere now without some white person asking are you a black muslimor what do you think about black muslims for the last several months this is all i have heard from every white person who conceived ot himself as a liberal and like most negroes i have lied or half lied i have given the kind of replies i know white liberals prererred to hear but now i have made up my mind to speak the truth as i see it or to use an ethnic expression i am going to tell it like it isnot only for whites but for negroes as well first of all racial conditions in the north are far from what white liberals have deluded themselves into thinking they are tnere is no need to dwell on the vast amount of public and private jim crow dis crimination and bigotry still being practiced against the northern negro nor can we speak appreciatively of the rate at which race relations are progressingafter all we have had three hundred years now again with the possible i say possible exception of manhattan and one or two other northern communities the negro must consult a map to make certain he is up north in the overwhelming majority of caseshousing education employment civil_rightsbeing a negro in the north has been little better than being a nigger in the south what is more in the north much of the inhumanity toward the negro or unfair treatment is less tangible than in the south it is legally invisible and almost impossible to prove for instance i was recently interviewed for a job by the director of a multimillion dollar social agency in new york city the director found nothing wrong with my qualifications yet as i sat there something seemed to be troubling him finally and quite calmly he informed me that if i were hired i would be the first negro to occupy a semiadministrative position in his agency i would be as he put it the jackie robinson of his agency he wondered if i could command the respect of those white who would be under me he especially emphasized the fact that would have to represent his agency to other institutions and business firms he was a nice man i sat there quietly smiling at him as i had seen sidney poitier do in a movie i did not get the position someone better qualified got it he happened to be white the purpose of the agency incidentally is to rehabilitate negro and puerto rican teenagers in an area where eightyfive per cent of the population consists of these two groups i have found that not only are there no negroes or puerto ricans in administrative positions in that agency but that the entire board of directors and trustees are all white too often the white northern liberal views the inhumanity toward the american negro as a socialwork problem a problem for individual dogooders and not one which requires the reorganization of the total american social structure when i say reorganization i mean redistribution of economic political and military power in such a fashion that the negro himself will be in a position to make sure that no one public or private can get away with treating him less than a man the fact is the northern white man liberal though he prides himself is not very different from his southern kinsmen the difference lies in the degree of selfdeceit unlike his southern brother the negro in the north no longer believes in the white liberal he no longer trusts him in the south where conditions are so terribly oppressive a white man can be a liberal by merely saying he is for voter registration or school integration on a token level but in the north where the more brutal and obvious forms of inhumanity toward the negro are passing away the wouldbe white liberal finds it increasingly difficult to be a liberal for that means doing something about the final remnants of jim crow doing something about the more subtle psychological and difficulttoprove modes of prejudice all of which the northern white man seems unwilling or unable to eradicate it is because of this that more and more northern negroes are being driven i say driven to abandon the white liberal for it is clear the liberal in the north is no longer a liberal but a hyprocrite at best he is a victim of seemingly an insurmountable selfdeceit to say the least this is what i felt as i listened to the director of that agency who was a jew and i am certain thought of himself as a white liberal a friend of negroes upon innumerable occasions and incidents this is what most negroes feel indeed every american black man at least once in his life has been seized by a passion of intense animosity for the white man if there were any such thing as justifiable hatred the negros hatred for the caucasian race could very well fit this category the rise of the black muslims and other such groups has grown out of the negros impatience with the white liberal and the not too invalid opinion that white men in general never intend to treator are actually incapable of treating the negro as an equal and the liberals are right as long as they maintain their present position on race their fear of northern negroes is not without grounds for like all modern negroes the black muslims mean business on the other hand white liberals are wrong about many other things for instance the black muslims and here i mean the muslim organization proper is not a movement founded solely on racial hatred and violence there is instead much hatred and malice toward the white man and plain insanity smoldering in the minds of northern negroes and i am coming to this but for now let us try to see the saner side or at least let us be fair something we have found impossible to be in the past when a negro asserts that by and large the white man is an untrustworthy hypocritical devil he is stating more of a fact than a lie he can prove his assertions by statistics history his own objective experiences and by what is going on this very minute not only in the south but all over the united states negroes who say they are superior to white people are not all saying so on the basis of a reverse racism but often because they feel they are more willing to be humane loving and democratic than the white man has proved himself to be contrary to what many whites think few muslims hate white people as a passion of the ego racism any style is based on lies myths stereotypes fear and guilt the black muslim movement is one expression of an historical necessity for the salvation of the black man in america just as zionism was a movement designed to deliver the jews out of bondage and alienation the white liberal should understand this if under prolonged trial and tribulation the jews could set themselves up as gods chosen nation is it so incomprehensible that god or allah has now after nearly four centuries of oppression selected the negroes as his chosen people what we should further understand is that the whole racial situation in america is itself absurd and insane the negro problem is a product of this situation let loose among the mighty impersonal forces of urban life yet regimented into fetid ghettoes like harlem and south side chicago the northern negro especially is prey to all kinds of doctrines and movements this is why the anger of the negroes has its riotlike momentum in the most advanced northern cities while the southern negro must fight like hell for the bare minimum of freedom the northern negro constitutes what might be called the liberated oppressed had the white man in the north been aware of what these negroes were feeling all along he could have predicted a movement such as the black muslims therefore had they been willing they could have prevented or at least mitigated it but it is too late for that now the american white man has always ignored the negros feelings until it was too late the point now is that the muslim movement is a mass movement in all mass movements there are ingredients that appeal to or produce psychopathic individuals if a movement cult religion or what have you is to be more than a hate group or a gang to perpetrate violence then other ingredients must be incorporated that will counterbalance or neutralize those that induce or appeal to psychopathy to some extent it is the discipline and the religious and intellectual training studying islam and arabic for instance which welds the black muslims into a primary collective energizes the individual muslim with a missionary zeal and gives him a sense of dignity and purpose on the other hand there are many negroes who have latched onto only the raw emotional aspects of the muslim doctrine and now we arrive at the point where it becomes hazardous for me to be honest but i shall try increasing numbers of negroes are being drawn from the ranks of the young avant garde generation who are not actually members of the black muslims but who are nevertheless adopting a psuedomuslim orientation toward the white man they are pseudomuslims because for one thing they have not truly abandoned the white mans values their hatred for whites is really a mixture of selfhatred and envy of the white man their claim to racial superiorty is an inverse expression of their feeling of racial and personal deficiency such negroes are afflicted with what i call the syndrome of blacknessthey are in turmoil with themselves they actually feel inferior because of their color alone and want to become a part of integrated or assimilated into the white world thereby losing their inferiority the attempt to assimilate however is constantly frustrated by the white mans bigotry insincerity and his deep psychological block against negroes the negro is thrown back upon himself his selfesteem is bankrupted racial rage corrodes his psyche the white man mirrors his alter image but the white man denies him the negro therefore hates not only himself but the white man as well he talks and behaves like a schizophrenic preaching black supremacy and hatred of whites on the one hand on the other hand haunting integrated circles bars coffee houses and parties smiling into white faces and incessantly trying to woo the white woman this is the negro you should fear most he is dangerous he wants to eat his color and have it too he has come to an impasse with himself he is the worst kind of racist hating both races he wants to be white and black at once one kind of racism is equally as insane as another i do not wish to exchange one lie one myth for another no matter how functional it may be if the mind of the white southern racist is a sick mind it is inescapable that the mind of the black northern racist is equally dis eased the psuedomuslim oriented negroes in the north are too often selfstyled hipsters hangerson with little talent or any real qualities by which they can trust themselves to rise in the world they need a bandwagon on which to ride their color becomes that bandwagon at the core of their problem is the psychology of the tough criminal with a chip on his shoulder they do not owe the world anything they think the world owes them everything like the white southern racists they are forever on guard to exploit and intimidate the white man especially the most honest sincere liberal types beware particularly is this true when it comes to the white woman i have witnessed time after time the deliberate unprovoked intimidation of many of my friends by such negroes simply and only because they were white it is a form of racial blackmail practiced on the liberal especially the neophyte liberal there is a strange kind of sadism involved for not only is it masochistic it is selfintimidation also i sat in a bar known for its mixed clientele several negroes were at my table and two white persons the negroes dominated the con versation everything they said for at least an hour smacked at how immoral bigoted and inhumane every white man in america is r they hated the naacp it was run by white people they hated core also run by whites they hated kennedy and stevenson and mrs roosevelt they found ways of putting white people down they had never heard of or seen meanwhile all africans were great and no white jazz musician was as good as a black jazz musician all the time their eyes were deliberately fixed upon the two whites who very uncomfortably remained at the table i sat quietly and watched them a sickness rose up in me almost everything they said was inaccurate even though one had a college degree and all of them had studied something they were actually illiterate many northern negroes are racial hypochondriacs they are obsessed with racial suffering both real and fantasied they deliberately provoke situations where they can be hurt their aggression is false they are raceniks gaudy hitchhikers trying to steal a ride to a place they do not want to go of course it is not altogether their fault but this is not the question the fact is these negroes are sick people and it is time they faced up to their illness and made a positive attempt at doing something about it on the other hand and this must come hard the fear that northern liberals feel because of the rise of black muslims is valid but only half valid white liberals are guilty themselves their anxiety represents their guilt moreover the other half the valid half of their fear is misplaced consider few negroes can ever become black muslims or black anythings for most of them are hooked so to speak on american values white values their identity can never be anything other than american whatever that may be no amount of energy spent on embezzling an identity such as wearing the hair au natural and calling oneself afroamerican can actually make the negro african definitely american standards of beauty and esthetics will undergo changes under the impact of african influences but changing ones style of dress or switching labels will not erase the facts of the negros life experiences in this country upon which the mystique of his identity hangs it can only hide such facts most negroes look the way they look speak walk and think they way they do because of what has happened to them in america and for no other reason and what does all of this mean for white liberals it means they should not fear the swelling ranks of muslims and muslimlike movements but fear the cause of these movements which is nothing more than the white mans bad faith ignorance and selfdeceit in all matters dealing with race relations in the north because of the white liberals somnolence and recalcitrance in the face of the mood of the negro race relations in the north are going to get worse before they become better what happened in harlem and elsewhere on the various nights of the birmingham rallies is omen for our times the negros anger at the milkwarm nonviolent shadowboxing of northern liberals will flare up boldly with increasing frequency and intensity all over the north it will spread west but by doing everything possible even at the risk of painful selfupheaval to immediately bring about equality and respect for the negro as a human being and a citizen the white liberal can avoid much psychological agony and violence goodbye america by jane rogers clay ou are my country i v am yours you have jl made me have created me out of yourself but you do not want me you have belittled and degraded me until i have become little and degraded

here for a long time probably longer than you the united states of america have been here yourself when i was born i had no concept of color it did not take me long to acquire one by the time i was five years old i knew i was black though the mirror did not reflect a black face i also knew that it was wrong to be black and i was sorry that i was black i knew that black children were not as good as white children or as smart or as pretty or as kind i knew that you did not like black children i knew that you did not want black children i did not know why this was so but i knew it was so when i went to school i walked eight blocks past the school for white children which was two blocks from my home in school i used the books that the white children had discarded every morning the teacher read the bible and the class pledged allegiance to the flag i pledged allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all but not for me i learned things in school i learned to read to write to spell to sing and to draw these were the things i was supposed to learn i also learned some other things i learned to wonder i learned to think this is where i made my mistake i learned the things i was not supposed to learn i learned to do things which i was not supposed to do i went to the concerts for public school children i sat in the back behind the white children the music sounded the same from the front or the back i learned this years later when i was allowed to sit in the front i went to the library the colored branch one day i went to the main library the one the white children went to my teacher took me she took the whole class we did not go to get books or to do the things the white children did there we went to sing for a recording that was the only place it could be done my teacher told us we must be very neat and clean that day she inspected each one as we arrived at school one girl could not go because her dress was old and torn the teacher told us we must walk slowlv in twos and we must m be very quiet we must not chew gum or laugh or touch anything the white people would not like it if we did any of the things she told us not to do and would not let us come back again we sang four songs on the recording one of the songs was go down moses go down moses way down in egypt land tell old pharaoh to let my people go i went to sunday school the teacher read stories from the bible she told me about god and about jesus she told me that god created me in his own image she told me that jesus was the son of god that he loved me that he died on the cross for me one day she showed me a picture of jesus he was white i went to church the preacher said i must repent of my sins i must accept jesus if i wanted to be saved he told me to pray our father who art in heaven hallowed by thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven thy will be done in america as it is in heaven the streets up there are paved with gold jesus loves me this i know i was washed in the blood of the lamb i used to play games with my sisters we played movie stars i was joan crawford my sister was margaret obrien one was jeanne crain the other one did not want to be a movie star so she was myree johnson we played paper dolls they were pretty and had long silky curls they also had beautiful clothes and were rich and white one christmas we got a doll a big doll with blond curls her name was mimi she was sitting under the christmas tree in a chair with her name printed on it the chair was yellow with blue letters mimi used to belong to a white girl named mimi the chair had been hers too the four of us shared the doll and the chair that had been mimis we did not know mimi but knew she was white and rich and wished we were white and rich sometimes i pretended i was mimi and sat in the chair that had mimi printed in blue letters one day i went to the supermarket with my sisters we passed some white children sitting in a front yard there go some brown pecks one of them said were white pecks and theyre brown pecks i smiled at the white pecks and did not mind being a brown peck when i was in high school i won an essay contest i wrote an essay on how to prevent tuberculosis i did not know how to prevent tuberculosis but i wrote the essay i won first prize i was in the tenth grade and i made an a in health because i won the contest the contest was only for colored schools because colored people have more tuberculosis than white people the first prize was forty dollars i went to a luncheon at a downtown hotel the health counselor at my school took me she told me to be neat and clean and not to chew gum she did not have to tell me to be quiet she inspected me before we left at the luncheon we sat at a table with two nuns and two white girls i received my prize and a photographer from the newspaper took my picture the picture was in the paper the next morning he had my address wrong with my prize money i bought a red skirt and a white blouse with red velvet ribbons for myself i bought my mother a blue dress with a lace jacket for ten dollars and ninetyeight cents the next day my father died two days later we had the funeral he was a veteran the government also gave us an american flag my father fought the second world war he was an american when i graduated from high school i went to the state university i was excited i was to stay in a dormitory i had to send a photograph with my application for the dormitory when i arrived at jewell hall the fourth counselor told me my room was d she said i would have a single room i had looked forward to having a roommate the janitor took me upstairs in the elevator he said to me you are the first one but two more are coming i knew what he meant i smiled i unpacked and the counselor took me to meet bettye and billie they were not in their room she did not introduce me to anyone else later i met bettye and billie and they came into my room to talk in a little while the assistant housemother tapped on the door and said that we were making too much noise she smiled when she said it and we smiled and we did not talk anymore they went to their room and i went to bed after that it seemed we were always making too much noise one day we saw the assistant housemother downtown and she did not speak the housemother had a friendly chat with each of the girls she asked me if i liked my room i said yes she asked if i had any problems i said no i did not go back for my second year i transferred to a municipal university the oldest one in the united states i do not live in a dormitory i live at home and it is hard to study there because the house is small and all the rooms open into each other i go to classes and sometimes i study in the library i sit by myself usually when i sit down no one sits beside me one day a girl moved when i sat down the next day she put her purse and her scarf and her books on the chairs around her i sat in the back of the room by the door i do not go to any clubs or activities although i would like to i think i am not wanted once i went to a club and one girl smiled at me sometimes people in my classes smile at me but they do not sit by me sometimes i smile back sometimes they ask me for an assignment or what happened at the class they missed sometimes i ask them but not often not if i can help it when i am with them i feel very very black very very stupid very very inferior when they laugh i think they are laughing at me when they look at me i think they are looking down on me i do not like to feel this way i want to cry to scream to hit them all of them who make me feel this way but i cannot cry that would show weakness i cannot scream that would show madness i cannot hit them that would show rashness so i hate them for making me feel this way and i hate myself for feeling this way and i hate my country i hate america for making me hate so i want to go away far away from it all i do not know where i will go but i will go because i must this is my country but i cannot live in it i will go to another country where i will be called a foreigner maybe people will be kind to me my country is kind to foreigners but i will not care if people are not kind to me in other countries i will go on i will not stay where they are not kind to me i will go on and on until i am away from everyone i will be somewhere on a mountain or by a lake or in a forest away from all people i will live there or i will die there i do not know which and i think it does not matter i cannot live in alabama i cannot live in kentucky i cannot live in new york i cannot live in california i am an american i will go maybe some day i can come back maybe some day i can live in mississippi goodbye family goodbye friends goodbye home maybe you will remember me goodbye america radicals are not by james r phillips s a writer whose work ja y has been accepted by several of americas outspoken ultraconservative magazines i feel i have as much right as the ksi sii next man to speak for the radical right and i believe the time has long since come when the radical right if it is to gain the respect it deserves as a legitimate movement in modern america must disown all the segregationists segregation as a concept is totally alien to the philosophy which stands at the root and heart of todays ultraconservative movement if any man be a segregationist he cannot be a true radical rightwinger and conversely no man who is truly a radical rightwinger can be a segregationist this fact is or by rights ought to be selfevident recent events make it clear that the fact is not selfevident and so i propose to right here and now set forth the principles of rightwing radicalism and invite all those who cannot live up to these principles to get themselves out of the modern ultraconservative movement and to go as far away from us as they can i would like to suggest south africa as a place they might enjoy for the philosophic basis of modern ultraconservatism is the natural law and the natural law as most people know holds that all men are created free and equal no one who believes that can possibly be a believer in white supremacy for the very idea of natural freedom and natural equality stands as an eternal contradiction to the claims of any race to be supreme yet still we are confronted by statements such as this ill never give up either to integration or communism they are one and the same as far as i am concerned i dont think any of you want a nigger mayor or a nigger police chief but i tell you thats whatll happen if we play dead on this park integration those words were spoken quite recently by art hanes ousted ex mayor of birmingham alabama the only major city in the united states still segregated exmayor hanes words are an affront to reason because they are so obviously untrue and even immoral many men of good will have chosen not to answer these words they are afraid that if they become involved in a duel of words with this rabid segregationist they will themselves be tainted they are fearful of the old political adage that you cant roll in the mud with a pig without getting dirty because most men of good will do not refute his words he stands unchallenged as a leading spokesman for what most people assume to be ultraconservatism i hereby challenge exmayor hanes right to speak for ultraconservatism in fact i challenge his right to even call himself an ultraconservative he is to be plain and simple in the choice of words a demagogue and nothing could be more alien to the concept of ultraconservatism than racist demagoguery mr hanes said that he doesnt think anyone wants to see a negro police chief well as an ultraconservative i voted for a negro for the position of attorney general of massachusetts last fall this man edward w brooke a brilliant lawyer was elected as chief law enforcement officer of the commonwealth of massachusetts he has done a darned good job so far he is moving to restore the atmosphere of integrity that was once the hallmark of massachusetts politics so many people are pleased with the job this man is doing that there is now talk in republican circles in this state of offering him the nomination for u s senate if he chooses to run and his opponent would be none other than teddy kennedy himself he would have at least a fair chance of victory he was the only republican to survive a democratic landslide in massachusetts last fall the prospect of my state sending a negro to represent us in the u s senate doesnt bother me at all personally id consider it to be a big improvement over the obnoxious little brother of the president now representing us in the senate if it would bother the ousted exmayor of birmingham alabama then one of us must be a traitor to the radical rightwing movement i feel the fact that my articles have been accepted by several national publications proves that my views are in accord with national ultraconservative thinking that means he must be the one who does not belong in the rightwing movement so i hereby invite him to get out of this movement and to take with him everyone who thinks like he does i dont think it will be any great loss to the ultraconservative movement and i know it certainly wont be any great loss to the nation the radical rightwing movement of today rests foursquare on the principles that motivated abraham lincoln and if any man seriously believes that lincoln would agree with mayor hanes then that man has not read history carefully abraham lincoln was a contemporary of karl marx and the record shows that lincoln forcefully and convincingly refuted the ideas of marx more than years ago yet lincoln did not feel that because he was an anticommunist he also had to oppose freedom and dignity for negroes many southerners to this day like to claim that the civil war was fought by the north to preserve the union to some extent this is true but it is only a halftruth it was no accident that the civil warwhich hung as a threat over america for a generation broke loose in all its bloody terror at precisely the time that lincoln was elected president lincoln had often expressed in public his personal wish that all men everywhere should be free in he won a plurality in a fourway race for the presidency southern states began seceding at once from the union by the time lincoln took the oath of office civil war had become inevitable to many in the north it was a holy crusade to free the negroes note the words in the battle hymn of the republic wherein does that battle song proclaim the preservation of the union as the number one goal of the north it did not rather it spoke of a wish to make men free the last time i checked a history book it said that the north had won the civil war since the north did win that war the principles which motivated that war should be by rights part of the american tradition the principle of freedom was the paramount cause of the war and it should be by now the basis of american tradition apparently men like mr hanes still do not believe that the south lost that war they are trying to preserve a prebellum southern philosophy as individuals they have a right to do sobut not in the movement which seeks to stand fast on the principles of abraham lincoln thus as an ultraconservative myself i must charge again that hanes cannot speak for us nor indeed can anyone who thinks like mr hanes speak for us not only are they out of step with the thinking that lies behind the rightwing movement of today but they also are out of step with the best of their own southern traditions lincoln himself stated that he had drawn his political principles directly from the thinking of a southernerthomas jefferson can mr hanes or any other man say that jefferson author of the declaration of independence and founder of the party he called republican which now calls itself democratic would agree in the slightest with the philosophy of to days white citizen councils how could anyone make such a statement and how could anyone claim that gen robert e lee another great southerner would have any sympathy with modern white supremacist views gen lee despised slavery and sought justice among men his heart was torn in two when he had to make the decision to return to virginia and lead the southern armies his conscience led him to defend the states rights views of jefferson who let it be remembered was so hostile to the strong central government under gen washington that he created a second party to stand for states rights he called that party republican simply because he wanted to remind people that we were a republic now many rightwingers have been criticized today for a slogan that says this is a republic not a democracy the criticism is i believe caused more by the hypocrisy of some southern white supremacists than it is by the slogan itself the slogan is historically valid it comes from a statement made by benjamin franklin as he was leaving the constitutional convention of a woman asked him if we had an aristocracy or a democracy he replied neither madame you have a republic if you can keep it now i do feel that it was a mistake for the rightwing movement of today to omit the word aristocracy we dont have one from its slogan this tends to make some people think that the rightwing movement is an aristocratic movement i can say from personal experience that this is decisively not so it is basically a middleclass movement why do i think it is important to stressas jefferson did when he began his new party in that this is a republic let me answer this with an example ancient greece was a democracy and in this democracy the majority could vote to grant or deny rights to individuals the individual had no rights in greece except those granted to him bv the majority through their political formthe state because of this greece had slavery a foul and odious evil when brave men such as socrates questioned such evil facets of the greek society they were liquidated socrates was orderedby a majorityto drink from the cup of poison hemlock here in my home state of massachusetts we had a democracy in the very early days the pilgrims and their fellowpuritans did not adopt the plantation system of rich planters so popular in southern colonies here from the day of the mayflower compact every basic decision was made by a majority voteand gradually the franchise was extended to include all men this democracy produced some unfortunate excesses for example the quakers were denied religious freedom and some were hanged on boston common as in greece the individual here had no absolute rights of course the democratic and collective spirit of the puritans in their early davs did produce some noted advantages boston for examole had set uo a free public school years before karl marx offered the idea to europe as a bold new innovation in his communist manifesto as a deep believer in our pilgrim tradition i naturallv take offense at those pennvpinching southerners who oppose spending on public schools especially for negroes on the grounds that such schools are communistic they are no such things they are as american as the mayflowerfor the pilgrims actually came to america to set up schools for their children who were learning the dutch language and foreign customs during their exile in holland from to boston and the massachusetts bay colony also had some of the worlds most advanced social welfare legislation we were as we are to this day a commonwealth and this word derives from the words common and wealth the idea of sharing took deep root here very early as a result we had few rich and almost no real poor we were basically a middleclass society with free public schools the best possible ground in which to plant the seed called democracy yet even here it fell short of its potential gradually the puritans began to go beyond the collective democratic traditions of our commonwealth we began to evolve the theory of individualism this theory was later to be promoted vigorously by such bay staters as ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau but earlier than that it was imbedded in our state constitution by such patriotscholars as john adams the supreme court of massachusetts declared slavery illegal in this state in four years before the american constitution was written because our constitution contained the phrase all men are born equal the court ruled that the constitution did not say just white men but rather all men the philosophy of a southerner thomas jefferson had won its first great battleright here in massachusetts unfortunately it did not win the battle for mens minds in the south it has not apparently won the battle to this day if i understand correctly the political philosophy of gov ross barnett of mississippi he feels that a majority in any one state has the right to deny individual rights to citizens of that state now that is not a new philosophy it was advanced by stephen douglas during his debates with abraham lincoln of course lincoln rejected such a notion out of hand he would as a jeffersonian he stated boldly that all men are by right free no democratic majority has a right to deny one man or men or men that freedom that is because fortunately we are a republic that is to say we have a bill of rights this bill of rights sets forth certain rights that individuals have rights that the federal government cannot take away from individuals even if per cent per cent per cent or per cent of the ople vote in a moment of temporary madness to take away such rights of course the people have a right to change the constitution through amendments but jefferson had stated himself in the declaration of independence that governments should not be radically changed except for good reason and the founding fathers made the process of amendment a long one to give people time to cool off before they rushed through amendments they might reject later the th amendment extended the protection of the bill of rights so that individuals were protected against state laws which tried to take away their individual rights thus the constitution prevents a majority of citizens in any one state such as mississippifrom inflicting a tyranny of the majority upon helpless individuals in a minority in that state here you have the essence of the rightwing slogan that this is a republic not a democracy put this way it really doesnt sound so bad in fact i think it sounds quite good thats why i get perturbed by southern racists who claim to be rightwing ultraconservatives and who nevertheless demand the right to have a democratic majority nullify the rights of individuals they are frauds hypocrites and liars that doesnt bother me what bothers me is that everyone who hears them thinks that all of us rightwing ultraconservatives are frauds hypocrites and liars for example i recently sold an article entitled negroes are winning equality in boston the boston story june to negro digest the editor of that publication a sensitive journalist seemed surprised that a rightwing radical like me could be so enthusiastically in favor of negro rights i wrote him a letter tying to explain that the difference between southern racists and myself is that when i say i believe in the bill of rights i mean it and they dont i hope he believed me but i rather doubt that he did he has no doubt been burned too many times by hypocrites to trust anyone any longer and thats what really bothers me about white supremacists russia has turned down a road that seems to lead towards racism they have been segregating and persecuting negro students from africa and they have begun shooting people predominantly jews reopening memories of zsarist pogroms from oldendays for economic crimes i believe that minority groups would turn again to the american system of free enterprise and constitutional safeguards of individual freedoms as their best and only hopeif the white supremacists were not discrediting those solid old american ideals let me give you two contrasting examples of the good and the bad in the rightwing movement to make my point anger at hypocrites clearer first lets take arizona this state most people agree is the hotbed of rightwing thinking in america today if rightwingers were really all racists this state would be more racist than alabama or mississippi yet look at what really happened the rightwingers in arizona repealed an old state law that prevented mixed marriages miscegenation the rightwingers believers in individual freedom held that it was solely a matter for the indivdual to decide and not one the state had a right to intrude upon can any negro take offense at the states action in leaving up to individuals whether they wished to marry in their own race or out of it i dont see how a negro could be anything but pleased by such an action i think it speaks clearly of the philosophy behind the current rightwing movement but then look at california by contrast i understand that rightwingers are quite strong out there too i also understand that two of their favorite bogey men today are milton eisenhower and supreme court chief justice earl warren i wont go into the reasons for such hostility on the part of rightwingers except to say that it is no secret warren has been a target for racist criticism ever since his opinion in the school desegregation case again what bothers me here is the hypocrisy early in world war ii earl warren was attorneygeneral of california he got the federal government to set up concentration camps for japaneseamericans from californiaincluding americanborn american citizens milton eisenhower was commandant of that nowinfamous concentration camp i wish i thought that today s critics of warren and milton eisenhower were all warreneisenhower critics years agobut i have my suspicions that many of todays critics were then among warrens and milton eisenhower s greatest fans the antijapanese hysteria in california then was obviously raciallymotivated after all hawaii did no intern its japaneseamericans wisconsin did not intern the germanamericans who had been attracted to midwest bund meetings during the s here in massachusetts where the yankees had shown what they thought of the flood of italian immigrants during the saccovanzetti trial in the mids no one proposed a concentration camp for italianamericans ven though many such people had not taken out citizenship papers and were still sending money home to italy when war actually broke out i personally have my doubts about earl warren and milton eisenhowerand my doubts grow out of their leadership in that concentration camp matter they proved then that they are alltoohuman and thus fallible they have made serious mistakes in judgments in the past and i now feel i have a right to maintain reasonable doubts about their wisdom and their infallibility but my doubts rest on their action against a racial minority not out of more recent acts in favor of such minorities thus i feel i am consistent in my rightwing views but that the racists are not i want to preserve all that is best in our tradition they seem determined to perpetuate all that is worst i have no hope of convincing honest and reasonable men of my sincerity and of the value of my idealsso long as white supremacists cloud peoples minds with their hypocritical babblings thus i hereby attack these phoniesand invite them to get out of the rightwing movement i want to see it made pure and decent what christianity did for africa by laurian cardinal rugambwa hristianit y most that precious is the thing africa has received from the west at an early date in christian history africa saw the church take roots in its soil st mark disciple of st peter founded the church at alexandria and flourishing christian communities soon existed all along the southern shore of the mediterranean the names of st augustine bishop of hippo st cyril bishop of alexandria st cyprian the martyrbishop of carthage head the lists of the christian saints and martyrs of north africa however this christian influence never penetrated south of the sahara and by the seventh century islam had replaced christianity in north africa the history of the church is made up of swings of the pendulum bright hopes followed by unexpected declines a step forward somewhere with a step backward elsewhere several heroic but rather unsuccessful attempts to christianize tropical africa were made during the th th and th centuries at one time great hopes sprang up in the th century at the conversion of the king of the congo whose son became a bishop of this christian kingdom nothing remained a century later however at the end of the th century and the beginning of the th century the christian faith began to be permanently implanted along the coastline of africa the slave trade had kept the center of the continent closed to christian influence it was only after the middle of the th century that christian missionaries began to move inland missionary work on a large scale in central africa did not get under way until the th century the progress of christianity in africa has been fantastic lacking reliable statistics for total christian population i shall use my own church as an example in there were only catholics in africa and by the number had only increased to and by only to then began the amazing period of growth in in and today the mark has been passed although future increases are not expected to be so spectacular one can never tell when dealing with a continent as vast as africa christianity has brought many benefits to the africans the greatest of these has been a strong faith in god africa has always accepted the existence of a one true god creator of heaven and earth but this belief was clouded by superstitious preoccupation with a world of lesser spirits christianity has liberated africa from the centuryold servitude of superstitious fear and practice in the sphere of human relations the christian faith has communicated to africa a knowledge of and respect for the basic human rights of the individual christianity has also given to africa a concern for the whole man not merely his spiritual and moral welfare but his physical economic and social welfare as well this has come by doctrine preaching and by the inspiring example of generations of selfsacrificing missionaries time was when the word missionary conjured up a vision of a father with a long beard sun helmet and high boots or a sister robed in white habit and veil but nowadays a missionary may just as easily resemble the ordinary young man and woman you pass any day on the streets of america or europe lay people are now coming out to africa in increasing numbers convinced that they have a special part to play here in the establishment of christianity they do not regard themselves as a stopgap because the number of priests and religious is too few for the work to be accomplished nor do they merely have the idea of placing their professional knowledge and skill at the service of the church they see their task as the christianization of the new milieu in which they find themselves their main objective is to give a practical demonstration of what it means to be a christian at home at work at leisure and in all the ordinary circumstances of life concern for the sick and diseased for orphans and the aged has always been a part of the christian tradition you are all familiar with the fine work of dr albert schweitzer cf lambarene in gabon but you must realize that there are thousands more devoted medical missionaries who have labored unheralded for years in littleknown corners of the african continent but it is in the field of education that the missions have brought perhaps the greatest contribution to the elevation of the african peoples in the not toodistant past the only schools in tropical africa were those built and run by missionaries colonial governments have recognized encouraged and supported this missionary endeavor in the field of education todays african leadersin every field government the professions and the churchowe much to the men and women who devoted themselves to the long painstaking process of leading an entire people along the arduous path of education i myself can testify to what has been accomplished in this field in tanganyika the catholic church has over young men and women under instruction this is just about half of the entire school population of the country the overall influence of christianity in africa is far greater than bare statistics might indicate although africa is only per cent christian the spirit of christianity has exerted a large influence on the development of the continent the fact that the majority of the educated class have received a good christian education has been one of the principal causes for this influence the church is beginning to take root in native structures it is not yet a hundred years since the first africans of modern timesthe martyrs of ugandashed their blood for christ today the christian seeds have sprung up and keep springing up from this soil made fertile by their blood and by the many sacrifices of the missionary generosity of the christian west the catholic church has chosen over africans for its hierarchy from among the african priests now in her service however the establishment of christianity does not mean only the conversion of individuals but rather the christianizing of a culture and this takes time bringing the christian mentality to african society is a process that grows slowly africans in general and african leaders in particular must realize this basic truth there is nothing in authentic christianity which is incompatible with the true values of our tradition and culture the gospel message will never require the elimination and destruction of what is good in our life and there is much that is good in the tribal structure and tradition christianity elevates and purifies where necessary but it does not destroy basic human values from an address before the national press club during cardinal rugambwas first visit to the united states by george e hardin tough hombre fast on the draw and willing to face hazards for small pay those were the legendary u s marshals of the breed glamourized by televisions matt dillon but for th century trailblazer luke c moore ayear u s marshal for the district of columbia legal skills wisdom and are his stock administrative in trade and his language the polished rhetoric of the new frontier rather than the coarse vernacular of his pioneer counterpart the yearold lawyer became the first negro to serve as a u s marshal since reconstruction days when he was swomin during a joint ceremony at which his predecessor j p mcshane took oath as head of all u s marshal offices frederick douglass held the district post from to and later became district recorder of deeds and minister to haiti mcshane figured prominently in the enrollment of james meredith at the university of mississippi president kennedy appointed moore as u s marshal for washington biggest and busiest district in the nation on may he took the oath of office on june from u s district court chief judge mathhew f mcguire in attorney general robert f kennedys office both the chief judge and the attorney general have praised moore as an affably capable man of integrity it seems that as far back as i can remember i have been interested in the law moore confided as he peered out a first floor window of the district court building at third and constitution from which he directs the widespread duties of his office for these duties which include such things as serving warrants escorting prisoners to penitentiaries all over the country and disbursing twicemonthly pay checks to a large number of federal workers marshal moore has a staff of deputy marshals of them colored and secretaries and clerks moore was born in collinsville ill february he was still an elementary school pupil when his

division nd division back at howard after the war moore took prelaw courses and graduated cum laude in with a degree in business administration which he finds invaluable in his present position it was at howard that moore met his wifetobe miss dorsie robertson of hot springs ark both were interested in law and had plans of helping each other through school but these were disrupted when their son charles michael now was born moore made his way through georgetown university law school by attending evenings while working as a clerk and crew supervisor in the terminal section of the washington post office he earned his law degree standing seventh in his class in june he was admitted to the district bar in september and to the u s court of appeals in out of school moore lost no time getting aboard the progress escalator he went into private practice as an associate in thelaw firm of cobb howard and hayes handling all kinds of cases in may of moore at was appointed assistant u s attorney

received thanks from people he saved from making rush decisions in moments of excitement on the other hand in court moore impressed juries and won judges respect in july moore was moved to the special proceedings office in the u s district court where he handles habeas corpus hearings motions preliminary hearings before the u s commissioner and extradition hearings the organizational structure in washington which make the district marshals office the largest in the country also helped moore get off to a smooth start in his duties as marshal because the court system of the district of columbia is technically federal the previous job moore had was in the same building as his headquarters now we worked closely with the marshal and his staff so many of the people i work with now knew me and i knew them he explained running the big operation calls for a skilled administrator the office handles about of the federal court processes served nationally its deputy marshals are three times the men in the runnerup southern district of new york city and it disburses about in salaries of court personnel witnesses jurors fees and other expenses moore credits his chief deputy silverhaired william hoch who has been in the marshals office years and chief deputy since january with playing an important role by carrying on much of the daytoday operation the marshall usually gets to his office about

auctioneers to dispose of confiscated property the deputies are constantly dealing with the public we have to be on guard at all times especially with seizures of property moore said tact and good judgment are required he added with his quick smile we must be careful not to seize the wrong property also after a year moore has adjusted to his new post and says ive been too busy to really miss the courtroom i liked my role as a trial lawyer and as a prosecutor this is a new challenge and im grateful to the president and the attorney general for this opportunity to serve the administration and the public the marshal slipped in another reminder of his respect for president kennedy and attorney general kennedy when he disclosed reading as about the only hobby he has time for and places the books profiles in courage and the enemy within as two he found interesting moore said he also likes professional football i can get out and enjoy the washington redskins now he winked a reference to the fact that the longsegregated team now has negro players moore called luke by everyone until he got his present job when it changed to marshal lives with his wife dorsie and son mike in a

grader at wheatley elementary school henr christophe by walter monfried urmoil and trouble t have often prevailed in haiti as at present vs but never has the little island realm had such exciting and saguinary drama as in the reign of its good king henri a century and a half ago henri christophe was a fullblooded negro of giant stature and strength uneducated and totally illiterate all his life he became a good general and an economic administrator of genius in his years as chief of the haitian state he gave it a wealth and prosperity unequaled before or since little is known of his early years he was born of slave parents in probably on kitts island in the caribbean the boy by turns was a mason sailor stable hand bartender waiter and billiard marker in an inn at cap haitien in his early twenties he had saved enough to buy his freedom haiti was then a french colony st domingue populated by whites and negroes the french revolution which broke out in created shattering emotions in haiti fear among the whites exultant hope among the slaves colored men who demanded the liberty equality fraternity promised by the revolution were publicly tortured and slain pierre toussaint toussaint loverture a yearold coachman and jean jacques dessalines a negros slave realized that haiti was ripe for revolt and determined to lead it they organized secret meetings of insurgents and collected arms in august of rioting mobs burned hundreds of plantations and sugar refineries and slaughtered thousands of white people the napoleonic wars which allied spain and england against france confused the haitian situation further toussaint joined the spanish forces on hispaniola the island made of haiti and the present dominican republic by he was chief of haiti and christophe was second only to him as an army general governor of cap francois province and a wealthy owner of a mansion how he attained such heights in a few years has not been revealed toussaint showed such unmistakable talents in repelling french spanish and british forces that he was called louverture the opener in france napoleon refused to acknowledge haitian independence and he sent an expedition of warships and soldiers to subdue the island he placed his brotherinlaw capt gen charles le clerc in command le clerc upon reaching haiti demanded submission which was refused the french force landed and found the earth scorched christophe himself put the torch to his own home and the rest of the city of cap francois then he and his followers took to the hills the french won battle after battle but their morale and health declined in the face of the elusive foe when le clerc announced that slavery would be restored thousands of haitians joined christophe realizing his error le clerc retracted declared slavery abolished and offered haiti independence under french supervision toussaint and christophe accepted the compromise christophe and dessalines were commissioned french generals in charge of haiti and toussaint retired to his plantation but sincerity was no part of the french scheme toussaint was kidnaped and sent to a paris dungeon where he died a year later from cold and neglect realizing that he had been hoodwinked christophe quietly resumed plans for rebellion yellow fever he noticed would defeat the french more decisively than his army could le clerc himself was one of the many frenchmen who died in the months of occupation and his remaining force withered and was driven to the sea in haitian independence was affirmed again dessalines ugly in appearance and temper headed the state he antagonized his subjects with his many mistresses his minuets and the harshness of his dictatorship after he was killed by a mob the leaders of haiti adopted a republican constitution and appointed christophe president chief governor and commander in chief of land and sea forces the haitian economy was in distress there was not even a national monetary system so christophe asked for and received more than gourdes on which he placed a value of a franc each with these he purchased the coffee crop sold it to foreign nations for gold and thus established a stable currency haitis basic coin is still called the gourde and is still valued at dessalines death was followed by a civil war alexandre petion part french and part negro a onetime general of toussaint led the rebellion which resulted in southern haitis becoming a separate state or republic christophe remained supreme in the north and assumed the title of king in emulating frederick the great of prussia he called his royal palace san souci without care for a man who couldnt read he had picked up a lot of general information with patience two of his educated officials taught him to write henri i that is all he ever could write an atheist himself henri established catholicism as the state religion and was crowned by a french priest who became the court chaplain he likewise set up a system of nobilityprinces dukes counts barons and knights among these noblemen were the count de lemonade and the duke de marmalade an elaborate court etiquette was decreed and if any of the peers came to court in slovenly attire or displayed uncouth manners he was likely to join the convict gang that for years labored upon christophes formidable citadel the monarch enforced a drastic labor code too all ablebodied men had to work from sunrise to sunset with an hour off for breakfast and two hours off at midday there were frequent mutters of slavery among the toilers but the land was cultivated effectively and haiti became wealthy not only in agriculture but in shipping and cotton manufacture from time to time the king of france or napoleonwhich ever was in powersought an alliance with haiti but henri replied in an insolent negative unlettered as he was henri realized the value of education established schools and imported teachers he also built a royal hospital and a rudimentary school of medicine directed by a scot dr duncan stewart who remained faithful to the end henri well realized that his monarchy would last only as long as his own strength and vigor although he had his son declared heir to the throne he shipped in gold coins to the bank of england where it was deposited in his wifes name in his last years he became increasingly harsh and eccentric he beat an officer whose uniform was wrinkled he noticed a farmer snoozing in the field and fired a cannon at him he who had been a billiard marker became a billiard addict his sole other recreation was an outgrowth of his boyhood masonry far into the night he toiled alone upon the citadels walls one day in he astounded his servants by saying that he was going to a nearby village to attend mass he entered the empty church knelt and collapsed dr stewart diagnosed it as a stroke which would prevent his ever walking again nonsense king henri replied im reviewing the army tomorrow the next day with the army at attention henri was carried to his steed he took a few steps and trying to mount collapsed to the muddy earth the army marched away shouting long live the king and when it was out of earshot shouted down with the king he knew the game was over he was taken back to his palace and fired a silver bullet into his head the rebels killed the crown prince but permitted henris widow and daughters to go to europe and enjoy their fortune haiti itself soon relapsed into its prechristophe languor and poverty the silver bullet has been a fascinating legend in the west indies ever since eugene oneill the american playwright learned of it in his travels and used it in one of his early plays the emperor jones in the play jones a onetime pullman porter becomes emperor of a tiny caribbean island and boasts that only a silver bullet can bring him down so the rebellious natives mold a silver bullet to end the emperors career a gallery of by william barrow the sounds one v hears from the direc tion of hollywood and the mai or tv net works can be believed negro actors are on the threshold of a breakthrough into realistic roles that is negroes will be presented in parts more in keeping with reality which is to say of course that they will be portrayed like other people this could lead to the establishment of negro actors as international matinee idols and the present success of at least three of these actors augurs well for this prospect harry belafonte for instance is already a romantic figure despite hollywoods nervous approach to his roles in films only in movies with allnegro casts have the movie moguls dared to exploit belafontes ample and obvious sex appeal the big expensive island in the sunwhich pussyfooted around the romance between belafonte and joan fontaine was a grand example of hollywoods timidity no virile handsome west indian male is likely to talk his way through a courtship with a beautiful woman whatever her color and the inference that one might was libel on that robust race of men the possibilities of belafonte as a lover are limitless and if the box office balks in dixie well there is all of europe and africa and asia to make up for it in recent years however belafonte has withdrawn from the movie scene leaving it pretty much to sidney poitier like belafonte poitier most often has appeared in romantic parts only in allnegro films or in strictly restricted situations in other films even in the highlyregarded lilies of the field his role is heroic without being romantic poitier however recently broke out of that bag by hiring himself out to moviemakers in europe in the long ships which was filmed in yugoslavia poitier portrays a dashing moorish sheik whose paramour is a lovely viking lady the history of the mediterranean world is rich in stories of the adventures of africans and europeans are not afraid to tell the stories following the precedent of belafonte who took a fling at producing his own movies odds against tomorrow sidney poitier has indicated that he has written a play which he may present on broadway in the near future the key role of course was tailored to his own individual talent europe which claimed actor gordon heath more than a decade ago and to which poitier temporarily escapes has been good to actor william marshall as well the indianaborn exile who found reasonably steady work in hollywood portraying various and sundry slaves has achieved enormous success on the continent particularly in shakespeares plays last summer he journeyed to spain and then on to africa to recreate the role of a missionary in the spanish film piedra de toque marshall had to share his shakespearean chores and laurels this year with another expatriate american actor earle hyman unlike marshall however hyman first found a niche among the shake earle henry hyman scott spearean actors at home during one season at stratfordonthehousatonic he had no less a leading lady than the great katherine hepburn hyman departed these shores early in for a tour of the european continent that began in norway echoes reverberating back across the atlantic indicated that his othello would have made the bard of avon proud hyman first gained recognition on broadway for the role which catapulted still another handsome young thespian into the hollywood spotlight that of the innocent young hero in anna lucasta henry scott graduated from such theater roles as brett in deep are the roots to the lead in the film version of anna lucasta and then finding no new roles dropped out of sight brock peters has been luckier during he appeared in two topbracket films to kill a mocking bird and the lshaped room and he also enjoyed a brief theatrical fling in the role of othello a singer of note as well as an excellent actor peters needs not worry too much about the dearth of feature roles for young negro actors concert and night club bookings are always available to him still it is as an actor that he would prefer to earn his spurs and as a romantic leading man he hasas his handling of the role of crown in porgy and bess proved all the qualifications as ripe material for romantic leading roles ossie davis emerged at just that moment when his star as playwright also was ascending davis like his gifted wife ruby dee had been around broadway for close to years making the best of whatever parts came his way not until he stepped into the a raisin in the sun role made famous by sidney poitier however did the public realize his romantic potential a few months later he was riding the crest of broadway stardom in purlie victorious his own satiric vehicle and even in purlies ramshackle environment and rustic language the actors glamor shone through perhaps now if the optimists are right the young actors now making a name for themselves in television and the theater will stand a genuine chance of making the grade as romantic leads there is a fine brace of candidateslonnie sattin ivan dixon and billy dee williams among them all three of these young men have scored heavily in the theatre sattin in body beautiful and the abortive kicks and company dixon in a raisin in the sun and williams in a taste of honey it remains to see whether theyand others like them will be able to slip through the breakthrough in the wall of racial prejudice coffee for the road by alex la guma hey were past the maizelands and driving through the wide low semidesert country that sprawled away on all sides in reddishbrown flats hey and depressions the land going south was scattered with scrub and thorn bushes like a vast unswept carpet far to the right the metal vanes of a windmill turned wearily in the faint morning breeze as if it had been wakened to set reluctantly about its duty of sucking water from the miserly earth the car hurtled along the asphalt road its tyres roaring along the black surface i please want another sandwich zaida said she sat hud died in a blanketed space among some suitcases in the back she was six years old and weaa y from the long speeding journey and her initial interest in the landscape had evaporated so that now she sagged tiredly in the padded space ignoring the parched gullies and stunted trees that whisked past theres some in the tin you can help yourself cant you the woman at the wheel said without taking her eyes off the road do you want to eat some more too ray not hungry any more the boy beside her replied he was gazing out at the barbedwire fence that streamed back outside the turnedup window how fars it to cape town mummy zaida asked munching a sandwich well be there tomorrow afternoon the woman said will papa be waiting of course theres some sheep the boy ray said a scattering of farm buildings went by drab dusty dominoshaped structures along a brown slope the mother had been driving all night and she was feeling fatigued her red eyes with the feeling of sand under the lids irritating the eyeballs they had stopped for a short while along the road the night before parked in a gap off the road outside a small town there had been nowhere to put up for the night the hotels were for whites only in fact only whites lived in these towns and everybody else except for the servants lived in the tumbledown mud houses in the locations beyond besides they did not know anybody in this part of the country dawn had brought depression gloom illtemper which she tried to control in the presence of the children after having parked on that stretch of road until after midnight she had started out again and driven the children asleep through the rest of the night now she had a bad headache too and when zaida said can i have a meatball mummy she snapped irritably oh dash it all its there eat it cant you the landscape ripped by like a film being run backwards redbrown yellowred pinkred all studded with sparse bushes and broken boulders to the east a huge outcrop of rock strata rose abruptly from the arid earth like a titanic wedge of purpleandlavender layered cake topped with chocolatecoloured boulders the car passed over a stretch of gravel road and the red dust boiled behind it like a flameshot smokescreen a bird its long ribbonlike tail streaming behind it skimmed the brush beyond the edge of the road flitting along as fast as the car look at that funny bird mummy the boy ray cried and pressed his face to the dustfilmed glass the mother ignored him trying to relax behind the wheel her feet moving unconsciously but skillfully on the pedals in the floor she thought that it would have been better to have taken a train but billy had written that hed need the car because he had a lot of contacts to visit she hoped the business would be better in the cape her head ached and she drove automatically she was determined to finish the journey as quickly as possible ray said i want some coffee and he reached for the thermos flask on the rack under the dashboard ray could take care of himself he did not need to have little things done for him give me some too zaida called from the back among the suitcases and grips dont be so greedy ray said to her eating eating eating im not greedy i want a drink of coffee you had coffee this morning i want some more greedy greedy children the mother said wearily children stop that arguing he started first zaida said stop it stop it her mother told her ray was unscrewing the cap of the thermos when it was off he drew the cork and looked in man there isnt any he said there isnt any more coffee well thats just too bad the mother said i want a drink zaida cried im thirsty i want some coffee the mother said wearily oh all right but youve got to wait well get some somewhere up the road but wait will you the sun was a coppery smear in the flat blue sky and the countryside scorched yellow and brown like an immense slice of toast quivered and danced in the haze the woman drove on tiredly her whole mind rattling like a stale nut behind the sunglasses her eyes were redrimmed and there was a stretched look about the dark handsome indian face her whole system felt taut and stretched like the wires of a harp but too tight so that a touch might snap any one of them the miles purred and growled and hummed past flat country and dustcoloured buttes the bakedclay gulches and low ridges of hills a shepherds hut lonely as a lost soul crouched against the shalecovered side of a flat hill now and then a car passed theirs headed in the opposite direction going north crashing by in a shrill wine of slipstream the glare of the sun quivered and quaked as if the air was boiling i want some coffee zaida repeated petulantly we didnt have no coffee well buy some coffee the mother told her well buy some for the road as soon as we get to a cafe stop it now eat another sandwich dont want sandwich want coffee a group of crumbling huts like scattered broken cubes passed them in a hollow near the road and a band of naked dusty brown children broke from the cover of a sheeppen dashing to the side of the road cheering and waving at the car ray waved back laughing and then they were out of sight the windscoured metal pylon of a waterpump drew up and then disappeared too three black men trudged in single file along the roadside looking ahead into some unknown future wrapped in tattered dusty blankets oblivious of the heat their heads shaded by the ruins of felt hats they did not waver as the car spun past them but walked with fixed purpose the car slowed for a steelslung bridge and they rumbled over the dry rockstrewn bed of a stream a few sheep their fleeces black with dust sniffed among the boulders watched over by a man like a scarecrow at a distance they passed the coloured location and then the african location hovels of clay and clapboard strewn like discoloured dice along a brown slope with tiny people and antlike dogs moving among them on another slope the name of the town was spelled out in whitewashed boulders the car passed the sheds of a railway siding with sheep milling in corrals then lurched over the crossing and bounced back onto the roadway a coloured man went by on a bicycle and they drove slowly past the nondescript brown front of the railway hotel a line of stores and beyond a burnt hedge a group of white men with red sunskinned windhoned faces sat drinking at tables in front of another hotel with an imitation dutchcolonial fagade there was other traffic parked along the dusty gravel street of the little town powdered cars and battered pickup trucks a wagon in front of a feed store an old coloured man swept the pavement in front of a shop his reed broom making a hissing sound like gas escaping in spurts two white youths pinkfaced and yellowhaired dressed in khaki shorts and shirts stared at the car their eyes suddenly hostile at the sight of a dark woman driving its shiny newness metal fittings factorysmooth under a film of road dust the car spun a little cloud behind it as it crept along the redgravel street whats the name of this place mummy the boy ray asked i dont know the mother replied tired but glad to be able to slow down just some place in the karroo whats that man doing zaida asked peering out through her window where ray asked looking about what man hes gone now the little girl said you didnt look quickly then will we get coffee now i think so the mother said you two behave yourselves and therell be coffee dont you want a cool drink no the boy said you just get thirsty again afterwards i want a lot of coffee with lots of sugar zaida said all right the mother said now stop talking such a lot up ahead at the end of a vacant lot stood a cafe tubular steel chairs and tables stood on the pavement outside in front of its shaded windows its front was decorated with old coca cola signs and painted menus a striped awning shaded the tables in the wall facing the vacant space was a footsquare hole where nonwhites were served and a group of ragged coloured and african people stood in the dust and tried to peer into it their heads together waiting with forced patience the mother drove the car up and brought it to a stop in front of the cafe inside a radio was playing and the slats of the venetian blinds in the windows were clean and dustless give me the flask the mother said and took the thermos bottle from the boy she unlatched the door now you children just sit quiet i wont be long she opened the door and slid out and standing for a moment on the pavement felt the exquisite relief of loosened muscles she stretched herself enjoying the almost sensual pleasure of her straightened body but her head still ached badly and that spoiled the momentary delight which she felt with the feeling gone her brain was tired again and the body once more a tightwound spring she straightened the creases out of the smart tan suit she was wearing but left the jacket unbuttoned then carrying the thermos flask she crossed the pavement walking between the plastic and steel furniture into the cafe inside the cafe was cool and lined with glass cases displaying cans and packages like specimens in some futuristic museum from somewhere at the back of the place came the sound and smell of potatoes being fried an electric fan buzzed on a shelf and two gleaming urns one of tea and the other for coffee steamed against the back wall the only other customer was a small white boy with towcoloured hair a face like a nearripe apple and a running nose he wore a washedout print shirt and khaki shorts and his dusty bare feet were yellowwhite and horny with cracked callous his pink sticky mouth explored the surface of a lollipop while he scanned the covers of a row of outdated magazines in a wire rack behind the glass counter and a trio of soda fountains a broad heavy woman in a green smock thumbed through a little stack of accounts ignoring the group of dark faces pressing around the square hole in the side wall she had a roundshouldered thick body and reddishcomplexioned face that looked as if it had been sandblasted into its component parts hard plains of cheeks with knobbly cheekbones and a bony ridge of nose that separated twin lakes of dull grc and the mouth a bitter gash cold and malevolent as a lizards a dry chapped and serrated pink crack she looked up and started to say something and then saw the colour of the other woman and for a moment the grey lakes of the eyes threatened to spill over as they gaped the thin pink mouth writhed like a worm in a puddle of milk as she sought for words can you fill this flask with coffee for me please the mother asked the crack opened and a screech came from it harsh as the sound of metal rubbed against stone coffee my lord jesus christ the voice screeched a bedamned coolie girl in here the eyes stared in horror at the brown tired handsome indian face with its smart sunglasses and the city cut of the tan suit coolies kaffirs and hottentots outside dont you bloodywell know and you talk english too hey the mother stared at her startled and then somewhere inside her something went off snapped like a tightwound spring suddenly loose jangling shrilly into action and she cried out with disgust as her arm came up and the thermos flask hurtled at the white woman bloody white trash she cried coolie yourself the flask spun through the air and before the woman behind the counter could ward it off it struck her forehead above an eyebrow bounced away tinkling as the thin glass inside the metal cover shattered and upset a stand of stale chewinggum the woman behind the counter screeched again and clapped a hand to the bleeding gash over her eye staggering back the little boy dropped his lollipop with a yelp and dashed out the dark faces at the hatch gaped the dark woman turned and stalked from the cafe in a rage she crossed the sidewalk her brown face taut with anger and opened the door of the car furiously the group of nonwhites from the hole in the wall around the side of the building came to the edge of the vacant lot and stared at her as she slammed the door of the car and started the motor she drove savagely away from the place her hands gripping the wheel tightly so that the knuckles showed yellow through the brown skin then she recovered herself and relaxed wearily slowing down feeling tired again through the anger she took her time out of town while the children gazed sensing that something was wrong then the boy ray asked isnt there any coffee mummy and wheres the flask no there isnt any cofile the mother replied well have to do without coffee im afraid i wanted coffee the little girl zaida complained you be good the mother said mummys tired and please stop chattering did you lose the flask ray asked keep quiet keep quiet the woman told him and they lapsed into silence they drove past the edge of the town past a dusty servicestation with its red pumps standing like sentinels before it two africans in overalls played draughts behind them past a man carrying a huge bundle of firewood on his head and past the last buildings of the little town a huddle of whitewashed cabins with chickenc scrabbling in the dooryard a sagging shearingshed with a pile of dirty tables of wool inside and a man hanging over a fence watching them go by the road speared once more into the redyellowbrown countryside and the last green trees dwindled away the sunlight danced and jiggled like a midday ghost across the expressionless earth and the tyres of the car rumbled faintly on the black asphalt there was some traffic ahead of them but the woman did not bother to try to overtake the boy broke the silence in the car by saying will papa take us for drives he will i know zaida said i like this car better than uncle ikes well he gave us lots of rides ray replied there goes one of those funny birds again mummy will we get some coffee later on zaida asked maybe dear well see the mother said the dry and dusty landscape continued to escape past the window on either side of the car up ahead the sparse traffic on the road was slowing down and the mother eased her foot on the accelerator look at that hill the boy ray cried it looks like a face is it a real face zaida asked peering out dont be silly ray answered how can it be a real face it just looks like one the car slowed down and the mother thrusting her head through her window peered forward past the car in front and saw the roadblock beyond it a small riotvan a landrover its windows and spotlight screened with thick wiremesh had been pulled up halfway across the road and a dusty automobile parked opposite it forming a barrier with just a carwide space between them a policeman in khaki shirt and trousers and flat cap leaned against the front fender of the automobile and held a stengun across his thighs another man in khaki sat at the wheel of the car and a third policeman stood by the gap directing the traffic through after examining the drivers the car ahead slowed down as it came up to the gap the driver signalling with his hand through his window he pulled up and the policeman looked at him stepped back and waved him on the car went through revved and rolled away the policeman turned towards the next car holding up a hand and the mother driving it felt the sudden pounding of her heart she braked and waited watching the khakiclad figure strolling the short distance towards her he had a young face with the usual redburned complexion of the land under the shiny leather bill of the cap he was smiling thinly but the smile did not reach his eyes which bore the hard qaulity of chips of granite he wore a holstered pistol at his waist and coming up he turned towards the others and called this looks like the one the man with the stengun straightened but did not come forward his companion inside the car looked across at the woman the policeman in the road said still smiling slightly ah we have been waiting for you you didnt think theyd phone ahead hey the children in the car sat dead still staring their eyes troubled the mother said looking out whats it all about never mind whats its all about the policeman said to her you know whats it all about he looked her over and nodded ja darkie girl with brown suit and sunglasses youre under arrest whats it all about the woman asked again her voice was not anxious but she was worried about the children never mind youll find out the policeman told her coldly one of those agitators making trouble here awright listen he peered at her with flinthard eyes you turn the car around and dont try any funny tricks hey our car will be in front and the van behind so watch out his voice was cold and threatening where are you taking us ive got to get my children to cape town i dont care about that he said you make trouble then you got to pay for it he looked back at the police car and waved a hand the driver of the police car started it up and backed and then turned into the road you follow that motorcar the policeman said were going back that way the woman said nothing but started her own car maneuvering it until they were behind the police car now you dont try any funny tricks the policeman said again she stared at him and her eyes were also cold now he went to the riottruck and climbed in the car in front of her put on speed and she swung behind it with the riottruck following where are we going mummy asked zaida are we going with those policemen ray asked you be quiet and behave yourselves the mother said driving after the police car the countryside redbrown and dusty moved past them the landscape they had passed earlier now slipping the other way the flat blue sky danced and wavered and the parched scrubstrewn scenery stretched away around them in the yellow glare of the sun i wish we had some coffee the little girl zaida said pointing aint polite by inez guienze hat with ole miss and birmingham in the news the subur ban housewife has become more sophisticated in her approach to race relations however this was not so a few years ago then the sole pursuit of many suburban housewives was providing the proper atmosphere for growth of a happy successful husband and welladjusted children it was of course important to the childs social future that he be wellmannered therefore no occasion was too slight to provide training in the social graces a typically wellgroomed poised suburban wife and her equally wellgroomed little boy boarded a suburban bus one day bb before birmingham they rode along peacefully with the child asking learned questions in his distinct fouryearold voice of course his diction was flawless quite to the surprise of the child a negro woman boarded the bus he stared at her intrigued then in his high pitched voice with lovely diction he said mommy mommy is that a nigger as he spoke he pointed excitedly to the negro woman the other passengers sensing the mothers embarrassment wondered how she would handle the childs faux pas ever so quickly so as to avoid a scene the mother red of face pulled the boys arm down gently she replied yes and dont point the color of law by joan brickman arrived home from the city to be told by our cook as i entered the kitchen door that simon our houseboy had left home at noon and had not returned thic mean only one thing he had been arrested by the police i immediately got back into my car and drove down to alexandra township a special area set aside for nonwhites to live in which lay four miles from our home on the main pretoria road which lead to the city of johannesburg i had often been into the township on missions similar to the one i was now engaged upon so i knew what lay ahead it was pm and the sun was just about ready to set which meant that within the half hour it would be dark a thought that did not make me very happy for the township at any time of the day was something to be avoided let alone in the evening when thousands of workers from the city were pouring into it fortunately the police station for which i was heading was not too far from the main road however the streets were unpaved slop water and heavy rains had eroded the surface and sides leaving deep ditches of three and four feet in place of gutters and huge ruts in the roadway this left very little room to drive a large american car i knew the chance i was taking if i inadvertently brushed one of the crowd or perhaps ran over a chicken a dangerous situation could arise and a possibility of even losing my lifeso great is the tension which exists today in south africa i drove carefully down the streets with bated breath trying to avoid the great big holes in the road the scrawny chickens emaciated dogs unkempt hungry children and the returning workers i had my revolver on the seat next to me in case of an emergency when brandishing it might have helped while the doors of the car were locked and the windows were closed i aroused considerable interest for not many whites driving alone entered the township especially women and at that time of the day some smiled with friendly eyes others were reluctant to give way as the car lurched drunkenly on the uneven road i arrived safe but slightly tense outside the police station where hundreds of africansmen women and childrenwere milling around outside on the street inside the grounds and in front of the charge office from the large crowd i knew that the police had had one of their intensive days of arrests as i said this was not a new experience i was continually on the hunt for some african male either from the factory where i worked or my own servants who had infringed one of the many laws which govern their lives but every time i entered a police station my heart twisted with pity as i gazed into the abject faces of those who had been taken prisoners and for those outside who had come to try and aid them since i was white they automatically made room for me some with sullen looks on their faces others with mere curiosity this was the time i felt ashamed of being white for without my white skin i would have had to take my turn which would have meant waiting for hours and then a hundredtoone chances are the waiting would in the end be in vain i entered the charge office through the entrance for whites and was not surprisedfor i had seen it oftento find a mass of humanity closely packed sitting on their haunches with hands clasped over their knees all over the floor a sea of black faces white eyeballs and tattered clothes there were about prisoners all male in a space where fifty would be crowded three african policemen stood at the counter and a white sergeant sat at a desk laughing as he held the phone to his ear i quickly glanced at the prisoners to see if simon was among them he was a big grin on his face for he had seen me as i entered the office his teeth shone white his black face glistened with perspiration my mtdem he said sotto voice those who heard him smiled and shared his happiness for a brief moment for a white person meant attention the paying of the fine and freedomuntil the next brush with the law the sergeant replaced the telephone onto the receiver yes madam he said in afrikaans i answered him in the same language saying i wanted to know why my servant had been arrested he could hear that i was not afrikaansspeaking so he asked me in english to point out the prisoner which i did he beckoned simon and shouted to him in afrikaans to come forward which was rather difficult owing to the very confined space in which simon had been sitting poor simon bewildered by trying to work out how he was going to get from where he was standing to the desk became more harrassed when the sergeant rasped in afrikaans for him to hurry having no alternative but to step on those in front of him he made his way to the desk they accepted being walked upon in silence for they knew the methods of the police by this time i was biting my tongue trying to avoid an argument for arguing with the police with regard to human feelings i had already found out was futile and usually made matters worse for me and the person i was trying to get released i could not however refrain from telling the sergeant that since the boy was from nyasaland he knew very little english and hardly any afrikaans for this info rmation i received a glare simon eventually stood in front of the sergeant the appropriate look of submission and humility on his round sweating facea look all africans have learned to use when dealing with the police if they fail to adopt this mien they are considered insolent and many times a swift working over by the guardians of the law will achieve this look which the police so much desire to see upon a blacks face meanwhile the sergeant was shuffling through masses of papers trying to find simons he located it looked at simon then looked at the charge sheet this boy is a foreign native he said yes i replied why was he arrested his papers are all in order well it seems madam he was picked up in the township why should he be arrested for that i asked mystified foreign natives are not allowed in the township it is against the law good grief i exploded surely there is not a law against that yes madam no foreign natives are allowed in the township and what is more he cannot sign an admission of guilt and pay a fine he must appear in front of the magistrate can i bail him out i queried oh yes but it is five pounds and he must appear in court tomorrow morning at ten oclock i took the five pounds from my purse and laid it upon the counter fuming at the thought of how much this represented to an african the majority of africans working on the land and in the homes were lucky if they received this amount as a monthly wage simon was fortunate for i had the money and would pay it for him but what of the hundreds who did not they were sent to prison usually to a farm jail where they would serve a grim threemonths sentence working for the white farm owner and on their release if they were originally sentenced because their pass book was not in order they were immediately picked up by the police and the whole cycle was repeated the sergeant asked an african policeman for the bail book in which to record the five pounds but was told that a certain policeman had locked itin the safe taken the keys with him and had gone off duty receiving this information with a bland look he turned to me and said he was sorry but he could not take the bail for he did not have the necessary release book i was dumfounded and asked if this meant that my servant had to spend the night in jail yes he answered quite unconcerned i am afraid there is nothing i can do the sergeant concerned lives eight miles away and i even think he has gone out for the evening he shrugged his shoulders he cook the keys by mistake there is nothing i can do keeping my voice level and trying to remain composed i asked what would happen others had the necessary fines or bail money nothing would happen theyll all have to spend the night in jail the book is locked up until eight oclock tomorrow morning he was not the slightest bit upset if my boy is allowed out on bail and i have the money i demand his release i shouted waving the five pound note under his nose just then a plainclothes detective entered the office and noticing i was upset he asked me what the trouble was i told him the story and ended up by saying with a great deal of feeling is there no justice at all in this country he was evidently senior to the sergeant for he told the sergeant that since i had offered the money for bail i was entitled to get the boys release furthermore since the african was employed by me they could in any case release him without bail on my responsibility providing i apeared the following morning in court at last i had simon on my side of the counter with nothing but the necessary promise to return the following morning the sergeant told one of the african constables to get simons bicycle which was recorded on the charge sheet and which he had been riding when arrested i then knowing the law asked what would happen to him if he rode the bicycle home it was already pitch dark and since he left the house at noon he had no light on the bicycle would he be arrested oh yes he answered it is against the law to ride without a light this meant a fourmile walk for simon pushing his bicycle i knew this would not interest the sergeant in the least so i refrained from making a remark now for the sixtyfour thousand dollar question i said with sarcasm since the police station is in the township and simon is a foreign african who is not allowed in is it possible that he can again be arrested on the same charge on his way out oh yes madam foreign na tives are not allowed in the township it is against the law then be so kind as to tell me how am i going to get him out i asked fit to burst i have no idea madam you must just hope that there are no police around he said very calmly by this time simons bicycle had been brought in and all i wanted to do now was to get out of the place for misery for those who had no help engulfed me looking at the bicycle i saw both tires had been deflated i asked why well we do this in case the boy tries to run away the detective said impatiently i looked at him in amazement all my life i had witnessed the arrest of africans but had never seen one run away who had actually been stopped perhaps if they saw the police in time and they were a good distance away they might make a dash for it but the south african police are wonderful marksmen and unless a man were really desperate most of them would never attempt to escape for fear of being shot i was disgusted and close to tears from utter frustration i asked for a pump so they could be reinflated sorry madam we do not have a pump was the sergeants reply as he turned to his desk a note of finality in his voice i had now spent one hour and fifteen minutes trying to obtain my servants release miserable and full of hate for those who allowed this to go on i told simon that we would try and get the bicycle into the car the trunk of the car was filled with suitcases and we managed eventually by leaving the one door open a few inches to squeeze the bicycle into the back it was necessary for simon to kneel on the front seat and hold the back door to keep it from flying open for we had no rope with which to tie it thus we traveled the four miles home on the way i asked simon why he went into the township no medem he replied me not in township when they catch me me going into township to by musick record but me not get there yet where did they arrest you then i asked outside medem on pretoria road they come ask for pass then tells me i must go police station did you ask them why i asked knowing full well that an african never asks a policeman why oh no medem the policie big skelms when you ask why i know my medem would come the next morning full of indignation for i had had the whole evening to brood on what had taken place simon and i set out for the alexandra police station arriving at the building that served as court which was close to the police station we joined the throng of milling people i made inquiries as to seeing the magistrate prior to his going into court and was told which office to enter we found a niche and stood watching the crowd there were at least three hundred africans standing around apart from the police and the officials i was the only white person young and old male and female stood in groups or singly all intent on trying to help or hear the worst the prisoners were hustled out from a wire cage which surrounded a small corrugated iron building large enough to hold perhaps thirty people with comfort i counted one hundred and twenty persons coming through the gates the bystanders as they recognized their friend or relative shouted in their own language causing quite a din the magistrate entered the office i told simon to remain where he was knocked at the door and was told to enter he was sitting at a desk reading a document which he duly completed before looking up to see who had entered i told him what had occurred the previous evening at the police station what he thought i do not know for he made no comments i then told him that my servant had intended going into the township but had not reached it when arrested thats his word against the police the magistrate stated in a terse voice i realize that does not count very much i said i am however inclined to believe my servants account of what had actually taken place to that of the police thats your prerogative i must go along with the police he stated flatly i then asked him how foreign africans were to know that it was forbidden them to enter the township were there notices put up in their language telling them of the law no he replied nothing is put up to inform them they usually find out the hard way i asked him if he thought this was justno warning given fining them more than a months wages for committing a crime they were not aware of that is not for me to say i am here to enforce the law and that is all i am concerned with trying to find out what else was against the law so that i could at least warn my servants i asked what was the ruling concerning the bus depot for this fell in the boundary of the township and all the buses terminated and ror menced their routes from there it is out of bounds for all foreign natives he replied in an irritated voice not to be discouraged i asked if my servant catches a bus at our home to go into johannesburg what must he do to be within the law to be able to complete his journey all the buses turned into the township without stopping the last official stop being half a mile up the road well he replied i would say he can jump off the bus as it turns into the township and walk up to the next stop wait for it to come out and then continue is it not against the law to jump off a moving vehicle i asked in a sweet voice oh yes but that is the chance he must take was the enlightening answer or else walk a mile in other words i said whatever they do they are wrong including riding on a road outside of the township and being arrested for being inside of the township and being arrested for being inside of it and is that justice madam that is your boys story but to give him the benefit of the doubt let this serve as a warning to him and i will not prosecute in this instance he may go i thanked him and left the office stepping into the hot sun my vision blurred with tears at the thought of all those as innocent as simon who had no white person to help them some were real offenders but most were mainly infringers of the cursed pass laws the fines that were levied against them were way out of proportion to the pittance they earned as wages in many instances they were unable to pay and were then sentenced to three months imprisonment most of them ending up on the farm prisons this is an official means of forced labour to help the farmers who because of the low wages and other unattractive working conditions which they offer are unable to get help the last government statistics available for africans arrested for infringing the pass laws has just been published for the year over three hundred and seventyfive thousand africans were arrested that year for contravention of the pass laws over a thousand per day these are not criminals merely unfortunate human beings with black skins who have wittingly or unwittingly not complied with the south african laws governing the black people the fighting fiftyfourth by joseph r rosenberger negro soldiers of i the unions th j j massachusetts stared across charleston harbor at the church spires painted against a sunstreaked dusk federal bombardment had begun early that morning and clouds of smoke still hung overhead the air smelled of gunpowder and death foretold of violence and mans inhumanity to man the soldiers watched the parapets of fort wagner less than a mile away from where they lay hidden the union command considered charleston one of the prized targets of the confederacy and having massed troops were determined to seize the city which was a provoking symbol to the north the citys southern aristocracy was inordinately proud of setting off the rebellion and firing the first shots of the civil war but this was not the only reason the city had to be stormed it had further strategic assets as a major port through which confederate armies were supplied from abroad fort sumter the federal bastion captured by south carolina troops at the start of the great and bloody conflict was the key to the harbor but maj gen quincy gillmore the union commander urgently needed fort wagner before he could blast sumter into submission the men of the th joked and laughed trying hard not to think of what lay ahead still there were little knots of fear in each man tension is normal with even experienced battlehardened troops but these men had never seen battle before not to any great extent having engaged in only one skirmish on nearby james island a few days before and here they werewould soon be called to take at bayonet point the strongest single earthwork ever constructed the men knew they were marked on james the confederates had swarmed upon them screaming with hate black flag no quarter no quarter the fanatic southerners had taken no prisoners from the regiment then nor would they willingly do so tonight for the th massachusetts was then the most controversial regiment on the face of the earth while its officers had been handpicked from prominent new england families its noncommissioned officers and men were negroes the first free negroes authorized by the war department each soldier lost in his own thoughts knew he would have to face more than confederate bullets he would also have to face deep and unreasonable resentment he was already facing that the southern papers were calling them apethings jeering that they will run like frightened black sheep at the first sight of their former masters nor was it much different in the north where many a negro had been senselessly attacked after leaving the recruiting station in fact the prejudice against the negro troops was so strong in many parts of the north that they had to be smuggled to the train one at a time to forestall future attacks little wonder that angels laugh at man nevertheless out of the jeers and insults out of the brutality and laughter had come an intense pride in the regiment and in the grim challenge they faced sgtmaj lewis douglas son of the frederick douglass who hac escaped from slavery to became the most prominent negro abolitionist and publisher remembered the words his father had printed men of color to arms who would be free must themselves strike the blow and their own colonel the decorated robert gould shaw called the th as good a regiment as any that has marched now colonel shaw walked among his men on the beach his trim figure outlined against the sand dunes he seemed young almost boyish despite the lines in his face and his stiff blond mustache his troops snapped to rigid attention as he approached but puffing on a cigar he motioned them to rest for two days they had had little sleep had eaten and drunk less and every moment of rest was precious the men had an intense devotion for shaw and many followed him with calls of good luck sir only years old and a few years out of harvard shaw was already a battlehardened officer he had been severely wounded at antietam and had barely escaped death at winchester when a bullet struck his watch brig gen george c strong the ths brigade commander suddenly galloped up to the men it was he who had personally led the landings on morris island the week before he stood there now resplendent in full uniform the men rose to attention their sharp bayonets glistening in the last rays of the evening sun shaw and strong exchanged salutes strong spoke first you may lead the column if you want your men are worn out i know but you can do as you choose shaw could have refused with honor his men were exhausted and there would have been no taint had he declined the offer and placed the th in a supporting position for the attack his men crowded around shaw as he answered quietly i and my men will lead the advance sir and well carry the flag with us a thunderous cheer rang out from his men all along the line the men would fight how well would they fight that was a question still to be answered only two months before on may boston had prepared a thunderous welcome for the th with crowds swarming around the common filling every sidewalk balcony and window along the route of march it seemed that half of massachusetts had packed itself into the heart of the city about in the morning the watchers at the flagdraped corner of park square and boylston street heard the first rousing strains of the john brown song a few moments later the long blue column of soldiers with shaw at its head swung down the street boots beating against the pavement in perfect cadence new enfield muskets at rigid rightshoulder symmetry william lloyd garrison the nations most outspoken abolitionist for years watched the parade with tears rolling down his cheeks at the state house gov john a andrew and officials from all new england proudly greeted the regiment senator henry wilson said in his speech i do not know when in all human history to any given men in arms has been committed so proud a work so precious so full of hope and glory as the work committed to you fate must have smiled at these strong words for no one could laugh away or deny the dangers facing these colored soldiers the confederate government had already announced that any captured white officers of the th would be shot on the spot as for a negro soldier if he somehow escaped being instantly butchered he would be sold into the living death of slavery further complicating the matter were political obstacles equally as severe as southern ruthlessness and brutality even president lincoln feared for a formation of a negro regiment would stir violent resentment among the border states while many war department officials considered the negro troops worthless the peace democrats of the north would have none of it declared the boston pilot in bold type they are as fit to be soldiers of this country as their abettors are to be its statesmen maintained many union officers why one southern regiment of white men could whip regiments of niggers in an hour only after lincoln had issued the emancipation proclamation on jan would he approve the formation of the th needless to say the eyes of the entire nationif not the worldwere on these men and for good reason there was a severe shortage of soldiermaterial of manpower in the north but there still remained the northern negroes the very last untapped source if the th could prove itself under the bloody baptism of southern fire the president would then recruit at least new colored regiments the formation of the new regiment began governor john andrew who had championed the cause for the negro regiment chose shaw for one good reason the shaw family hated the southern system fervent abolitionists the shaws were almost the first people of wealth to make known their views against slavery shaw went at once to boston to launch a recruiting drive while frederick douglass led the movement in new york city his two sons lewis and charles were the first recruits come may th and the quota of the th was filled not only that but there were enough volunteers to form the nucleus of a second negro regiment the th this was not because of low recruiting standards quite the contrary shaws standards were high of negroes from new bedford for instance only two could not read or write a record few white northern regiments could equal proudly shaw wrote his bridetobe the mustering officer tells me that he has never seen so fine a set of men though about have passed through his hands since september an intense training period began secretary of war edwin stanton ordered the th to join general gillmores forces in the southern command but there was trouble ahead and shaw could see the signs antinegro copperhead factions demanding immediate peace with the south thundered that well kill ever damned nigger we gets our hands on and that includes the white trash that leads them shaw had planned to send the th to new york by train but later had his men moved south by ship after being warned by new yorks police commissioner that he could not be responsible for the regiments safety even riots threatened in boston in spite of that citys jubilant reception of may shaw wisely ordered his rear guard to march through the city with fixed bayonets two hundred reserve policemen were held in readiness around the common but the vindictive antinegro factions made known their resentment in a more subtle manner residents pulled down their shades to hide the sight of colored troops the exclusive somerset club locked its doors and blacked out its windows on june rd the troops of the th landed at hilton head south carolina part of the complex chain of coastal islands already held by union troops at once shaw had them parade through the dusty streets of hilton head their bayonets set their boots and leather highly polished other troopswhite troopsrushed to the streets in disbelief their mouths open in awe as the long blue column with drums beating and banners flying marched and wheeled in perfect precision soon the streets were lined with cheering spectators shaw was proud of his troops and they were proud of themselves and of him general gillmore planned a twopronged attack on charleston while brig gen a h terry made a diversionary strike at nearby james island gillmore landed pieces of artillery parrott guns and siege mortars at one end of morris at the southern rim of the harbor by july gillmore had gotten his artillery within yards of fort wagner before the confederate counterattack stalled his plans two days before shaw had been ordered to take his men by boat to join general terry on james so on july men of the th stood picket duty with the th connecticut regiment confederate general p g t beauregard who commanded the charleston area decided to do something about it reinforcements were rushed from other forts and the southerners struck that morning with five regiments supported by cavalry and artillery the th connecticut was quickly thrown back by the savage confederate attack not so with the th supporting it for over three hours the negro troops stood fast refusing to retreat as much as one inch one soldier later wrote to his mother the bullets were so thick that i could actually feel the wind of them it was a miracle that i wasnt killed the ths stiff stand and resistance gave the th connecticut time to pull back and reorganize wrote a war correspondent had the th given way had they fallen back the retreat of the th would have been cut off and they would have been completely annihilated later representatives of the th visited the ths bivouac to thank them and general terry sent shaw his personal commendation there was no time for celebrating however gillmore ordered terrys force from james to morris island for the major assault on fort wagner shaw had to march his men all night through a blinding rainstorm to cover the length of the island thunder rolled and jagged lightning knifed down from the angr heavens marching along a narrow path through swamps and underbrush the men had to march single file each man often holding the belt of the man in front branches clawed their faces and mud weighed their boots it took the regiment seven hours to cover the four miles to the embarkation point they fell to the ground exhausted that morning the th was carried by boat to morris island there was little doubt that soon in a matter of hours the negro soldiers would face their real baptism of fire shaw led his men on the final sixmile march up the sandy island to the front reaching their positions just before pm other regiments having heard about the ths stand on james cheered wildly as the colored troops passed am it was hot and the sky was cloudless general gillmore ordered the union guns to open fire on fort wagner it was one of the epic bombardments of the war as the fort was blasted with over pieces for six hours brig gen william b taliaferro later estimated that almost shells had been fired against his positions wagner was a strong fort built of palmettolog revetments with bombproofs holding a deep moat protected its doublebastioned face there was only one approacha sandy spit narrowing just before the fort to only a few hundred feet huge naval guns and howitzers covered this approach pound cannon and howitzers provided the flanking fire from two salients further firepower could be provided from confederate batteries on sumter james and sullivan islands even if the union troops reached the fort through the blistering fire they would still have to fight their way up a foot slope against a select corps of infantry and artillerymen for hours union shells tore great furrows in wagners embankment now and then confederate guns returned the fire by four oclock they no longer answered and general gillmore half convinced himself that the confederate artillery had been knocked out of action confederate general taliaferro was no fool actually he had sandbagged most of his guns from the very start of the union bombardment with the result that not one of his weapons had been as much as scratched his men tuckea in the bombproofs had suffered few casualties this was just one of the many union miscalculations now the wily aliaferro brought his cannon back into position gillmore delayed his assault until dusk giving beauregard a few hours to rush reinforcements from the mainlandanother union mistake gillmore had planned the attack carefully having organized his force of men into three brigades at pm the th took its position at the head of the column with regiments from connecticut new york maine and new hampshire behind it shaw rode down the line and in a ringing voice told his troops the future of the negro soldier will be decided this night with gods help well plant the flag on wagners ramparts the attack was ready to be launched but the union command had fumbled badly no plan of the fort or terrain was ever shown the regimental commanders it is doubtful if the high command ever knew about the sandy spit they would have to cross would be virtually cut in half by the tide one officer col h s putnum suspicious of the whole business was to remark we are going to be slaughtered like innocent sheep pm darkness was very close the western sun burned but very faintly and a heavy fog was drifting in from the silent sea distant thunder rolled across the horizon pm shaw ordered the th to attention he then reminded them that the confederate government had threatened to kill all captured negro troops men he said simply you will either have to take the fort or die there he drew his sword and his officers shook hands then shaws sword flashed downward the negro troops of the th massachusetts swarmed across the sand the march into hell had begun a march that would make negro history the men moved at quicktime at first then shaw shouted for doublequick not wanting to take any chances there was not sound no shot from the fort the men reached a point about yards from the fort where the water cut the sandy spit in half confusion now became the order of the day men were forced into the sea to their knees officers struggled to maintain formation but platoons and companies were hopelessly mingled together they struggled on toward the fort they were only yards from the fort when wagners guns cut loose cutting the front lines to bloody pieces the regiment wavered for a small moment seemed to stop shaw plunged forward shouting onward onward the lines came to life and followed him the men of the proud th moved forward running now stumbling into holes made by cannon balls falling over tangled masses of their own dead hail after hail of grape and cannister shot poured into their lines and musket fire chopped down the attacking figures few troops had ever stood against such concentrated artillery fire in such a confined space death grinned fiendishly and black men were blown into eternity still they kept coming as shaw screamed charge but the confederates had more in store for the brave men of the th reb batteries on sumter sullivan and james islands now opened up with a terrible crossfire ripping the rear of the regiment to shreds and pinning down the regiments behind so that the colored soldiers were virtually isolated yet they continued to move toward death forty yards from the fort they ran into the moat in which water was four feet deep many of the men were caught and dropped by rifle fire from the ramparts others drowned the advance wave started up the dangerous slope of the parapet and from the top the st north carolina regiment fired down on them the charlestown battalion blasted them from the right salient the men of the th began going up the hellslope howitzers blew them into nothingness grenades knocked them back into the moat they did not retreat on and on they came determined not to retreat shaw and thirty of his men reached the top in a few minutes they fought in a circle with knives and bayonets as maddened southern infantry met them with musketbutts handspikes and gunrammers but the ths regimental flag had been planted on the slope the man carrying the national flag reached the top and was killed but sgt william carney caught the flag before it fell he managed to hold the flag aloft for minutes before he was riddled with minnie balls four union officers crawled into an embrasure of the right salient killing the gun crew with their revolvers three other officers two of whom were killed a few seconds later even reached the left bastion of the inner fort the men at the fort could still hear shaw crying attack attack through the fire and smoke they could still see his sword slashing at the grayclad confederates surrounding him then he fell riddled with shot as his troops fought like demons around his body only to fall later around his lifeless form what was left of the th clung desperately to the slope sweeping the crest with their muskets victory was still possible at this point but the supporting regiments failed to follow through several regiments close behind the th could have taken the fort but instead only small units from the connecticut and new york reached the parapet and fought only briefly in one salient the rest of the brigade lay pinned down in front of the moat the momentum had been lost and only havoc and confusion remained on that thin strip of sand the dead and the wounded lay as one piled together in a ditch sometimes in a heap strewn all over the place for threequarters of a mile of members of the th in the attack almost half were killed wounded or missing the total union losses exceeded men of eleven regimental commanders eight had been killed or wounded colonel shaws body was stripped of its uniform and his personal belongings stolen by southern soldiers general gillmore requested that the body be returned for a military funeral and was told by a confederate officer we buried him with his niggers confed erate gen johnson hagood told a captured union officer i would have given him an honorable burial had he been in command of white troops but since he wanted to lead nigger troops i had him buried with them in the common trench he led animals and i buried him with animals this scornful message was widely circulated in the north and newspapers screamed for revenge against southern sadism the plight of captured negro troops immediately became a very explosive issue south carolina demanded that five captured members of the th be turned over to the state by the military for trial under local slavery laws the men would either be shot or sold into slavery the north demanded action and action it got when president lincoln announced that a confederate soldier would be shot in retaliation for every u s soldier executed in violation of the war code lincolns stem announcement stopped the south and captured negroes as well as their white officers were consequently transferred to military stockades fort wagner became a national symbol said president lincoln it is a grave which will be sacred for all time to come proclaimed the new york tribune fort wagner has done for the colored race what bunker hill has for years done for white yankees the battle for fort wagner had done more it proved to even the most dogmatic and bigoted of critics that negro troops could more than hold their own against the cream of the confederacy wagner was not finally captured until sept th but the brilliant record of the th persuaded the administration to speed up negro recruitment in the next months more than negroes were enlisted in the army of this amount would eventually be killed wounded or missing almost enlisted in the navy which had never had discrimination the negroes of our own times can be proud of the th massachusetts regiment yet there is a terrible sadness and a deep shame about all this which cannot be denied or ignored a sadness that perhaps still clings to the silent ghosts of those negroes who died at fort wagner fighting for freedom to those dark men who died in the spanish american war in world war i and world war ii a sadness and bitterness because while they fought and fought well and died wellthey still must see their living brothers held down as secondclass citizens under the very flag which is the world symbol for freedom the flag under which these silent ghosts once lived the very flag for which they died the deep shame should be felt by all men who would deny freedom and equality to others to those descendants of the men of the th massachusetts who so many many years ago fought and died and wrote negro history with their very blood wht e supremacya dead ly disease by howard seals white supremacy is irrational in a manner and degree constituting mental illness white supremacy in practice constitutes psychotic behavior it is a mass delusion it is an ethnic psychosis fixed on the delusive veneer of skincolor and it is axiomatic in the curing of mental illness that cure can only be effected in those cases where the patient wants to get well the social psychosis of white supremacy is not a negro problem but a problem of distortions in the minds of white t people negroes at best involvement can only aggravate the social consciences of white people into an awareness and confrontation with the illness of white supremacy negroes themselves can never solve the race problem simply because they do not cause the problem negroes do not formulate the bases for the practice of racial discrimination nor do they continue and perpetuate the practices of racial supremacy it is not the negros problem but the problem of white people it is white people who must confront and solve the problem negroes can only perform the incidental tasks of helping white people to recognize the problem the final solution must come from whites alone so long as white people fail or refuse to recognize the problem any gains achieved by the negro minority will only be temporary and will eventually be lost in a relapse to former conditions of racial oppression some form of the irrationalities inherent in the separate but equal delusion continues to dement white people as it has for centuries despite the supreme court decree which held separate but equal to be inherently unequal in earlier times this delusion was articulated as the white mans burden in which an enlightened divinely favored white people undertook the burden of leading their savage and pagen black brothers to divine salvation it was held that these accursed people were to be enslaved for their own betterment the slave uprisings insurrections and the civil war debunked the presumptions of the white mans burden and so it was rephrased as separate but equal separate but equal was codified by the united states supreme court in in the case of plessy v ferguson and was finally overturned years later in the supreme court decision today separate but equal has been recast in what seems best summarized as the concept lead your people it is tragically ironic that todays recasting of separate but equal was presaged in justice harlans dissent from the majority opinion in the aforementioned case of plessy v ferguson it is significant that while justice harlan appeared to be exceptionally liberal courageous and egalitarian in his dissenting opinion yet in the context of the very same dissenting opinion he affirmed his belief in race pride in this dissent he wrote every true man has pride of race and under appropriate circumstances when the rights of others his equals before the law are not to be affected it is his privilege to express such pride and to take such action based upon it as to him seems proper mr justice harlan while appearing to be just was merely rephrasing separate but equal what he failed to understand is that any pride which is based on qualities thought to be inherent in one race necessarily implies an inferior inheritance in other races today the race pride which justice harlan affirmed as valid is now devolving into the delusive attitude of lead your race it is now contended by the most liberal and apparently responsible white people that great progress has been made that vast opportunities have opened up for negroes and that it is now only a matter for negroes to lead and prepare their people to fill the positions of opportunity it has been the speciously proud boast of white liberals to cite the example of a ralph bunche a carl rowan or a james b parsons as proof of what a prepared negro can achieve but in actual truth the preparedness of ralph bunche should have caused him to be elected president of the united states carl rowan should have become a senator from his home state of tennessee james b parsons is sorely needed as governor of the state of illinois neither of these men has the slightest chance of attaining a position comparable to his merits essentially a negro must still as it were train himself for the position of officemanager in order to someday work up to the job of officeboy the slow progress in solving the problems of racial oppression has been compared to a brick wall that is being taken down brick by brick this analogy is also apt in illustrating the insidious and recidivistic import of gradualism for while one white hand is showily removing one brick from the wall of segregation the other hand is clandes tinely putting up another brick and because this new obstruction is clandestinely placed in effect it is two bricksit must first be detected and established as existing before the task of its removal can begin this is the insidious duplicity of gradualism if an everincreasing series of obstructions are to be placed in the negros path to equality then it is intended that racial equality will never be attained after struggling year after year some negroes have gotten fair employment practice acts passed by their state legislatures only to discover subsequently that these fep laws were being circumvented by the subterfuge of using coded symbols on employment applications restrictive covenants in housing were once quite blatantly explicit but now that legislation has made such restrictions punishable by law the restrictive covenant is implied in legal catchphrases or not stated at all in the gentlemans agreement negro parents have fought long and diligently to have their children integrated into other schools to escape the overcrowded schools in allnegro neighborhoods only to find that the whites move out of the school district to cause what has been termed resegregation if the path to equality is to be an infinite series of obstacles then it is futile for negroes to attempt to surmount them all it is then futile to hope for and place trust in the good faith and cooperation of white people negroes can then only place hope and trust in themselves apart from and distrustful of white people accumulating evidences of perpetual deceit by white people will force negroes into concluding that they cannot succeed in appealing to the conscience of the white man and the nonviolent resistance which has heretofore been characteristic of negroes will have to be abandoned moreover negroes must then give greater emphasis to the fact that their aims must not be limited to gaining equal opportunity with whites because white people are quite inhuman to other whites to be treated equally with whites would still entail an unbearable amount of oppression of the human spirit white people must come to realize how deeply racism has distorted and continues to distort for them the totality of human life in experiences of earliest childhood in things of apparently trivial significance and extending to matters of universal significance the distortions of racism are present throughout the entire range of experience for a white person it pervades nursery stories such as little black sambo or brer rabbit and the tarbaby racism is to be noted in the ideas that a white dress worn by a woman denotes purity while black dress denotes sexiness or immorality angelfood cakes are whitedevilfood cakes are chocolate colored in television commercials washing powders are not to produce cleanliness in clothing it is whiteness that is to be desired and white shoepolish does not take off scuff marks but put on the white while it takes off the black at the other extreme is the distortion of trying to fit the very dignity of god into a white skin myths of christianity imply that god was so pure in his whiteness that he immaculately fathered a son by a virgin white woman it is undeniable evidence of racial madness that in order to give a racial morphism to the supreme being white men would contradict his perfection by imputed acts of fornication and bastardy but these are the unembellished circumstances of the myth no matter how immaculate god was not married to the virgin mary and christ was left to be supported by a foster father joseph to state such a view concerning christianity may be regarded as abominable but the abomination is to be charged to the racial obsession which imputes such shame to god in the crises of school integration in the state of louisiana white mothers turned out en masse with their babies in their arms to spit out epithets and literally spit at the negro children it is a tragic paradox that such mothers were expressing their fears that their children would somehow be scarred or defiled by attending school with negro children poignantly the small white children terrorstricken whimpering in their mothers arms gave testimony that these mothers were themselves scarring the souls of their own children in a way that no child of any kind could do to another child only the involutions of psychic derangement could make a mothers breast so blind to the pain in a child pressed so closely to it much of the rightwing conservative movement or superpatriotism of today is covert racial fanaticism while purporting to be concerned with fighting communism they seek to impeach chief justice earl warren ostensibly for his part in decisions overturning several convictions of communists they would have it appear incidental that earl warren was also chief justice in the supreme court school desegregation decisions of the rightwingers purported to be champions of liberty for moise tshombe in the congo condemning the united nations allegedly for intrusion into the internal affairs of the congo they would have it appear that their condemnation had nothing to do with the united nations having thwarted the conspiracy of white industrialists in the congo that much of archconservatism is actually racial conspiracy in disguise is clearly illustrated by the recently provided record of one such superpatriot namely edwin a walker former general edwin walker was the commander of the federal troops which forcefully brought about integration of schools in little rock arkansas as a white southerner from texas walker seems to have regarded his role in arkansas as a betrayal of his race and when reassigned to a command in germany he sought to atone for this betrayal by becoming a superpatriot after resigning from the army walker embarked on a course of demagoguery which culminated in his activities in oxford there in mississippi he indicated what was troubling him so sorely in his own words i was on the wrong side in arkansas i am on the right side in mississippi the psychotic distortions of racism are resulting in a kind of irresponsible behavior which is critically effecting the ability of this nation to endure the very heart of democracy the exercise of individual liberty is being made into a mockery by the dissemblances of racial conspiracy the dixiecrats in the united states senate have through the filibuster made the right of unlimited debate become an unworkable legislative system and if the right of unlimited debate is to be discarded then democracy will not survive long after rabid southernersgovernors mayors and police chiefs have wilfully and repeatedly violated the law of the land and have said outright to hell with the constitution such treasonable attitudes and insurrective actions are a much clearer and much longer present danger to the overthrow of this government than the threat of any foreign power racism is pervading and becoming compounded in all facets of american life the socalled northern liberals are concocting all manner of legalistic labyrinths and parliamentary chicanery to stymie or fritter away racial progress northern newspapers handle news concerning negroes in a manner that is inflammatory dishonest and shockingly jingoistic they often use the news of the racial troubles in the south to obscure the racial treacheries perpetrated in their own states white liberal writers have published volume after volume on the civil war in the specious attempt to make the confederacy and robert e lee into legends of national glory and heroism only a psychosis focused on racism could attempt to invert such dishonor and shame into legends of national glory and pride to point up and dramatize the national shame and dishonor caused by racial bigotry negroes have suffered arrests beatings firehoses police dogs bombings arson shootings lynchings and murder the great courage forbearance and resolution of negroes has clearly shown that it is not among the minds of negroes that the blind wild hatreds of racism are produced they have clearly shown that it is among the minds of whites that the fears blind hatreds and distorted humanity of racism are produced even the black muslims could not come close to such madness though they have attempted to emulate white supremacy negroes cannot allay or explain away the hatreds and fears of white people only white people themselves can expunge from their minds the irrationalities which so severely distort their lives the groups which can be most easily infiltrated and incited to violence in this nation are groups of rabid racists a foreign enemy of this nation needs only have a white skin and words of racehate to win immediate and complete acceptance into the ranks of the racist mobs the most blindly irrational and the most obsessively irresponsible group of people threatening this nation are the white americans who in order to maintain racial tyranny will shout to hell with the constitution this nation was founded on the belief that all humans are created equal and this belief must not be violated or compromised lest the nation lose its foundations and to limit human worth to the superficial bounds of skincolor does not define a superior kind of humanity it defines something quite the opposite the behavior fomented by racism reduces humans to packs of wolves and never results in respect for the individual liberty necessary for democratic life keeping the record straig by john a morsell the fundamental appeal in my review of lomaxs book the negro revolt was for adherence to simple canons of truthfulness and accuracy in reporting the negro revolt erred grievously and profusely in this regard and my review took sharp note of a number of serious misstatements and distortions it also noted a number of what i called unnecessary if minor errata which i attributed to editorial laxity on the part of the publishers i agree with lomax that his business is writing books not editing them and my reference to these errors made this plain i must add however that most authors whom i know cannot forbear a final peep at the galleyproofs in the expectation that some mistakes may have slipped in and in the hope that what comes out over their names will be as near perfect as possible lomax is quite mistaken incidentally in assuming that i was assigned to write that review i had an advance copy of the book and was thus the first person on our staff to read it it appalled and outraged me and i wrote the review on my own the review has evidently appalled and outraged lomax but his reaction would be more soundly based if he showed any sign of having read it with care he misquotes a reference to himself for example as a selfasserted naacp board member but this is not what i wrote the actual text was selfassertedly an active member and its purpose was to express surprise that under those circumstances he should be so ignorant of what the naacp does i am no longer so charitable however i think lomax does know but that for reasons of his own he prefers to ignore it lomaxs account of the naacps participation in the southern regional councils voter education project is typically garbled it was expected and desired that the association having the most experience in voter registration work should contribute heavily to the design and structure of the project to this end a careful evaluation of the prospectus was made by several of our staff executives and many of the suggestions they offered were subsequently incorporated into the vep plan no final commitment could be made except by vote of our board of directors the plan was not far enough advanced to permit this at the april policy meeting and it was therefore considered at the next policy meeting in september there was no delay intentional or otherwise and lomaxs fictitious quotation from an unidentified board member is gratuitous incidentally lomax professed at the time to believe that huge sums of money were instantly at hand and were being kept out of useful circulation only by naacp procrastination he was also wrong as to the amounts involved they were less than he claimed but being in honor bound by the sponsors to refrain from any public comment we could not speak freely about this or other aspects the sponsors be it noted were perturbed as we were over lomaxs premature radio broadcast which they regarded as mischievous and irresponsible in point of fact it took from september until march to obtain a ruling from the treasury department which would permit the vep funds to be channeled to the naacp and others who do not enjoy the right to receive taxexempt money it would be unfortunate in the extreme if criticism of the naacp were frightened off as lomax suggests continuous criticism is important one would hope it could be constructive even from lomax but any kind is better than none at all at the same time it seems to me the critics should adopt the same attitude and be prepared for countercriticism for correction and for refutation where these are in order this is the essence of healthy debate and it is not helped when giveandtake is interpreted as invidious personal attack a thick skin is still an important requirement for those who would be involved in controversy are negroes pushing too fast by john h marion ecalling her days r y as a canteen director in world war ii margaret halsey tells of a new york soldier who often tried to talk with his southern buddies about the race problem somewhat baffled by the results he concluded wryly that on this touchy topic there were just two southsthe silent south and the screaming south the picture of course was never that simple nor the poor poor southas a beaten slaveholder once sadly called itever quite that sick not all of it anyway but while those two souths of miss halseys soldier are still painfully with us it is today two other souths one white and one negro that now play the dominant roles in the regions ongoing racial dramathis bruising and bitter struggle that is bound to affect americas integrity welfare and peace of mind for generations to come one of these newer souths symbolized for many by the forceful dr martin_luther_king jr consists of the impatient growing host that many fearful whites call those pushing negroes these are the rightsdemanding rebels the picketing freedomriding sittingin demonstrators the wallbattering suitfiling crusaders whose blazing fervor recalls the prayer of the old english preacher o lord we beseech thee to guide us aright for we are very determined on the other side arrayed in cool but stubborn opposition stand many of the souths betterclass whites a privileged raceproud elite who too upset to keep silent and too wellbred to scream are venting some pretty unhappy thoughts in grim and often biting language these are the staunch polite determined conservatives of varying shades of outlook and influence who might be termed the gentler standpatters one snowy moonlit night some months ago as we sat before a big log fire in his pleasant pinepaneled den i had a long quietlyrambling talk with one of these troubled white southerners an attractive keen young business man with a college degree he has generously poured out time money and energy in many kinds of public service for both races he has only pity and scorn for the ku klux klan yet there was no mistaking his deep dismay over the bold new spirit of todays fighting negroes and the weapons they use in the steppedup battle to wipe out racial discrimination i think negroes nowadays are making a big mistake he protested when they let the naacp and all these agitators fire them up into pushing so hard and so fast for their rights dont they see what they are throwing away they can keep on fighting this bitter social war if they choose and they probably willbut by golly it isnt going to make our white people love them any better and countless vexed and anxious whites all across the old confederacy are voicing similar plaints as one of my neighbors warmly put it the worst of it is that all this pushing is undermining good race relations and setting back the clock of progress for a generation or more but is it really as a lifelong cardcarrying white southerner i beg to differ as to their strategy and methods let me say i hold no brief for all that todays militant negroes now do and say their leaders obviously are not infallible just because they are underdogs any more than all rankandfile negroes are wise and good and delightful people merely because they belong to a victimized race being human they can make colossal blunders and sometimes do but with all due respect to the gentler standpatters who are neither wilfully unamerican nor brutally callous i think that on the basic issue they are tragically mistaken i cannot believe as they keep insisting that what negroes ought to prize above all and what all good negroes will prize is a tensionfree community marked by unbroken peacethe peace of swallowed pride and stoic submission i cannot agree that the negros only proper course is to remain unfailingly meek and patient indifferent to his own vital interests and content to leave the easing of his woes to time or education or the evolutionary process as a more or less sacred philosophy now widely frozen into public policy this popular viewhowever understandable in the light of historyis today appallingly expensive and wholly indefensible it is i am convinced the white souths most deadly illusion and perhaps the biggest of all the current obstacles to reasonable racial progress in the united states its basic flaw i think can be simply stated in asking for a brand of patience that for millions of people could mean only one thingrenouncing for life their right to firstclass citizenshipthis wellmeant plea flies squarely in the face of human nature it demands the impossible of educated selfrespecting negro americans no one doubts of course that among the nations eighteen million negroes are thousands who are now domesticated to serfdom what healthy selfesteem they once may have had is now drained away no matter how wretched their plight they now seem willing and probably are to settle for the promise of a new deal for their grandchildren but todays rebel negroes emphatically arent no longer bound by the old slave psychology and scorning to grovel or beg or wheedle they are out to claim their american birthright now where debate and conference are possible they gladly reason and confer where doors are shut they knock on them and if need be they bring suit to pry them open their goal avowedly is not special privilege but evenhanded justice the boon of freedom and dignity and opportunity bestowed not on the basis of color but strictly on merit we have no wish to be treated as favorites they say in effect but we do seek and expectto be treated as people offhand one might think the gentler standpatters would find this demand fairly reasonable they are people of awareness and feeling and many are charming polished and in many respects humane why then their stubborn aversion to granting these aroused aspiring negroes the same unlimited chance at the same good things of life that they want for themselves why this fierce defense of inequality that so plainly lays them open to the charge once made by benjamin kidd against englands th century upper classes of being on the wrong side of the biggest moral and social issue of their time it would take at least a book written by top experts in the social sciences to cope with this question and not even that i daresay would wholly unravel the mystery one prime root of the trouble of course is that for most of these decent whites there has been little or no chanceregardless of the quality of their education in other respectsto get a proper education on the race question even where emancipated welltrained teachers and other leaders have stood ready to impart the truth their lips have usually been sealed by a severely repressive political and social climate in the vast majority of southern classrooms where white youngsters are supposedly prepared for life any honest discussion of the race problem is so firmly tabooed that all but the most independent and daring students become no better informed about it than about the chemistry and physics say of outer space be that as it may the sober truth is that one of the gentler standpatters favorite arguments that within the framework of segregation the white south is doing for negroes now about all that any negroes have a right to expect has now been demolished by a body of facts so impressive that one flouts it only at the risk of writing himself down as illogical undemocratic and strangely if not willfully blind this is not to suggest that all white supremacy policies as framed and supported by the souths more enlightened citizens have been unrelievedly black plainly they havent in one field especially despite all the inequalities and favoritism that flow inevitably from segregation the old paternal system has brought new life and hope to thousands of negroes by opening before them partway at least the doors of learning for generations ever since the populist uprising of the s the souths more humane and perceptive whites have stood firmlyoften against bitter oppositionfor public education for both races nor should the good fruits of this policy be minimized or forgotten not only has illiteracy among the regions negroes dropped sharplyfrom around per cent just after the civil war to less than per cent nowbut growing ranks of negro youth have steadily pressed on beyond the bare three rs to high school college and professional training in recent decades in particular this spreading hunger for knowledge intensified for many by the seminal liberating forces of two world wars has brought forth what now suddenly seems very strange fruit to many on the cosier side of the caste curtain this is a whole new selfconfident negro generation that not only knows not uncle tom but declines even to honor his memory but this it need hardly be said is just the rub today of rip van winkle the storybook fellow who dozed off before and didnt wake up until long after yorktown a thoughtful teacher once remarked that his real tragedy was not that he slept for twenty years but that he slept through a revolution and this precisely has been the tragedy of too many of the souths most highminded and powerful whites this revolution that has so stirred and wakened the younger negroes being almost wholly a segregated revolution has left the more sheltered whites as a group dozing placidly in a corner now that the winds of change are rattling their windows many are slowly rousing and rubbing their eyes but their longconditioned feelings their legendtinted racial sentiments and their gaynineties concept of the negros rightful place and role in american society all these remain pretty much intact and one result is that the myth of the satisfied welltreated negro lingers unabashedly on amazingly alive and kicking even among whites who ought to know betterand often in the highest of circles consider for example a comment tossed off by the honorable ben fortson georgias secretary of state in a talk with a newsweek reporter flatly charging that in the north they dont give a damn about the negro mr fortson declared warmly that the negro gets a fairer shake in the south because white southerners take a personal interest in him here you have neatly poured and mixed one of the souths most potent tranquilizersa mellow draught of agedinthewood folklore that vast numbers of otherwise hardheaded southerners tend to swallow without question but a question embarrassing though it be cries out to be raised what white southerners take what kind of personal interest in what negroes bound by the old habit of lumping all negroes into one big faceless category most whites never put the question that way but that i submit is the only realistic way to pose it for the unblinkable fact is that while some white southerners do take a patronizing interest in some negroes the vast majority take only a jealous political interest in most negroes and normally the main purpose of that concern is to keep all negroes in their place no matter how wellequipped deserving and legallyentitled they happen to be to get out of it now and then to be sure even in these fretful embittered days below the potomac one still hears wellmeaning segregationists earnestly protesting that they love the negro by which is meantmore often than notthat they feel a warm glow of sentiment commonly a blend of gratitude dependence pity and maybe nostalgic respect for some mammyimage for those negroes nearest their families who accept or seem to accept their place yet the very earnestness of these whites and the tone in which they affirm this affection make it painfully clear that they have no real awareness of this social siberia to which their love would banish all negroes merely because they are negroes it is true enough that in those negroes who happen to be their servantstheir cooks maids chauffeurs janitors yard men or other close employeesmany of these betteroff highminded southern whites do take a genuine kindly and often deeply appreciated personal interest and this vintage grace of the age of noblesse obligeso often and so fondly depicted in romantic novels from swallow barn to gone with the windcannot firmly be wholly scorned without it the lot of countless southernborn negroes from frederick douglass and hariett tubman to leontyne price and willie mayswould in some respects have been far more grievous but say all one may in its defense it was never more than a balm a palliative like an icepack on a fevered brow a mor phine shot in the arm it has doubtless done much to soothe the slow burn of segregation it has done nothing to heal it and never will where this benign concern abides among southern whites today it is typically and generally an emotion more condescending than compassionate prompted less by fellow feeling than by a sense i of honor and with its outward expression confined mainly to an occasional tip or bonus a christ mast basket special help in trouble or sickness and maybe a generous donation now and then to the servants church or lodge as for any open active concern for the negros deeper yearnings and aspirationshis simple human urge to be seen and valued as a person his wish for a decent home in a good neighborhood and his frequently flaming eagerness for something more than the scraps and leftovers and handmedowns of a white mans worldthis feeling is not merely rare it is commonly so taboo that whites who dare display it are often pilloried as niggerlovers dogooders communist sympathizers and traitors to their class thus to argue as many whites do that todays negroes ought to quit pushing and let the issue be settled by strictly quiet noncontroversial meansthis is not only to be naive it is to flout a fine old american tradition by demanding in effect that negroes be denied a timehonored weapon of social change that americans of most groups and parties have freely employed since the birth of our republic it seems a fairly safe bet certainly that few if any white southerners who make this plea or white northerners either would care to swallow their own prescription like their forebears from on down they normally feel no call to forego in defense of their own vital interests any valid protest or pressure the situation may demand many would be horrified if anyone suggested they should if their childrens school say got outrageously shortchanged in some crucial allocation of funds they would hardly shrug and say oh well time will take care of things eventually more likely than not they would call on the offending board and start pressing for action now nor could anyone doubt their reaction if the board dared to urge them for the sake of peace and goodwill to calm down and leave the matter to the tender mercies of the evolutionary process as injured parents they might not get what they wanted then or later but they would not like to be called extremists for raising a howl and only a pollyanna could believe that in many such situations anyway their cause would stand a ghost of a chance if they failed to howl whats more to contend that todays antisegregation pressures are coming too soon and too fast is to overlook some hard realities about the way any social order normally moves and changes regardless of how insistently or firmly negroes now push it ought to be clear that no drastic upheaval in the souths racial patterns is coming overnight the cold fact is as countless reform movements in our history attest that it is only by longcontinued boldly dramatized discontent and by vast amounts of seemingly immoderate agitation that any constructive nonviolent change has been achieved even gradually in a social habit as deeprooted as americas intenselyvenerated custom of racial segregation most militant negroes certainly understand this clearly enough they are not blind to the lessons of history they arent out to start a bloody revolution and they know that even in the year both the north and the south in more than a few spots may still be a long way from being remodeled to their hearts desire but if they havent yet fully learned it these fencedin rebels are learning fast that any successful reformer as one of our best historians put it must be a disturber of the peace who often trespasses on forbidden ground and commits assault and battery on human complacency like lawmakers in a fiercely partisan congress these negroes know that they must usually ask for about twice what they hopefully expect in order to get a third or fourth or even less of what they want since politics even in far less controversial areas is always the art of the possible theyve found that civilrights politics is often the art of extracting from defiant and diehard opponents the mere crumbs of the possible and having been taught it by sad experience they know that winning a paper triumph in congress or the courts is often only the prelude to a long and agonizing struggle to make the law of the land the halfhearted practice of atlanta dallas and miami or even of pittsburgh st louis new york san francisco and chicago the odds being what they are so grueling and discouraging a battle to be sure may well sift out the usual handful of sunshine patriots and summer soldiers indeed it already has but to think that the great majority will be frightened off by threats intimidation or reprisals or to imagine that the whole crusade can somehow be stopped by governors piously preaching defiance and insurrection is about like believing that one can hold back the dawn by shaking his fist at the rising sun to adamant southern standpatters gentle or otherwise who say in effect stop fighting our cherished way of life or you may lose your shirt in the process many a fearless negro now seems to be replying i may even lose my life but ive reached the point where i think id rather die that way than to go on as things are and be humiliated to death an englishman gandhi once said never respects you until you stand up to him then he begins to like you and many of todays aggressive negroes i suspect have concluded this is no less true of their present adversaries having as a race been taught to bow and scrape before the white man and having seen this posture bring little if any increase in the freedom and justice accorded them they have now chosen to stand up and assert themselves this may not to be sure make white americans like them any better but neither they seem to be saying could it make millions of whites respect or like them any less as human beings and fellowcitizens anyway and whether most americans turn out to be like gandhis englishman or not one thing these fighting negroes figure seems sure their present mood and stance can hardly fail to make the world at largeeast and west colored and noncoloredrespect and applaud them far more a new life rising despair of from the total disablement to a busy and productive life former basketball star junius kellogg has become a living legend of how the handicapped can ij play a dynamic role in industry and community affairs kellogg was just embarking on an outstanding professional basketball career with the harlem globetrotters when a tragic automobile accident ended his playing days in the accident which occurred near pine bluff arkansas left him in a coma for ten days and when he came to all four limbs were paralyzed he could only move his head for weeks kellogg hovered between life and death at the veterans administration hospital in little rock and physicians believed that only his superb physical con dition attained while a star for the manhattan college basketball team during the early s and later with the globetrotters enabled him to withstand the shock of his extensive injuries because of irreparable damage to his spinal cord doctors told him he would never be able to move his limbs again but an intensive rehabilitation program was soon begun and a physical therapist helped him exercise every joint daily it was a slow and apparently futile procedure until one day he discovered he could move a thumb given this impetus kellogg intensified his efforts until only his legs remained immobilized about six months after the accident kellogg was moved to the kingsbridge veterans hospital only a few miles from the manhattan college campus in the bronx new york at kingsbridge kellogg met an outstanding business executive who channeled his tremendous drive to make a new start in life the businessman was john s woodbridge pan american world airways comptroller who knew what it meant to suffer a severe injury and have to struggle to regain a normal life he had been badly injured while fighting with the french blue devils in world war i and by strength of will helped himself back to health woodbridge grateful for his own recovery knew that once a man was down didnt mean he couldnt make a comeback and with that in view he became a pioneer in the relatively untried policy of hiring disabled persons he had only one criterionthe ability of a person to do a job there is a misguided belief that since there is physical failure there must also be a mental barrier on the part of the man to display his ability woodbridge explains not content with merely hiring the disabled woodbridge also organized a wheelchair basketball team to advertise the dexterity and skill of such men and thats where kellogg came into stay when woodbridge spotted a man with such ability as kellogg in kingsbridge hospital he immediately asked him if he would coach the pan am jets kellogg readily agreed and he has helped to establish the paraplegic team as an international symbol of hope for thousands of handicapped persons around the world kellogg coached the team during periodic leaves from kingsbridge while still undergoing therapy there it was also at kingsbridge that he met another person who would change his life this was a pretty young social worker whose soft words and understanding also helped him to regain his cheer and confidence her name was clementine and kellogg fell in love with her and then he got up the courage to ask her to marry him since i made up my mind to lead as normal a life as possible i wasnt afraid of marriage he says after all marriage is as much a part of life as anything about a year after he entered kingsbridge he and clementine were married they moved into a comfortable bronx apartment selected to enable kellogg to come and go with ease the next big step for him was to get a fulltime job and here his friend woodbridge helped him again one day mr woodbridge asked me when are you going to start working i told him id studied to be a physical education teacher in college and i wasnt prepared to do any other kind of work mr woodbridge arranged for me to take special courses that enabled me to go to work for pan americans accounting department ive been with pan am ever since kellogg suggests that learning to accept ones limitations is essential to gaining maximum potential out of life when youre confined to a wheelchair acceptance is the whole thing in a nutshell he continues youve got to train for a job you can do in a wheelchair obviously some jobs just cant be done by paraplegics but there are many jobs open in offices and professional fields and the situation is constantly improving the main thing is that first you must have the desire to train yourself and then you must qualify kellogg adds employers must also have the willingness to hire disabled persons some employers however go to the other extreme and only hire the handicapped i dont think this is very healthy its best for disabled persons to work in an integrated atmosphere and not in a closed shop where he only encounters other disabled persons since leaving the hospital kellogg has led a normal and active lifeso active that it would put many persons with good legs in rest homes but such activity only seems to give him increasing satisfaction and happiness in addition to his duties at pan americans administrative headquarters in long island city kellogg finds time to fill eight or ten speaking engagements every month there are also the practice and coaching sessions with the jets who play about eight games a month i get a chance to exercise a lot with the other fellows this way so its good for me too he says the jets participate in the international paralympics at london every year and they have captured five world championships in wheelchair athletics the players are versatile and not only participate in basketball but in swimming table tennis discus and hammer throwing also in kellogg led the jets on a tour of brazil and the team played exhibitions before persons winning the plaudits of the south american countrys president for their inspiring exam pie to the disabled everywhere pan american also has flown the team to berlin and israel to demonstrate the abilities of handicapped persons the airlines activities on behalf of the handicapped have brought it numerous awards including citations from the federation of the handicapped and the presidents committee on employment of the physically handicapped last year the paralyzed veterans of america selected pan american as employer of the year for its outstanding record of employment of paraplegics and other physically handicapped persons kelloggs strenuous efforts have helped the airline further its message throughout the world that almost anyone can lead a useful life if you just want to just to make sure he doesnt leave himself with any loafing time kellogg enrolled at new york law school last september and attends classes four nights a week he hopes to be admitted to the bar so that he can take on greater responsibilities at pan american the former hoop star rises at six every morning and rarely gets to bed before midnight i never think about all my activities he says otherwise i might get tired what helps me is that i never worry about what i cant do i find there are so many things i can do so i go out and do them i dont think ive had a bad day since ive been hurt sometimes when ive been a little depressed id look around and see so many people much worse off than myself and that includes people i see walking around and muttering to themselves a handicap can exist in the mind also and not only in the body other disabled persons have given me inspiration one fellow in the hospital never regained use of any part of his body and can only move his head yet he has become a very good artist while painting with a brush held in his mouth that takes a lot of courage and is wonderful to see kellogg travels anywhere people will listen to his message to help the thousands of handicapped who have not been able to resume normal lives under the aegis of the national paraplegic foundation kellogg lectures on paraplegia and helps the organization raise money for spinal cord research his example has enabled others to become leaders in the growing field of rehabilitation many of the jets leave the team to organize other groups so that even more paraplegics can participate kellogg and woodbridge have each made giant contributions in resurrecting human lives guided by a simple philosophy give this man the chance the opportunity of employment not stopping with superficial utterances of commiseration but translating belief in his ability into action and we have benefitted not only the man and our country but most of all ourselves the negro medici by arthur schomburg h e reign of lorenzo t the magnificent t in florence italy connotes the highest expression of art in all its ramifications florence became the treasure house of the loveliest objects in the world long before columbus discovered the new world lorenzo succeeded his father in and for nine years ruled jointly with his younger brother giuliano this brother who was assassinated in left an illegitimate son guilio and this guilio became pope of the roman catholic church in as clement vii however in plain american there was a nigger in the woodpile for long before clement vii was considered for high honors and princely attainmentlong before the smoke slowly poured forth from the chimney of the consistorial chambers of the vatican in rome announcing his successful election to the papacyguilio as a youth had fallen desperately in love with an african venus whom some claimed was a slave others a trusted servant in the ducal household this woman anna bore a child alessandro to the future pope then to save her good name and that of guilio she was quickly married off to the duke of urbino who reigned in the city that gave birth to raphael all the authorities acknowledge these facts his mother was a mulatto slave and he had dark skin thick lips and the curly hair of a negro there is no doubt of this though none cared at the time to contradict the popes assertion that he was the son of lorenzo duke of urbino and as such he has generally been mentioned in history historians contending themselves with saying he was reputed to be so but was more probably clements own son again he is described as alessandro whose wooly hair and negrolike appearance had already caused him to be called the moor yet another has said his mother was a woman of color a tartar slave girl who passed for a wife of a courier trollope the american historian of the florentine commonwealth after looking at alessandros picture discovers naturally that he was of low type but in this judgment he does not agree with the great emperor charles king of spain and emperor of the holy roman empire charles while staying at the medici palace with alessandro relates how pleasant it was to meet the popes relative there must be secreted or pigeonholed somewhere interesting facts concerning this favorite boy before he was taken within the sacred cloisters of the vatican alessandro annas boy was a shrewd lad and was naturally disliked and feared by his ambitious relatives but he became the inseparable companion of pope clement vii when the wheel of life registered his thirteenth birthday alessandro blossomed out with undisputed rights to the distinguished line of the medici succession the fine italian hand of the pope unseen but clearly in evidence was behind his godson and ippolito cardinal and illegitimate grandson of lorenzo had no earthly chance to win the ducal throne on a political chessboard directed by the popes master mind his eminent guardian bestowed great honors and princely gifts on alessandro in he made him joint ruler of florence with his cousin ippolito and under the guardianship of cardinal passerini but the city was in turmoil and expelled its rulers thereupon pope clement made peace and alliance with the emperor charles v and the emperor captured florence in then the emperor graciously assisted the pope in carrying out his wishes to promote the welfare of his son an agreement was signed at bologna and alessandro became first hereditary duke of florence charles v renowned in the military and political horizon of the old world and associated with the wealth and possessions of the new world was power personified and of his children both his daughter margaret of parma like her celebrated halfbrother don juan of austria who crushed the turkish fleet at the battle of lepanto were illegitimate the silent and beautiful monument of alessandro first duke of florence parian marble in the escorial monastery pantheon of the spanish kings describes don juan to the casual visitor as filius naturalis likewise was the daughter margaret who at the age of fifteen was betrothed to alessandro the mulatto medici the barcelona treaty of the marriage provides that alessandro the natural son of clement vii should marry margaret thus dropping all affected doubts on the subject of alessandros parentage the royal nuptials took place at san lorenzo with all the pomp which a ruling emperor of germany king of spain and naples etc could command for his daughter as a bride the pope clement vii head of the catholic church all powerful and mighty most feared in those days of temporal powers ruler over great dominions gave to his natural son generous gifts befitting his station both parents were entirely satisfied and lavished enough money on the event to ransom a kings crown but the throne which alessandro gained was not easy to hold the nobles were incensed at their loss of power to a hereditary monarch confirmed by imperial patent and royal alliance there was no question of color or race but a bitter fight for lost privileges conspiracy was rife centering about cardinal ippolito who was poisoned perhaps by order of alessandro the character of alessandro has been disputed he was true medici patron of art and ruler of men he surrounded himself with distinguished and able councillors vellori guiciardini and valori but he was also a medici in his pleasures and excesses and he was surrounded by medici like his cousin lorenzino who betrayed him and murdered him in his sleep with the help of a hired desperado on january the night outside showed the silvery stars twinkling as the clock ticked away the minutes indoors low and high ecclesiastics gathered hurriedly attendants were there to place the lifeless body of the duke of florence in the tomb of the duke urbino silently with low words they offered prayers for the repose of a soul ushered into eternity the marble slab was gently replaced and every indication of forcing the tomb cleared away the assassins made their escape and for a time consternation reigned supreme in florence cosimo i alessandros cousin and successor caused the traitors house to be destroyed making the place a street for the masses to tread on the wretched regicide four centuries later in fair and lovely florence in the palaces of the medici you may have strolled through the galleries of unsurpassed sculpture artistic objects of infinite beauty and wondered how all these priceless articles could be gathered in this city long before columbus discovered america here where michelangelo exercised his manysided genius where titians canvases resplendent in their charming and beautiful colors view each other with soulful eyeshere in the uffizi gallery is one picture that brings you back to look at it again you will have noticed among the bronzinos remarkable paintings one labelled alessandro look at it again carefully and you will be drawn closer by the fact it is unlike those other white men and rosecolored fair women scattered in those magnificent halls among tombs of their ducal heads do not for a moment think that it is the picture of a menial an efficient porter or a pleasant waiter make no such mistake it is the picture of the mulatto duke i think if this had happened in north america the picture would have been removed long ago and by some plausible excuse relegated to the cellar or entirely discarded but the florentines lived up to the judgment of history the truth cannot be always concealed from the eyes of the world so here is the unvarnished story of the picture a young man of negro descent was married to the daughter of the emperor of germany king of spain and king of naples and he the first duke of florence during days of shadow and adversity florence would seek with devoutness and piety the black virgin of the impruneta to be carried through the streets as an intercessional to help bring back peace and prosperity to the people they had no prejudice against a black face for their patron saint was the color of the first duke of florence alexander dumas pere negro digest july distinguished in french letters and selfacknowledged of negro descent foremost historical novelist of his day if not of all days has left us this apt word let the medici rest in peace in their tombs of marble and porphyry for they have done more for the glory of the world than any king prince or emperor the first negro by leo militelio ntil recently little was y known about bishop i ii j r james augustine healv the first cath s olic negro bishop of the united states when the fact was rediscovered by historians foley albert s sj bishop healy beloved outcaste farrow straus and young bishop healy once again became a prominent figure in the history of the catholic church in america perhaps the interest taken in the bishops life was at first due to the impact this would have upon the problem of segregation in the united states with the study of his life though it does not take long to realize that there is more to james augustine healy than the mere fact that he was colored his whole life is permeated with a deep love for god and his fellowmen regardless of whether these men were black or white irish or french catholic or protestant he was a father to his flock his childrens bishop james augustine healy was born in macon georgia on april his father michael was a catholic irish immigrant his mother mary eliza a slave woman michael always treated his wife as an equal and he loved her very much their marriage proved to be a very successful one for god blessed this union with ten children god was very pleased with the healys because three of the healy boys became priests and two of the girls entered the religious life the healy family lived quietly on their georgia plantation the boys were trained and educated at home at first but michael was soon made to realize that should he die his whole family would be considered slaves by the state of georgia imprisoned and sold one day some of michaels neighbors were taking advantage of his hospitality one of them began to make sly and subtle remarks about his wife eliza the pretty wench who kept house for him when one fellow went so far as to remark that michael had a mighty nice bunch of slave boys who would bring a good price on the slave market michael could take no more jumping up he turned toward his house and yelled mary eliza turn loose the dogs his neighbors instantly disappeared never to return it was this incident that made michael decide to take his boys away from such narrowminded men michael then enrolled james in a quaker school in new york this was the only private school that would admit the boy with the telltale marks of his ancestry it was not long before his brothers hugh and patrick joined him there the boys were not too happy at this school for they suffered much from this friendly brotherhood group james was a very sensitive boy he was deeply hurt by the sly whispers and dirty epithets scribbled on the walls about him and his brothers which he resented more he could not say the meanness of his playmates or the patronizing attitude of his abolitionist schoolmasters exiled from the plantation james found himself an outcast back in georgia the healy plantation continued to prosper michael took part in the social life of the county but only in a business and governmental capacity he knew that mary eliza would never be accepted by the puritanical and narrowminded georgians there was not a catholic church in macon when michael settled there and the phariseesism of his neighbors kept him from partaking in their religious worship michael detested these men who raised a brood of yard children and then sold them into slavery demanding a higher price for them because they were mulattoes about the year while michael was returning from a visit to his boys he met bishop fitzpatrick of boston michael told the kind bishop of the plight of his boys and the bishop induced him to send them to the newly established holy cross college in worcester massachusetts michael was very much impressed by the reception the jesuit fathers gave his boys here it was that the healy boys became catholics it was not long before james reached the top of his class scholastically with his brother hugh running a close second after graduation from holy cross college james decided to go on to the priesthood after confiding all his difficulties and worries to his spiritual father dad fenwick james left for the sulpician seminary in montreal james wrote back to dad fenwick i am just about in the same reputation here as i was at worcester that is a laughing godforgetting rascal good enough when he behaves himself a great lover of theology especially dogma and the classics in june of james received tonsure and four minor orders in his brother sherwood entered the seminary in montreal in this same year james received his subdeaconate and then crossed the ocean to continue his studies in the famous sulpician seminary in paris finally on june the memorable day arrived and james was ordained a priest of god by archbishop sibour in the cathedral of notre dame in paris bishop fitzpatrick welcomed james into the diocese of boston it was at this time that james wrote to dad fenwick the mercy of god has placed a poor outcast on a throne of glory that ill becomes him if i could have been as safe elsewhere as here i should have desired never to show my face in boston james had good reason to fear boston anticatholic feeling ran high there james first appointment was as assistant at the guardian angel home a home for all wayward boys father james and his boys soon became close friends but father james did not limit his work to the orphans he daily visited the wharf tenements here in the irish ghettos he administered to the cholera typhoid and tuberculosis victims such misery was very common among these outcast people it was especially for his work among these people and the love he showed them that he later won the title of best loved priest in the diocese of boston during the year boston became once again the center of the bitter struggle against the catholic church the nativists took over bishop fitzpatrick found himself forced to engage in public political battle if the church were to survive there to help him he appointed father james as his secretary father james threw himself wholeheartedly into this new job which was at the same time a promotion for him the cathedral parishioners were soon spellbound by his preaching which was simple but strong together with the bishop he tramped and went about the slums of boston visiting the sick comforting the sorrowful and afflicted and caring for the many orphans both men were heroic in their work among the immigrants during the cholera epidemic from bishop fitzpatrick james learned how to deal with the noncatholics of boston and new england he saw how they admired bishop fitzpatrick because he was not afraid to make himself heard because he was deeply patriotic and because he constantly invoked the principles of the american constitution when the civil war broke out in father james and bishop fitzpatrick found their fellow priest the rector of the cathedral father hilary tucker a staunch southerner father hilary argued at table with the bishop and father james when father hilary began thundering his views from the cathedral pulpit bishop fitzpatrick removed him from the position of rector and installed father james in his place that father james untiringly fulfilled his added duties as pastor of souls had to be admitted even by his strongest rival father hilary father hilary who remained at the cathedral continually criticized his opponent but was finally won over to father james by his patient charity and friendly attitude despite all the bitter criticisms in when bishop fitzpatrick died father james was appointed to succeed the newly elected bishop john williams as the pastor of the biggest parish in boston st james for the next nine years he devoted himself to this flock and became known as the beloved pastor of st james the story is told of how father james saved his parish during the great boston fire of november just three blocks from his church the flames whipped up and down taking everything in their path firemen were powerless and water was scarce it looked as if the whole south side of the city would be destroyed as the people of his parish frantically began packing their possessions in an attempt to save what little they could father james came out of church prayer book in hand he walked to the corner of summer and lincoln there he stood guard opening his prayer book he began to pray aloud as the flames drew near father james companions left him and soon he stood all alone suddenly as he prayed the wind changed and the fire began to head for the wharf sixtyfive acres of the city were destroyed and buildings were burned but father james parish was untouched by the holocaust when in the year two of bostons neighboring dioceses became vacant rumors went wild that they would probably be filled by the healy brothers father james brother father sherwood also working in the diocese as secretary to bishop williams was picked by some as the next bishop from boston others favored father james because he was much older when news came from rome in february of that james augustine healy was elected by pope pius ix as the second bishop of portland maine the friends of father james were jubilant when bishopelect healy alighted from his coach in his new diocese he was deeply worried as to whether his flock would accept him would any of the clergy resign would the teaching sisters accept a negro bishop these were a few of the many questions that flashed through his mind that morning immediately after his consecration bishop healy began his first visitation of his diocese it was a real missionary journey by train stagecoach buggy boat and on foot the bishop traveled though he was never strong wrote cardinal oconnell he traveled continually over the length and breadth of his vast diocese and as he spoke english elegantly and french very correctly his sermons in both languages of rather high order were listened to by all his congregations with the greatest interest and edification by the time his first summer was over bishop healy had traveled some miles he administered the sacrament of confirmation to about children and had preached more than a hundred sermons it took courage for the new bishop to mount the pulpit in north whitefields church of st denis where he had been publicly denounced by the pastor because of his indelicate blood the incident that brought about this public denunciation is a very interesting one when bishop healy was still a priest of the diocese in boston he often went to maine for his vacations on one such trip he gathered a number of children together to teach them their catechism because the neighboring priest of st denis church who was in charge of the children neglected them when the priest heard about this he was furious father james begged pardon of the pastor and asked him not to make a public denunciation but to no avail when father james became bishop of maine the embarrassed priest resigned his post bishop healy refused to accept the resignation it wasnt long before bishop healy became known as the childrens bishop they ran to him and walked with him one could often see him walking up and down the sidewalk with three or four children each holding one of his fingers during the winter when there was snow bishop healy would take his beloved children for sleigh rides bishop healy regularly took his turn in the pastoral duties of the cathedral parish he would often say mass in the mission churches attached to the cathedral he even helped out in the small wooden chapel of st aloysius for the convenience of the extremely poor who did not have enough money to buy sunday clothes and who were reluctant to attend mass at the cathedral the bishop loved the poor he often rode through town on his horse with saddle bags full of groceries he would stop at the back doors knock and greet a tired housewife he knew all of the poor by name and he always had a greeting for each of them he often paid their overdue taxes and doctor bills and this he did personally for this afternoon relaxation bishop healy would drop in to visit the sick of the parish old mrs murphy told how the bishop upon hearing that her son was sick with pneumonia threw his cloak over his cassock and hiked through the snow and slush in order to visit the sick lad for his daily work bishop healy heard confessions both while at home and on visitation of his diocese a young girl told how she entered the confessional and halfway through her confession she realized it was the bishop she was confessing to she could not go on the bishop in his kind manner tried to help her i cant tell you the rest of my sins she cried in distress the bishop reminded her that nothing revealed in the confessional could ever be spoken of later but replied the girl its something i said against the bishop well now my child what did you say against the bishop ii said the bishop was as black as the devil the girl blurted out oh my child said the bishop dont say the bishop is as black as the devil you can say hes as black as coal or as black as the ace of spades but dont say hes as black as the devil such forgiving charity could not help but endear him to his flock a young boy related how one afternoon he added to his hurried confession and i called the bishop a nigger the bishop drew aside the curtain and said to the wideeyed boy well son is there anything wrong with being a nigger take a good look at your bishop is there anything wrong with being a nigger the boy gulped and answered oh no bishop it has been just over half a century since bishop healy died on august he had suffered much physically from poor health that is why he could understand so well the sufferings of the epidemicstricken immigrants he suffered mentally from the sly and sharp remarks of the narrowminded bigots and this is why he could sympathize with those suffering from similar trials bishop healy was ever faithful to his great mission of sympathy with those who suffer without distinction of race creed or color so that although the world may forget his color it will never forget his charity the meaning of apartheid by dr horace mann bond o be understood we must always remember that the word apartheid is joined to that of baaskap white supremacy it is a theory that is used to justify the complete domination of per cent of the population of a country by a minority of per cent this is the naked and unashamed policy of the national government in every nation the national policy finds in the educational system its ultimate instrument for perpetuating as well as perfecting the national aspiration in south africa this national will is reflected in numerous enactments covering every phase of life the legislation governing education is as elsewhere the ultimate embodiment of policy for today and for generations yet to comeindeed one nationalist leader has projected the state of things envisioned as enduring for two thousand years the basic educational legislation governing the fate and destiny of the vast majority of south africas population is the bantu education act of under this act complete control by the state is made the prerequisite of state assistance to education ordinarily no one could take exception to such a provision it is the diabolical expression of the minority but dominant will to enforce both apartheid and baaskap that adds an utterly sinister quality to the provision other provisions of the act placed its administration under the department of native affairs rather than under the department of education a step that emphasizes the fact that the intent was the perfection of apartheid rather than educational the aim of education was that of developing the individual as a member of society so that he can take his rightful place within the society to which he belongs and where is the rightful place of the african in south african society it is that of a subhuman tender of an inhuman machine given just enough educationrather training to permit him to tend the machine it is that of an agricultural serf tied to the every demand of his white baas it is as a member of an impoverished tribal society condemned to semistarvation in a bantustan where he remains as a convenient reservoir of black labor but let me introduce here the eloquent testimony of chief albert luthuli nobel laureate on the bantu education act bantu education came into effect in it is a specialized type of education designed exclusively by europeans exclusively for africans it is not as were former educational systems in south africa designed simply by adults for children it is not to be judged on the details of its syllabuses though what i know of these is shoddy enough it can be understood only in the light of the declared intentions of its begetters in the context of other legislation enforcing the masterservant relationship and by its effects the principle of school boards is excellent in practice in the present situation it is harmfuland the african communities are never freely represented on them the effect of providing one teacher for a minimum of sixtyfive children is to reduce efficiency the effect in a fastdeveloping society with a growing population of limiting to v million pounds per year the government money contribution to african education for all time is to bleed the poorest section of the community dry and to insure progressive stunting of african education for lack of funds the effect of forcing african parents to choose between school feeding and school building is to impoverish us poorer still under the new system state provision of books has disappeared too and that makes us poorer still even though the government now pays the teachersa mercy denied to us by the smuts government the effect of double sessions taught by the same teachers is to overburden them to the point of exhaustion while the effect of twentyminute lessons is to waste much time of what there is the effect of using only the many vernaculars as media of instruction is to cut children off deliberately and violently from access to outside influences and ideasand the heritage of much of the civilized world this of course brings us to the heart of the matter african children have previously had some small access to the commonwealth of learning they have reached out many of them after its riches and many of our african doctors and lawyers and teachers have proved themselves able to absorb not only learning but western culture in less than two thousand years in south africa this has set up tensions and evoked the threat of encroachment upon the white standard of living and allwhite rule so the door has to be slammed shut hard in the faces of the young generation and a system devised which will recondition us to accept perpetual inferiority and perpetual isolation from western learning and culture to isolate us and to convince us of our permanent inferiority these two motives lie behind much legislation and from the act of union until now and the bantu education act is a major means to this end whatever may be said in favour of certain altered details of bantu education and i do not deny that here and there is to be found a minor improvement or two the overall effect of this system is not educational at all but political it is a tool in the hands of the white master for the more effective reduction and control of the black servant i have quoted chief lithuli at length both because his simple eloquence describes this utterly inhumaneeven monstrouseducational procedure better than i could but also because this great man himself illustrates the paramount importance for a world seeking peace and freedom of keeping open the free flow of culture from the past to the present and so to the future it is also interesting to note that chief luthuli and other leaders in the struggle for freedom in south africa are closely related and indeed frequently indebted to a pipeline that led from the ancient past to the lonely outpost of freedom this man now occupies and americans of african descent fortuitously or in the grand mechanics of human destiny proved foremost as carriers of the flame note here that i am not talking about christian principles nor even of what is sometimes called western civilization chief luthuli himself deprecates the idea when he says the christian faith sprang from asia minor and to this day it speaks with a semitic voice western civilization is only partly western it embraces the contribution of many lands and many races it is an inheritance something received to be handed on not a white preserve what chief luthuli is speaking ibid p of is that idea of concern for the individual and for his worth that flowed out of ancient china and india and out of the mesopotamian valleys on the wings of hammurabis stylus and out of the arabian deserts and the egyptian and greek temples and from the upper reaches of the nile where peasants and scribes and princes were black he is speaking of the very crux of the human matter of the old old notions that were preserved through the ages by moorish caliphs entertaining indiscriminately in their palaces men of learning who were arab and jew african and european and whose genius helped revive a somnolent europe and set in motion that renaissance of learning from which the contemporary culture we call western was manufactured by william barrow the many faces of he also has the unique ability to look the part a normally handsome man of tan color and medium height he canwith the aid of makeuptransform

theatre before he broke through to general roles in plays and the movies he appeared in anna lucasta both in manhattan and in london and starred with hilda simms in a london version of clifford odets play waiting for lefty in recent years silvera has made numerous appearances in tv productions and few tv viewers realize that he is a negro he is master of makeup an art he learned to combat typecasting and he can lighten or darken his skin or add or subtract years with little difficulty the actors success in making a career as an actor without regard to race early disproved the contention that negro actors should be confined to negro roles his access to roles also proved that all producers in the motion picture and television industries are not unalterably dedicated to the practice of typecasting a list of the plays movies and television productions in which frank silvera has appeared would run into pages in almost all of them he assumed a face other than his own it is a mark of his incredible success as a character actor that he is not readily recognized by the thousands of people who have seen and enjoyed his work herron hill by a b andover years ago when y t ii a v we moved to herron i j hill we thought we u were settled for a lifetime in a pleasant neighborhood in central pittsburgh we can drive either to the golden triangle business district or to the oakland civic center in five minutes although ours is a nondescript endhouse in a fourunit row we like it our backyard is small but in march the cardinals tune up and later in the spring we see wrens goldfinches and of course robins an occasional hummingbird drinks from our butterfly bushes and a mantis prayed through one summer on our blue morning glory in good fruitbearing years our neighbor gives us treeripened peaches and he would share his cherries too but the birds strip these before he can gather them fortunately the birds bypass the apples so we have deepdish cobblers and sauce from august until frost we feed the squirrels and rabbits that wander by from the wild hillsides i do the best i can to ignore the garter snakes on sweltering july nights we particularly enjoy our backyard because it is equipped with one very comfortable hammock for my hus band a relaxing beach chair for me and a dependable breeze our backyard measures only twentybyfifty feet and is completely surrounded by adjoining houses but it affords almost the privacy of a country estate a dense vine of hops covering our fence provides a barrier to stray animals or curious passersby now all of this is changing our little eden has been invaded by vermin brought to our street on herron hill by careless neighbors who moved here after being pushed out of the lower hill district now rats chew through the large mounds of refuse from the overflowing garbage cans in our block roaches infest my kitchen bedbugs and mice stage blitzkrieg sorp ties up and down our row on hot days when the windows are open the stench is terrible the rats were the first sign that the neighborhood was changing these appeared promptly when a new family moved into the house back of us after unloading their furniture they immediately patched together a chicken coop from some odds and ends of scrap lumber and wire the materials were donated by an adjoining newcomer who had just as promptly installed a junk business in his backyard several families complained to the city health department about the junk and the chickens which violate our health and sanitation ordinances by the time the city checked the complaint the rats had moved in to stay our rats could be seen day and night crossing our backyard on their way from their comfortable nests in the junk pile to the chicken yard for their necessary nourishment after repeated warnings of legal action by the city the chickens made a slow exit onebyone into the family pot i presume the junk yard is still with us the last time i discussed this nuisance with the city complaint center i gathered that the complaint officer on the other end of the telephone didnt care much what happens on herron hill he seemed concerned as long as he thought our block was somewhere in the allwhite schenley farms section of the hill when he suddenly realized that we are located in the negro herron hill side his tone changed as he cut short my complaint with an abrupt ok ill be out in the years which have passed the junk pile has continued and the rats are snugly multiplying in their comfortable quarters ive been assured that nothing short of a cataclysm will remove these pests once theyve established a good beachhead in a natural habitat such as our adjoining junk yard occasionally we have a short respite from the roaches that infest our house after we put on an allout drive with the modern deadly chemicals developed for jungle warfare during world war ii what worked so successfully in the south pacific gives only temporary relief in our row house on herron hill our hardy pests dont drop dead they retreat for a brief rest in their combat headquarters in the third house in our row the family in this house consists of three adults three children a dog and a paralyzed pet henall crowded into four rooms the fifth room is rented to an elderly invalid who has a prolific cat no wonder the roaches retreat to these quarters to restore their strength for the next attack on us from this same house were also constantly threatened with bedbugs and mice but these are easiest to control fortunately im alerted when theyre on the march my friend maggie not so fortunate lives in the second unit between me and the third family and naturally shes attacked first i am procrastinating about moving out of this row because i once enjoyed it so much but when maggie leaves as shes threatening to do my days here will be numbered its easy to blame our new neighbors for the bad conditions we now live with but i cant forget that they are really victims not culprits they are the victims of pittsburghs poor planning for its urban redevelopment because lowcost housing is unavailable for negro families compelled to move by the demolition of the lower hill district they were forced to purchase property which they cant afford they are meeting their mortgage payments by subletting a room which they need so badly for their own family im annoyed because their crowded unsanitary living affects my household but they are the ones who face the more serious problem meeting the payments on a mortgage for a house which sold for ten years ago im more annoyed that pittsburghs touted urban redevelopment plan demolishes the slums in the lower hill only to transplant the blight to our block in herron hill the family in the fourth unit of our row for instance meets the payments on their mortgage with the income from a weekend barbecue their barbecue is the most tantalizing however illicit small business in our block from friday through sunday we are besieged with the delectable odor of pork basted frequently with an authentic hot sauce roasting on an honesttogoodness pit over slowly burning coals i can resist the temptation to patronize my neighbors commissary because i know the succulent ribs are only a promotional comeon the profitable sales item here is not food but the drinks in a package deal for one dollar customers are served two ribs on one slice of bread a dab of cole slaw and one shot of cheap blended whiskey or gin cut of course the profit must be terrific can you stop after eating only two ribs of real southern barbecued pork i probably would succumb to the enticing ribs if i didnt have the confirmed bourbon drinkers dislike for blended whiskies anyhow so far i have resisted the barbecue and all of the other rent parties or socials which are now so common in our section of herron hill saturday naturally is the favorite day for these socials because they can continue until dawn or even throughout the sabbath if the games are hot gambling is an accepted part of the entertainment and with the excellent food customers can enjoy poker pinochle whist black jack crap or bingo but never bridge bridge is too slow for a fast house cut the quiet of the early sunday morning hours on herron hill suddenly ends when the guests emerge from these festivities after an evening of sport they are in a mood to express all of the emotions known to man some are jubilant others arc depressed by the surfeit of pleasure but all are raucous i have yet to hear their noisy leavetaking interrupted by the soothing sound of police cars arriving to halt the proceedings by a long overdue raid some socials are very quiet guests are carefully screened and personally invited by the hosts to these select affairs held in comfortable or even sumptuous recreation rooms here suave croupiers smoothly remove those who become objectionably loud the owners devious weekend activities which supplement their regular incomes must not taint their reputations as respectable residents of herron hill another small business also operates quietly and efficiently in our block pretty call girls can be seen speeding away in taxicabs after completing their work in the fancy afterhours spot across the street from us the numbers baron who lives next door to this spot is particularly disturbed his young son has asked dad several awkward questions about the girls our baron is scurrying around to find a house in a more conventional neighborhood so that his son can spend his formative years in the proper environment you may marvel at a racketeers strong feelings about a vice which should not disturb him of all people but numbers now is a respectable business in our block welldressed collectors make their daily pickup around noon crisscrossing our street missing few houses they enjoy about the same status as sam the fruit and vegetable huckster who has served two generations of herron hill customers something else also seems to be going on in our neighborhood now without knowing it i probably associate with dope addicts but recently i encountered one whom a policeman with only a cursory glance labelled hophead a stranger to me she rushed into my house through the back door screaming theyre after me she collapsed on my kitchen floor i locked the door called the police then rapped sharply on the dining room wall in an sos for maggie next door maggie rushed over we thought the girl on my floor had really fainted after escaping her pursuers we were positive that the policeman was wrong when they hustled her out to the patrol car after assuring us that she was only hoppedup later in the evening when my husband came home before maggie and i could finish our exciting story he commenced laughing at us for not recognizing a hophead immediately we still werent convinced but on the following dayr a police investigator called confirmed the dope charge and asked for details about the incident shortly afterwards we read that a dope squad had raided in our block and found a considerable cache on one of our unassuminglooking new neighbors as i think of the changes which have taken place on herron hill since pittsburghs redevelopment started i wonder if somehow we didnt get the cart before the horse lowcost private housing for all of the families to be displaced rated the top spot in our plans something happened to those plans and the funds arrived too late to construct the houses nevertheless the demolition of the lower hill district proceeded as scheduled and the evacuated families crowd ed into other areas where housing shortages have existed for a long time for negro residents true city hall as its part in the redevelopment passed new housing ordinances to eliminate tene ments forever and to improve health and sanitation but the rats in my backyard point to ineffectual administration of the statutes also the barbecue and after hour spots raise some doubts about the police vigilance in our neighborhood frederick gutheim who evaluated pittsburghs redevelopment for the architectural forum observed the time has come when projects are probably not enough when indeed the problems they are creating are becoming nearly as important as the problems which existed before and which they have claimed to eradicate clearing the slums in the lower hill cost pittsburgh wonder how much it will cost us someday to clear the slums of herron hill i know its going to cost me a lot to move away the democrat by richard a kalish he japs are nice peoq r pie and all but i just dont think they under d stand american ways gjr j j met n yokohama for an example but first i figure i better tell you some things about the japs that maybe you dont know first off dont ever talk about them as japs its okay between us because you know i dont mean no disrespect but its insulting when you do it right to their faces like this nisei captain i had he was a jap but he was born and raised in los angeles and he was just like he was an american he said to never use the word jap because it was insulting but to always use japanese and i wouldnt want to show no disrespect for them because the truth is that i respect them people except that they should learn more about democracy the japs are a honest people and very kind to children and very polite except on trains when they are real bastards even the women now about this jap girl i was talking about i really liked her she was nice enough to marry although i dont go along with this marrying other kinds of people and having strangelooking kids but the important thing is she was nice enough to marry even if i never wouldnt do it there are lots of cheap women in japan but there are cheap women in san diego and chicago so that dont mean nothing but this girl she was nice i met her when we were sitting at the same table at a little joint for lunch and i couldnt get the waitress to bring me no napkin and she explained to me that i should use that towel they bring you like a napkin stupid of me huh not to figure that out myself and we got to talking and i learned she worked in a department store the takaysomethingorother and i told her how i was in the navy for ten years and had never been married and such and she told me how she liked to talk with americans and learn about america and democracy and hollywood and like that now i seen my chance to do something for democracy no bull i know it sounds like bull but it aint you probably figure i was looking for a quick lay but i can tell you that i can get one of those without hardly trying but a nice girl is different i figured if i could help her learn more about democracy and she could tell her friends and they could tell their friends you know that kind of thing can do international relations a lot more good than speechmaking and stuff so i made a date to meet her for an afternoon movie the next day on account of her father wouldnt let her go out at night and maybe wouldnt let her go out with no american sailor only i never knew for sure i figured we could have something to drink or maybe a sandwich and a coke after the movie and i could talk to her about democrary and chalk up a couple of marks for uncle sam of course at the time i didnt realize how a person can think they like democracy and not understand it like americans do the movie was real good we went to one of those samery things and she explained to me what was happening only it was so simple it didnt take no explaining about some big shot with the front part of his hair shaved oif who gets himself killed and a bunch of guys that work for him swear theyll get even for him and they take years but they kill the guy that killed the first guy and then they give themselves up because they committed a crime and finally they all kill themselves but in an honorable way its like the japs you know to worry about honorable dying and other kinds of dying and the difference is very important after the movie we went out for coffee only it was so strong i couldnt drink it until i put some water in because she really goes for coffee i guess the japs have been drinking tea so long they really dig coffee when they can get it then she asked me about america and i really told her just like i was a damned histcry teacher i told her about the war we fought against england to be free and the war we fought against the south so that the niggers wouldnt be slaves no more and about how california and texas got settled and the pioneers and all this girl she ate it up so we made a date for another movie the next saturday the next time we seen john wayne in that thing about the alamo because i thought it would help her understand american history how the americans fought the greasers and how all the heroes died in the alamo but how america finally won the war and captured texas and afterwards i explained more to her about democracy the way she listened and smiled and shook her head up and down i was positive she understood me shows how wrong a guy can be this time i explained how everyone is equal and everyone can vote if he keeps out of jail i told her every man is as good as every other man like we got jewgovernors and a chinaman in the senate and i think we got a jap in the senate too and thats the next thing to being president i told her about how the navy got jews and italians as officers and that even an american like me has to salute these guys and say sir to them and thats real democracy and i talked about how the old navy used to keep niggers for just certain kinds of job but not the new navy nosir i must of talked nearly two hours and she kept asking questions and her eyes would open big like when i talked about the jap fellow in the senate and i could see she thought a lot better about the us but you know there are little things that you can understand only when you live in a place awhile and no matter how much you explain something a person who never lived there will never understand it well the thing that happened to me with this girl is a real good example of what i mean like im not criticizing her because she didnt know better but it shows what the lieutenant means when he says there are cultural differences between americans and japanese the third time i show up to meet her i can see shes talking to some navy guy i dont get jealous because were just friends and if some guy wants to date her more serious than me why i think he should when i come up to her she introduces me to this guy and goddamned if he isnt a nigger well i smile and shake hands with him like he was anyone else ive buddied with some swell niggers around the base and i dont have that kind of prejudices but when her and i get to the coffee place later i try to explain how nice girls dont get too mixed up with niggers like she should talk with them and be friendly and all because thats democracy but she shouldnt be too friendly or theyll ask her for a date and then she has to say no and everybody gets embarrassed then she tells me the guy already asked her for a date and she said all right and she hoped i wouldnt be mad because i told her i had a girl friend in san diego i told her that so as she wouldnt fall in love with me so i tried to explain to her that dating a nigger just isnt done so she asked me some dumb questions and they were so dumb i couldnt answer them you know the kind i mean she asked if everyone is equal why shouldnt everyone be equal to date and she asked if i was so proud of freeing the coloreds from being slaves why wasnt i proud of being in the navy with them and if niggers were ensigns and petty officers why shouldnt she date one because maybe some day hed be a ensign or a petty officer i guess she asked a lotta other questions but i dont remember because like i said they were the kind of questions you would expect from a foreigner who was just learning about democracy i shipped out after that and i never saw her again but i did get one letter from her she said she wasnt dating the colored sailor no more but he introduced her to another colored guy who was a captain in the air force and she thanked me for teaching her so much about democracy and said she understood the problems of democracy better from me than from all the books she ever read like i say the japs are a very nice people and i got lots of respect for them but there are some things about democracy the little differences that are really big differences that they just dont understand maestro dean dixon by walter monfried he cannot find a steady job in his native land dean dixon the american conductor has been traveling around the world in the last years and winning its acclaim the audiences and critics of most european nations and of israel and australia have been unanimous in their praises of the likable undemonstrative maestro from harlem in recent years he has made nis headquarters in frankfort on the main an ancient cultural and commercial centerthe home of goethe the poet schopenhauer the philosopher and the bankers rothschild there he spends four months a year in the other eight months he speeds by plane or his own little car to the major orchestras of many capitals recently he was appointed permanent leader of the symphony orchestra of sydney australia a metropolis of because of his numerous commitments he will conduct only for short periods in sydney until march when he will begin his first full term the australian newspapers report that the music public there is pleased by the appointment says the sydney morning herald concertgoers became aware at dixons first concerts here last november that he was a conductor worth waiting for unobtrusively commanding on the concert platform with a beat and gestures that were free from unnecessary emphasis he at once established a quiet unforced emphasis over orchestra and audience in his series of mozart concerts he proved himself one of the finest mozart interpreters in the world today he a master of the beethoven idiom his reading of sibelius was as truthful to the character of the music as if he had been reared in finland the birthplace of his exceptionally able wife herself a playwright she is a baroness and the second mrs dixon his former wife is an american there are three dixon children martin long a leading australian critic writes dixon looks like a good man for the task on all counts he is a first rate conductor who already has proved his ability to vitalize this orchestra charles dean dixon the son of immigrants from the west indies was born in new york years ago his mother set him to studying the violin early he loathed the practicing and purposely broke strings she always had a few extras until one day he found and cut them all now you just sit here for four hours doing nothing she ordered the boy sat it out and decided that it was worse than practicing when he was his violin teacher told deans mother your boy has no talent then i guess well hae him become a doctor she reflected and added firmly but hes not giving up his music in his public school music courses he learned to play every instrument of the orchestra when he was in high school he organized an amateur orchestra in a harlem ymca basement its concerts were so well received that the head of the high school music department urged him to become a professional by this time he could play the violin well enough to win a scholarship at the famed juilliard institute and for seven years he studied there and at columbia university he didnt give up his neighborhood orchestra and eventually men women boys and girls were playing with him all for fun friends came to his financial aid and the dean dixon symphony concerts became prideful events in the district ticket sales met most of the expenses persons without money were admitted free an official of the national broadcasting co heard the orchestra and dixon then in his early twenties received some substantial assignments as guest conductor as a leader of the national youth administration orchestra in the s he enhanced his reputation in a few students of city college of new york asked dixon to enroll them in a new orchestra and lead themwithout pay of course that was the start of the amercan youth orchestra a vigorous and proficient outfit which operating on a minimal budget won the nations admiration within a few months it had nearly members and gave to concerts a year some of them in carnegie hall but most of them in the new york poorer neighborhoods where most residents never had a chance to hear good live music we never failed to win an audience dixon recalled as soon as we finished playing the people would crowd around us and ask when will you be back a dean dixon concert was not an ordinary exhibition before going into a neighborhood to give a concert he had the entire community prepare for it he formed a dozen committees to type and mimeograph the circulars and pro grams to distribute the tickets to deliver chairs and other equipment and so on that made it really their event in the s he became an outstanding educator too he taught conducting at juilliard and worked with many young peoples groups on music making and appreciation in he led several hundred wisconsin pupils in the annual summer music clinic at madison he worked them as they had never been worked before and they took it with a smile and a demand for more every day they had to play a new piece the average person isnt going to become a heifetz or rubinstein so why work for six long months on one long masterpeice he argued let him work on many masterpieces do you spend six months reading one book a man of quiet speech and mild manners he had a way in handling youngsters to a boisterous or talkative youth he said play your part from beginning to end alone when this was done he told the lad now you can talk while we play in one of his classes the students took turns at leading an orchestra one youth had an exalted opinion of his own genius and took no care to conceal it just before that boys turn on the podium dixon quietly told some of the players to tune their instruments a half interval below the others the vain boy directed the entire number without noticing the odd harmonies after he was told of the discrepancy in the pitch he was a more subdued student dixon himself has a phenomenally acute ear when he holds auditions he turns his back to the candidates he doesnt care what they look like he wants to know only how they play at times he has told an unseen aspirant that violin youre playingdidnt someone else play it yesterday the answer was yes although he was guest conductor of many leading american orchestras he received no offers of a full time post and in he moved to paris and then to sweden where he led the goteborg orchestra then he began to extend his career over the continent at the venice summer festival of he became a sensation the venetians who came out of curiosity remained to cheer the critic of ii gazettino a difficult man to please praised the dixon technical precision values in his first two years in europe he performed american works by composers such as charles ives and wallingford riegger who were unknown abroad two years ago he was named general director of the hessian radio orchestra of frankfort in his first season the reviewers noted that he caused the musicians to play as if transformed today the end of his long absence from his native land does not seem near but eventually he hopes he will return as the leader of his own orchestra george washington northwest city builder by bob karolevitz he state of washington is named after the nations first president but another george washington son of a slave and jackofalltrades was one of the most prominent and successful pioneers of the pacific ris northwest commonwealth the george washington who came west founded a bustling city made a small fortune in real estate and otherwise conquered the odds which were with him from the start his life ran the gamut of a youthful struggle for education the hardships of the frontier the stinging rebuffs of prejudice and the ultimate warm glow of success fortunate circumstances and his own great courage helped him to break through the onyx curtain of his generation and to achieve the wealth and stature denied to so many other negroes of the th century george was born on august in historic frederick county virginia he received his surname from his fathers master and some students of the past have speculated that the washingtons involved might have been closely related to the gallant general of mount vernon the youngster was just a baby when his father was sold to a new owner and tiny george was taken into the home of mr and mrs james e cochrane this white couple ultimately adopted him a move which later subjected the cochranes to a great deal of ridicule in that era of racial bitterness when the boy was four the cochranes moved to the ohio frontier and later on into northern missouri because of his color young washington was denied formal schooling but mrs cochrane proved to be a better teacher than he might have found in an organized classroom with a tattered bible and old hymnals as textbooks she taught him to read she and her husband tutored him in arithmetic too and before he was george could mentally compute land measures faster than his contemporaries could get the answers with a pencil stub while the tecumseh plot for a grand western indian alliance had been foiled years before by william henry harrison at tippecanoe george washington grew up in an atmosphere of ready alert jim cochrane saw to it that he became an expert with a rifle because the possibilities of hostile indian attack were always imminent in bloomington mo cochrane operated a grist mill and a whiskey distillery later he opened a sawmill not only did george washingtons alert teenage mind soak up the rudiments of these trades but he also learned bricklaying and tailoring when he was george decided to strike out on his own after a short time in illinois during which he failed to make his fortune in the real estate business washington rented a sawmill near the present city of st joseph mo it was hereaway from the cochranesthat he first learned the real meaning of prejudice he sold some goods to a white man named jeremiah coyle whose note he accepted in good faith when the note came due coyle refused to pay and washington sued coyle then took advantage of an earlier law and had george arrested on the grounds that as a free man of color he had no rights in the state of missouri jim cochrane heard of his adopted sons plight and immediately circulated a petition requesting the rights of citizenship for the young man in the legislature granted those rightsless that of holding public office in the meantime the mill he had operated flooded out so washington purchased equipment to make whiskey then the legislature which had so recently aided him passed another law this one prohibiting a person of color from manufacturing handling or selling spirituous liquors washington disgustedly moved to quincy ill already severely irritated by the limitations placed on him in missouri he learned that the illinois legislature had just passed a law requiring any colored person entering that state with intentions of staying must post a bond of to guarantee his good behavior this was more than george could stand he went directly to the cochranes and told them that he was going to oregon to find a place in the world if there was any where a negro would be treated as a man his foster parents decided that theyd go too with a wagon and a light carriage four oxen two span of horses and several canadian ponies they went first to council bluffs iowa on may they set out with a wagon train on the long overland journey a story has it that on the trip a triggerhappy renegade in their party shot an indian squaw a war party threatened annihilation of the wagon train unless the villain was surrendered being at the mercy of the indians the travelers had little choice but to hand over the slayer and then they watched aghast as the indians skinned him alive and threw his body in a fire the journey took days before the party crossed the cascade range at barlows pass and arrived in oregon city washington helped the cochranes establish a home and then took a job cutting timber for a month the rigors of the trip the new climate and the hard work finally caught up with the yearold frontiersman and he fell desperately ill again it was the cochranes who came to his rescue and nursed him back to health with george strong again the family moved northward to cowlitz landing in the present state of washington again the young man helped his foster parents get settled before he looked for a home of his own his search finally took him to a verdant spot where the skookumchuck river joins the chehalis this had been an indian summer home and burial grounds and from his earlier real estate experience washington had learned that the juncture of two rivers made an ideal spot for settlement he immediately staked a claim for acres then he learned that prejudice had marched westward with him the oregon legislature had approved a law making the settlement of negroes and mulattos in the territory illegal so jim cochrane filed on washingtons land to protect it for him together they raised cattle and operated an inn and a river ferry in the same year that oregon became a state jim cochrane died only the death of mrs cochrane two years later affected washington more deeply they had devoted their lifetime to the care of a deserted negro youngster and the recipient of their love and devotion recognized all too well the sacrifices their choice in life had entailed before cochrane died george had given him for the original claim when the laws of washington territory created in did not bar ownership by a negro he later added more acres to the original holdings by filing a claim and paying an acre with his foster parents gone washington lived alone for several yearsfarming lumbering and improving his land when he was he met and married his first wife an attractive widow who had been born of negro and jewish parents this was a happy union of years before she died in meanwhile the two of them began to reap the rewards of georges foresight by the northern pacific railroad had edged northward to the chehalis river and the homestead which george washington had so carefully selected lay right astride the line on january washington appeared before the territorial auditor and filed his intentions of laying out a new town he started modestly with four square blocks which he platted into lots ft by ft these he sold for a lot at the same time making each purchaser agree to erect a building on the property at a cost of no less than to counter the rivalry of other young towns in the territory washington who controlled all the ideal property set aside park land and two acres for a cemetery he dedicated foot streets and foot alleys for public use and he gave choice building lots for churches of his holdings he reserved acres for his home with mary jane and her son stacey to make the town of centerville more attractive to new residents washington later doubled the size of his lots and the little village began to grow by the time washington became a state in the population was nearing a thousand two years later george washington had sold his th lot and combined with his other incomes he had amassed meanwhile the residents of washingtons town decided that they didnt like the name centerville primarily because it was too easy to confuse with other western towns of the same name a public meeting was called and a teamster newly arrived from centralia ill convinced the citizens that they should adopt the name of his former hometown in following the death of his first wife washington married charity brown a year later his only child george cleveland washington was bom soon afterwards the couple separated and the yearold father assumed the additional task of raising a son george washington had always worked hard and even though he had a great deal of money by the standards of the times he continued to do manual labor when it was called for he had personally hewn the timbers for the centralia baptist church to which he belonged and he worked on numerous construction projects around the busy little city and then came the panic of like other young western settlements centralia took on the aura of a ghost town the simmons iron works and the lumber mills shut down or curtailed employment severely to save the town george washington became a oneman relief society he made wagon trips to portland and brought back rice flour and sugar by the ton from the packing plant in chehalis he purchased large quantities of side bacon and lard as a man who could still make a shirt in an hourandahalf including buttons and buttonholes he worked to provide clothing and shoes for his less fortunate neighbors he lent considerable sums of money without interest and with no terms for repayment but mainly he provided work so that his beneficiaries did not accept his offerings as pridedamaging charity but as an exchange for a days labor washington further saved the town from bankruptcy or absentee ownership by buying up property which went on the auction block his faith in his city paid off in when the tide changed not only for centralia but for george washington too by the turn of the century he was a wealthy and respected citizen of the state alert and always planning for the future in spite of his age washington was active in business until august of then in an accident not uncommon in those days he was thrown from his buggy by a runaway horse and injured critically three weeks later on august he died in his th year his funeral was the biggest in centralias history as the mayor proclaimed a day of mourning services were help in the baptist church he helped to build on the ground he had donated he was buried in the cemetery he had deeded to the city beside him were the bodies of james cochrane and his wife whom george had thoughtfully moved to the family plot with the help of his devoted foster parents washington had risen above the limitations set for his race in an era of prejudice and injustice today he is virtually a legendary figure in his city and his adopted state stories are told about his strong aversion to paper money which grew folks say out of the time he saw a bill blow into a roaring fireplace after that he dealt only in gold and silver once he supposedly withdrew a wheelbarrow full of money from a local bank when he became fearful of the banks soundness it is still rumored that he buried the money somewhere around centralia and never told anyone of the location in his later years he was still sharpeyed and adept with a rifle and could riddle a tin can tossed into the air with a revolver his only vanity consisted of two wigs a brown one for week days and a black one for sunday though his stature in his home community was great he did not entirely escape the reminders of his lowly birth today one of centralias streets grew out of a conflict with one of his neighbors james tullis a southerner tullis vowed that his fence would never touch washingtons so he erected it six feet inside his own property not to be outdone george also built his fence six feet from the plat line and the resultant foot spite strip became known as tullis lane george washington pioneer builder and entrepreneurmight have been handicapped by his borrowed name his color and his backwoods education but he chose to accent the positive today a thriving city stands as a living monument to his long struggle against moralecracking odds hed have preferred that to statues by dwight macdonald his significantly titled the affluent society pro fessor j k galbraith states that poverty in this country is no longer a massive affliction but more nearly an after thought dr galbraith is a humane critic of the american capitalist system and he is generously indignant about the con tinued existence of even this nonmassive and afterthoughtish poverty but the interesting thing about his pronouncement aside from the fact that it is inaccurate is that it was generally accepted as obvious for a long time now almost everybody has assumed that because of the new deals social legislation and more inportantthe prosperity we have enjoyed since mass poverty no longer exists in this country dr galbraith states that our poor have dwindled to two hardcore categories one is the insular poverty of those who live in the rural south or in depressed areas like west virginia the other category is case poverty which he says is commonly and properly related to such characteristics of the individuals so afflicted as mental deficiency bad health inability to adapt to the discipline of modern economic life excessive procreation alcohol insufficient education he reasons that such poverty must be due to individual defects since nearly everyone else has mastered his environment this proves that it is not intractable without pressing the similarity of this concept to the social darwinism whose fallacies dr galbraith easily disposes of elsewhere in his book one may observe that most of these characteristics are as much the result of poverty as its cause dr galbraiths error is understandable and common last april the newspapers reported some exhilarating statistics in a department of commerce study the average family income increased from in to in these figures are calculated in current dollars as are all the others i shall cite but the papers did not report the fine type so to speak which showed that almost all the recent gain was made by families with income of over and that the rate at which poverty is being eliminated has slowed down alarmingly since only the specialists and the statisticians read the fine type which is why illusions continue to exist about american poverty now michael harrington an alumnus of the catholic worker and the fund for the republic who is at present a contributing editor of dissent and the chief editor of the socialist party biweekly new america has written the other america poverty in the united states macmillan in the admirably short space of under two hundred pages he outlines the problem describes in imaginative detail what it means to be poor in this country today summarizes the findings of recent studies by economists and sociologists and analyzes the reasons for the persistence of mass poverty in the midst of general prosperity in the last year we seem to have suddenly awakened rubbing our eyes like rip van winkle to the fact that mass poverty persists and that it is one of our two gravest social problems the other is related while only eleven per centof our population is nonwhite twentyfive per cent of our poor are what is poverty it is a historically relative concept first of all there are new definitions in america of what man can achieve of what a human standard of life should be mr harrington writes those who suffer levels of life well below those that are possible even though they live better than medieval knights or asian peasants are poor poverty should be defined in terms of those who are denied the minimal levels of health housing food and education that our present stage of scientific knowledge specifies for life as it is now lived in the united states his dividing line follows that proposed in recent studies by the united states bureau of labor statistics a year for a family of four and for an individual living alone all kinds of income are included such as food grown and consumed on farms this is the cutoff line generally drawn today mr harrington estimates that between forty and fifty million americans or about a fourth of the population are now living in poverty not just below the level of comfortable living but real poverty in the oldfashioned sense of the wordthat they are hard put to it to get the mere necessities beginning with enough to eat this is difficult to believe in the united states of but one has to make the effort and it is now being made the extent of our poverty has sud denly become visible the same thing has happened in england where workingclass gains as a result of the labour partys post welfare state blinded almost everybody to the continued existence of mass poverty it was not until professor richard m titmuss of the london school of economics published a series of articles in the new statesman last fall based on his new book income distribution and social change allen unwin that even the liberal public in england became aware that the problem still persists on a scale that is statistically significant as the economists put it the limits of statistics statistics on poverty are even trickier than most for example age and geography make a difference there is a distinction which cannot be rendered arithmetically between poverty and low income a childless young couple with a year is not poor in the way an elderly couple might be with the same income the young couples statistical poverty may be temporary inconvenience if the husband is a graduate student or a skilled worker there are prospects of later affluence or at least comfort but the old couple can look forward only to diminishing earnings and increasing medical expenses so also geographically a family of four in a small town with a year may be better off than a like family in a citylower rent no bus fares to get to work fewer occasions or temptations to spend money even more so with a rural family although allowance is made for the value of the vegetables they may raise to feed themselves it is impossible to calculate how much money they dont spend on clothes say or furniture because they dont have to keep up with the joneses lurking in the crevices of a city like piranha fish in a brazilian stream are numerous tempting opportunities for expenditure small but voracious which can strip a budget to its bones in a surprisingly short time how many poor it is not therefore surprising to find that there is some disagreement about just how many millions of americans are poor the point is that all recent studies agree that american poverty is still a mass phenomenon thus the commerce departments april report estimates there are families and unattached individuals with incomes of less than how many of the latter are there poverty and deprivation see page puts the number of single persons with under at let us say that in the under there are single personsthe proportion of unattached individuals tends to go down as income rises this homemade estimate gives us familes with incomes of under figuring the average american family at thiee and a half personswhich it isthis makes individuals in families or a grand total if we add in the unattached individuals with under a year of americans now living in poverty which is close to a fourth of the total population the reason dr galbraith was able to see poverty as no longer a massive affliction is that he used a cutoff of which even in when it was adopted in a congressional study was probably too low the cio argued for and in when the affluent society appeared was simply fantastic the model postwar budgets drawn up in by the bureau of labor statistics to maintain a level of adequate living give a concrete idea of what poverty means in this countryor would mean if poor families lived within their income and spent it wisely which they dont dr kolko summarizes the kind of living these budgets provide three members of the family see a movie once every three weeks and one member sees a movie once every two weeks there is no telephone in the house but the family makes three pay calls a week they buy one book a year and write one letter a week the father buys one heavy wool suit every two years and a light wool suit every three years the wife one suit every ten years or one skirt every five years every three or four years depending on the distance and time involved the family takes a vacation outside their own city in the family spent a total of to on all types of home furnishings electrical appliances and laundry equipment the family eats cheaper cuts of meat several times a week but has more expensive cuts on holidays the entire family consumes a total of two fivecent ice cream cones one fivecent candy bar two bottles of soda and one bottle of beer a week the family owes no money but has no savings except for a small insurance policy one other item is included in the bls maintenance budget a new car every twelve to eighteen years this is an ideal picture drawn up by social workers of how a poor family should spend its money but the poor are much less provident installment debts take up a lot of their cash and only a statistician could expect an actual live woman however poor to buy new clothes at intervals of five or ten years also one suspects that a lot more movies are seen and icecream cones and bottles of beer are consumed than in the spartan ideal but these necessary items are had only at the cost of displacing other itemsnecessary so to speakin the bls budget the conference on economic progresss poverty and deprivation deals not only with the poor but also with another large section of the underprivileged which is an american euphemism almost as good as senior citizen namely the persons whose family income is between and and the singles who have from to the authors define deprivation as above poverty but short of minimum requirements for a modestly comfortable level of living they claim that americans or almost half the population live in poverty or deprivation one recalls the furor roosevelt aroused with his onethird of a nation illhoused illclad illnourished but the political climate was different then the distinction between a family income of poverty and deprivation is not vivid to those who run thingsthe per cent whose incomes are between and and the per cent of the topmost top dogs who get or more these two minorities sizable enough to feel they are the nation have been as unaware of the continued existence of mass poverty as this reviewer was until he read mr harringtons book they are businessmen congressmen judges government officials politicians lawyers doctors engineers scientists editors journalists and administrators in colleges churches and foundations since their education income and social status are superior they if anybody might be expected to accept responsibility for what the constitution calls the general welfare they have not done so in the case of the poor and they have a good excuse it is becoming harder and harder simply to see the onefourth of our fellowcitizens who live below the poverty line the poor are increasingly slipping out of the very experience and consciousness of the nation mr harrington writes if the middle class never did like ugliness and poverty it was at least aware of them across the tracks was not a very long way to go now the american city has been transformed the poor still inhabit the miserable housing in the central area but they are increasingly isolated from contact with or sight of anybody else living out in the suburbs it is easy to assume that ours is indeed an affluent society clothes make the poor invisible too america has the bestdressed poverty the world has ever known it is much easier in the united states to be decently dressed than it is to be decently housed fed or doctored many of the poor are the wrong age to be seen a good number of them are sixtyfive years of age or better an even larger number are under eighteen and finally the poor are politically invisible they are without lobbies of their own they put forward no legislative program as a group they are atomized they have no face they have no voice only the social agencies have a really direct involvement with the other america and they are without any great political power forty to fifty million people are becoming increasingly invisible these invisible people fall mostly into the following categories some of them overlapping poor farmers who operate per cent of the farms and get per cent of the farm cash income migratory farm workers unskilled unorganized workers in offices hotels restaurants hospitals laundries and other service jobs inhabitants of areas where poverty is either endemic peculiar to a people or district as in the rural south or epidemic prevalent among a community at a special time and produced by some special causes as in west virginia where the special cause was the closing of coal mines and steel plants negroes and puerto ricans who are a fourth of the total poor the alcoholic derelicts in the bigcity skid rows the hillbillies from kentucky tennessee and oklahoma who have migrated to midwestern cities in search of better jobs and finally almost half our senior citizens the wrong color the most obvious citizens of the other america are those whose skins are the wrong color the folk slogans are realistic last to be hired first to be fired and if youre black stay back there has been some progress in the nonwhite workers wage averaged per cent of the white workers by it had climbed to per cent a famous victory but the nonwhites still average only slightly more than half as much as the whites even this modest gain was due not to any rooseveltian or trumanian social reform but merely to the fact that for some years there was a war on and workers were in demand whether black white or violet by the nonwhites had achieved most of their advanceto per cent of white earnings which means they have gained in the last fifteen years just per cent the least obvious poverty affects our senior citizensthose over sixtyfive mr harrington estimates that half of them live in poverty and he thinks they are even more atomized and politically helpless than the rest of the other america he estimates that onefourth of the unrelated individuals among them or a million persons have less than a year which is about what is allotted for food alone in the department of agricultures minimumsubsistence budget the average american family now spends only per cent of its income for foodan indication of the remarkable prosperity we are all enjoying except for onequarter of us one can imagine or perhaps one cant what it would be like to live on a year or a week it is only fair to note that most of our senor citizens do better the average per capita income of those over sixtyfive is now estimated to be slightly over a week that is a year the aged poor have two sources of income besides their earnings or savings one is contributions by relatives a white house conference report put this at per cent of income which works out to a week for an income of and the aged poor all have less than that the other is social security whose benefits in averaged a week even this modest sum is more than any of the under got since payments are proportionate to earnings and the poor of course earned less than the rest a quarter of them and those in general the neediest are not covered by social security the last resort is relief and mr harrington describes most vividly the humiliations the poor often have to put up with to get that the whole problem of poverty and the aged is especially serious today because americans are living longer in the first half of this century life expectancy increased years for men and years for women and between and the oversixtyfive group increased twice as fast as the population as a whole the worst part of being old and poor in this country is the loneliness mr harrington notes that we have not only racial ghettos but geriatric ones in the cheap roominghouse districts of large cities he gives one peculiarly disturbing statistic onethird of the aged in the united states some or more human beings have no phone in their place of residence they are literally cut off from the rest of america ernest hemingways celebrated deflation of scott fitzgeralds romantic notion that the rich are different somehowyes they have moneydoesnt apply to the poor they are different in more important ways than their lack of money as mr harrington demonstrates emotional upset is one of the main forms of the vicious circle of impoverishment the structure of the society is hostile to these people the poor tend to become pessimistic and depressed they seek immediate gratification instead of saving they act out once this mood this unarticulated philosophy becomes a fact society can change the recession can end and yet there is no motive for movement the depression has become internalized the middle class looks upon this process and sees lazy people who just dont want to get ahead people who are much too sensitive to demand of cripples that they run races ask of the poor that they get up and act like everyone else in the society the poor are not like everyone else they think and feel differently they look upon a different america than the middle class looks upon the poor are also different in a physical sense they are much less healthy according to poverty and deprivation the proportion of those disabled or limited in their major activity by chronic ill health rises sharply as income sinks in reasonably welloff families and up per cent are so disabled in reasonably poor families to the proportion doubles to per cent and in unreasonably poor familes under it doubles again to per cent an obvious cause among others for the very poor being four times as much disabled by chronic ill health as the welltodo is that they have much less money to spend for medical care in fact almost nothing this weighs with special heaviness on the aged poor during the fifties mr harrington notes all costs on the consumer price index went up by per cent but medical costs that terrible staple of the aged went up by per cent hospitalization rose by per cent and group hospitalization costs blue cross premiums were up by per cent the defeat of medicare this last figure is particularly interesting since blue cross and such plans are the amas alternative to socialized medicine or rather to the timid fumblings toward it that even our most liberal politicians have dared to propose such figures throw an unpleasant light on the senates rejection of medicare the defeat was all the more bitter because in the usual effort to appease the conservatives with the usual lack of successonly five republicans and only four southern democrats voted pro the bill was watered down in advance not until he had spent of his own moneywhich is per cent of the annual income of some aged poorwould a patient have been eligible and the original program included only people already covered by social security or railroad retirement pensions and excluded the neediest of all aged poor who are left out of both these systems mental as well as physical illness is much greater among the poor even though our complacent cliche is that nervous breakdowns are a prerogative of the rich because the poor cant afford them they cant but they have them anyway this bit of middleclass folklore should be laid to rest by a study made in new haven social class and mental illness by august b hollingshead and frederick c redlich wiley they found that the rate of treated psychiatric illness is about the same from the rich down through decently paid workersan average of per but in the bottom fifth it shoots up to per there is an even more striking difference in the kind of mental illness of those in the four top in come groups who had undergone psychiatric treatment per cent had been treated for neurotic problems and per cent for psychotic disturbances in the bottom fifth the treated illnesses were almost all psychotic per cent this shows there is something to the notion that the poor cant afford nervous breakdownsthe milder kind that issince the reason the proportion of treated neuroses among the poor is only per cent is that a neurotic can keep going after a fashion but the argument cuts deeper the other way the poor go to a psychiatrist or more commonly are committed to a mental institution only when they are completely unable to function because of psychotic symptoms therefore even that nearly threefold increase in mental disorders among the poor is probably an underestimate the main reason the american poor have become invisible is that since their numbers have been reduced by twothirds astounding as it may seem the fact is that president roosevelts onethird of a nation was a considerable understatement over twothirds of us then lived below the poverty line as is shown by the tables that follow but today the poor are a minority and minorities can be ig nored if they are so heterogeneous that they cannot be organized when the poor were a majority they simply could not be overlooked poverty is also hard to see today because the middle class to has vastly increasedfrom per cent of all families in to a nearmajority per cent today that mass poverty can persist despite this rise to affluence is hard to believe or see especially if one is among those who have risen two tables in poverty and deprivation summarize what has been happening in the last thirty years they cover only multipleperson families all figures are converted to dollars and the income is before taxes i have omitted for clarity all fractions the first table is the percentage of families with a given income under to to to over several interesting conclusions can be drawn from these tables the new deal didnt do anything about poverty the under families in were per cent of the total population which was slightly more than the figure of per cent the war economy hot and cold did do something about poverty between and the proportion of all families who were poor reduced from per cent to per cent if the percentage of under families decreased by twothirds between and their share of the national income dropped a great deal morefrom per cent to per cent the welltodo to have enormously increased from per cent of all families in to per cent today the rich and over have also multipliedfrom to per cent but it should be noted that the very rich according to another new study the share of top wealthholders in national wealth by robert j lampman princeton have experienced a decline he finds that the top per cent of wealthholders owned per cent of the national wealth in and own only per cent today the reduction of poverty has slowed down in the six years the number of poor families declined per cent but in the following seven years only per cent the economic stasis that set in with eisenhower and that still persists under kennedy was responsible this stagnation however did not affect the over families who increased from per cent to per cent between and in the new york times magazine for last november th herman p miller of the bureau of the census wrote during the forties the lowerpaid occupations made the greatest relative gains in average income laborers and service workers had increases of about and professional and managerial workers the highest paid workers of all had the lowest relative gains but in the last decade the trend has been reversed laborers and service workers have gained while professionalmanagerial workers have gained this is because in the wartime forties the unskilled were in great demand while now they are being replaced by machines automation is today the same kind of menace to the unskilledthat is the poorthat the enclosure movement was to the british agricultural population centuries ago the facts show that our social revolution ended nearly twenty years ago mr miller concludes yet important segments of the american public many of them highly placed government officials and prominent educators think and act as though it were a continuing process the post decrease in poverty was not due to the policies or actions of those who are not poor those in positions of power and responsibility the war economy needed workers wages went up and the poor became less poor when economic stasis set in the rate of decrease in poverty slowed down proportionately and it is still slow kennedys efforts to get the country moving again has been unsuccessful possibly because he has despite the suggestions of many of his economic advisers not yet advocated the one big step that might push the economy off dead center a massive increase in government spending this would be politically courageous perhaps even dangerous because of the superstitious fear of deficit spending and an unbalanced federal budget american folklore insists that a governments budget must be arranged like a private familys walter lippmann wrote after the collapse of the stock market last spring there is mounting evidence that those economists were right who told the administration last winter that it was making the mistake of trying to balance the budget too soon it will be said that the budget is not balanced it shows a deficit in fiscal of billion but the budget that matters is the department of commerces income and product accounts budget nobody looks at it except the economists but while the administrative budget is necessary for administration and is like a mans checkbook the income budget tells the real story it shows that at the end of the outgo and ingo accounts will be virtually in balance with a deficit of only about half a billion dollars thus in reality the kennedy administration is no longer stimulating the economy and the economy is stagnating for lack of stimulation we have one of the lowest rates of growth among the advanced industrial nations of the world one shouldnt be hard on the president franklin roosevelt a more daring and experimental politician at least in his domestic policy listened to the american disciples of j m keynes in the early new deal years and unbalanced his budgets with splendid results but by he had lost his nerve he cut back government spending and there ensued the recession from which the economy recovered only when war orders began to make up for the deficiency in domestic buying power poverty and deprivation estimates that between and the annual growth rate of our economy was only per cent per annum contrasted with an estimated per cent required to maintain utilization of manpower and other productive resources the poor who always experience the worst the first understand quite personally the meaning of that dry statistic as they understand kiplings the toad beneath the harrow knowsexactly where each toothpoint goes they are also most intimately acquainted with another set of statistics the steady postwar rise in the unemployment rate from per cent in to per cent in to per cent in to over per cent in the tory government is worried because british unemployment is now at its highest point for the last three years this point is per cent which is less than our lowest rate in the last fifteen years its not that public opinion doesnt become aroused every now and then but the arousement never leads to much it was aroused twentyfour years ago when john steinbeck published the grapes of wrath but mr harrington reports that things in the imperial valley are still much the same low wages bad housing no effective union public opinion is too public that is too general of its very nature it can have no sustained interest in california agriculture the only groups with such a continuing interest are the workers and the farmers who hire them once public opinion ceased to be aroused the battle was again between the two antagonists with a real personal stake in the outcome and there was no question about which was stronger so with the rural poor in general in the late fifties the average annual wage for white male american farm worker was slightly over women children negroes and mexicans got less one recalls edward r murrows celebrated television program about these people harvest of shame once more everybody was shocked but the harvest is still shameful one also recalls that mr murrow after president kennedy had appointed him head of the united states information agency tried to persuade the bbc not to show harvest of shame his argument was that it would give an undesirable image of america to foreign audiences there is a monotony about the injustices suffered by the poor that perhaps accounts for the lack of interest the rest of society shows in them everything seems to go wrong with them they never win its just boring address unknown public housing turns out not to be for them the housing act authorized new units of lowcost housing in the following four years twelve years later in the aflcio proposed units to complete the lagging program the kennedy administration ventured to recommend to congress thus instead of lowcost units by the poor will get if they are lucky by and they are more likely to be injured than helped by slum clearance since the new projects usually have higher rents than the displaced slumdwellers can afford there has been no dearth of governmentfinanced middle income housing since these refugees from the bulldozers for the most part simply emigrate to other slums they also become invisible mr harrington notes that half of them are recorded as address unknown several years ago charles abrams who was new york state rent administrator under harriman and who is now president of the national committee against discrimination in housing summed up what he had learned in two decades in public housing once social reforms have won tonal appeal in the public mind their slogans and goalsymbols may degenerate into tools of the dominant class for beleaguering the minority and often for defeating the very aims which the original sponsors had intended for their reforms and this is not the end of tribulation the poor who can least afford to lose pay because of ill health lose the most a national health survey made a few years ago found that workers earning under a year had twice as many restrictedactivity days as those earning over although they are the most in need of hospital insurance the poor have the least since they cant afford the premiums only per cent of poor families have it as against per cent of all families it should be noted however that the poor who are war veterans can get free treatment at government expense in veterans administration hospitals the poor actually pay more taxes in proportion to their income than the rich a recent study by the tax foundation estimates that per cent of incomes under goes for taxes as against per cent of the income of families earning five to seven times as much sales and other excise taxes are largely responsible for this curious statistic it is true that such taxes fall impartially on all like the blessed rain from heaven but it is a form of egalitarianism that perhaps only senator goldwater can fully appreciate the final irony is that the welfare state which roosevelt erected and which eisenhower no matter how strongly he felt about it didnt attempt to pull down is not for the poor either agricultural workers are not covered by social security nor are many of the desperately poor among the aged such as unrelated individuals with incomes of less than of whom only per cent are covered which is just half the percentage of coverage among the aged in general of the welfare state mr harrington says its creation had been stimulated by mass impoverishment and misery yet it helped the poor least of all laws like unemployment compensation the wagner act the various farm programs all these were designed for the middle third in the cities for the organized workers and for the big market farmers it benefits those least who need help most the industrial workers led by john l lewis mobilized enough political force to put through section a of the national industrial recovery act which with the wagner act made the cio possible the big farmers put enough pressure on henry wallace roosevelts first secretary of agriculturewho talked a good fight for liberal principles but was a hamlet when it came to actionto establish the two basic propositions of welfare state agriculture subsidies that now cost billion a year and that chiefly benefit the big farmers and the exclusion of sharecroppers tenant farmers and migratory workers from the protection of minimumwage and social security laws no doubt the kennedy administration would like to do more for the poor than it has but it is hampered by the cabal of republicans and southern democrats in congress the revision of the fair labor standards act which raised the national minimum wage to the not exorbitant figure of an hour was a slight improvment over the previous act for instance it increased coverage of retailtrade workers from per cent to per cent but onefourth of the retail workers still excluded earn less than an hour there was also a considerable amount of shadowboxing involved of the workers newly covered only were making less than an hour and there was the exclusion of a particularly illpaid group of workers nobody had anything against the laundry workers personally it was just that they were weak unorganized and politically expendable to appease the conservatives in congress whose votes were needed to get the revision through they were therefore expended the result is that of the workers in the laundry drycleaning and dyeing industries just are now protected by the fair labor standards act perpetuating poverty it seems likely that mass poverty will continue in this country for a long time the more it is reduced the harder it is to keep on reducing it the poor having dwindled from twothirds of the population in to onequarter today no longer are a significant political force as is shown by the senates rejection of medicare and by the democrats dropping it as an issue in the elections last year also as poverty decreases those left behind tend more and more to be the ones who have for so long accepted poverty as their destiny that they need outside help to climb out of it this new minority mass poverty so much more isolated and hopeless than the old majority poverty shows signs of becoming chronic the permanence of low incomes is inferred from a variety of findings write the authors of the morgan survey in many poor families the head has never earned enough to cover the familys present needs for most families however the problem of chronic poverty is serious one such family is headed by a thirtytwoyearold man who is employed as a dishwasher though he works steadily and more than full time he earned over in his wife earned more but their combined incomes are not enough to support themselves and their three children although the head of the family is only thirtytwo he feels that he has no chance of advancement partly because he finished only seven grades of school the possibility of such families leaving the ranks of the poor is not high children born into poor families today have less chance of improving themselves than the children of the pre poor rags to riches is now more likely to be rags to rags indeed the morgan book concludes it appears that a number of the heads of poor families have moved into less skilled jobs than their fathers had over a third of the children of the poor according to the survey dont go beyond the eighth grade and will probably perpetuate the poverty of their parents there are a great many of these children in an important study of poverty made for a congressional committee in dr robert j lampman estimated that eleven million of the poor were under eighteen a considerable number of younger persons are starting life in a condition of inherited poverty he observed to which mr harrington adds the character of poverty has changed and it is no longer associated with immigrant groups with high aspirations it is now identified with those whose social existence makes it more and more difficult to break out into the larger society even when children from poor families show intellectual promise there is nothing in the values of their friends or families to encourage them to make use of it of the top per cent of highschool studentsthose scoring and over in iq testsonly half go on to college the explanation for this amazingand alarming situation is as much cultural as economic the children of the poor now tend to lack what the sociologists call motivation at least one foundation is working on the problem of why so many bright children from poor families dont ever try to go beyond high school mr raymond m hilliard at present director of the cook county ie chicago department of public aid and formerly commissioner of welfare for new york city recently directed a representativesample investigation which showed that more than half of the n ablebodied cook county residents who were on relief were functionally illiterate one reason cook county has to spend a month on relief is the lack of basic educational skills of relief recipients which are essen i tial to compete in our modern society an interesting footnote apropos of recent happenings at ole miss is that the illiteracy rate of the relief recipients who were educated in chicago is per cent while among those who were educated in mississippi and later moved to chicago it is percent 11831 100 s а v q e ףv 9 l c
