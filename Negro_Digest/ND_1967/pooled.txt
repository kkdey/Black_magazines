whats needed now for the arts is to get them away from white people as example of their culture of life finally and all its uses and back where such strivings belong as strong thrusts of a healthy people what we want now is plays of filling in and extendreality commenttheir art all instance ing so called ing altering rebutting it but the same cause life plays of specific finding of human occasion that is where is the confrontation between life and death the wrench of soul and white crap ugliest bring in the image of man and plays triumphant again evolution animals need humanism the humans we will show embracing spiritism we will have plays for city hall at the time of city hall so black humanity will know how we lived how we triumphed plays enabling black people to stop bogus socalled urban renewal which be nigger removal and the repeated disarming of carthage but at the time of and at the place of in the street at the spot where such disarming is taking place have your actors shoot mayors if necessary right in the actual mayors chambers let him feel the malice of the let the people see justice out repeatedly explain evolution plays for the police departmentjew plays whether con rolling big ass communications or laying in southorangeavenue always dough producing swamps light in every element show the chains let them see the chains as object and subject and let them see the chains fall away we will place and strike according to the stone or reality and project our truth our findings as an action as a projection into place feeling invisibility of the actual this is to say that we are ghosts too but everything is a ghost whore plays black politician plays plays of the instant of silence in the shoeshine parlor a whole looking for a whole an ascendancy an appearance to break heads and tear down buildings we want a postamerican form an afterwhiteness color to live and reerect the strength of the primitive plays where history is absolutely meaningful and contemporary the first learnings of man while we fly into the next epoch recently in new york a friend of mine handed me an adveri tisement for a poetry reading a card which declared in bold letters black magic black art will topple the citadel of white racist america he smirked as i looked at the card and told me that art wasnt gonna do sh my friend is one of those who believe we black artists should beat our saxophones and typewriters into spears and daggers and each pick out a white pelt and be recorded in history as the black assassin saints which isnt what stokely means by black_power but getting back to the card my buddy had picked the wrong time to try to rile me into an argument on the relevance of art one the new york critical establishment had just hung my play out for targetpractice two in this same day i had seen two brilliant black poetplaywrights of two widely separated generations both of whom were struggling through new york like crippled lizards so rather than going a few verbal rounds with him i told my friend something vulgar and sat down he respected my mood and just shutup and let charlie parker talk well we sat there with bird playing and me wishing for my wifeshe was here on campus or maybe a whole harem or some religion i could believe in or something and i kept looking at this card black art will destroy white racist america i thought about the work of the two writers i had seen earlier of men like richard wright james baldwin and ralph ellison and there was charlie parker on the boxa black man with his art was all that flowing convoluted beauty charlie was pushing considered black magic too would it topple white racist america i remembered a white guy dave lets say in detroit telling me that when he started listening to parker clifford brown and others he knew he couldnt keep on being scared of black cats and in his words protecting myself with the stereotypes so he started making the jazzsets and introduced himself to some black people i think he even eventually went south with one of the rights groups so when charlie led dave to shake hands with blackfolks something had toppled right some preconceptions and stereotypes certainly dave had at least stepped toward that frenetic frightening darkness from which all that music was being shaped good but supposeand it occurred to me because he had all the makingsdave turned out to be one of those quixotelone rangercomplexed ones who couldnt stand reprimands and commands from the supposed sanchoes and tontoes who were now asserting themselves and their own directions and so found it easier to protest for the vietnamese who would not try to regulate methods of positions in the protest one of those totally committed as long as the means and ends fit the terms of their own vision of things but completely unable to understand it when a malcolm_x or stokely c tells them that their physical psychological image goes counter to the needed impact on ripped and selfdoubting black minds that at best he can be a silent partner plotting with black men around conference tables but having his truerealwork to do alone in places like cicero illinois and hillbilly country southern america where at least he can order a cup of coffee and begin to talk to people before trouble starts can even move in and start a club or something suppose dave was one of those who would rather try to protest across oceans than have black men point directions for him still good charlie still had helped topple something within davebroken the godisalwayson ourside idea inspired the step that led to protest yeh still a score for black art black magic if you will i intended to run that point down to my friend but i stopped myself as i anticipated a possible and very disturbing reaction of his there is a bitter line in my play fightin or fussin beggin or cussin you always gotta go through chuck and here immediately i had jumped to that side of the fence to prove a point to establish validity unconsciously automatically damn its enough to make you go vomiting through the house breaking all the mirrors now it is white racist america which must be toppled destroyed the one which exploits race and class denies the truth of mans human sameness to all men not that ideal racialrainbow that now and again incredibly peeps through and has set forth ideas and methods to better mans people to people relationships but that greenbacked red white and bluebellied snake thats the one that has to go now it sits heaviest on the heads of black men and to speak of the black artists power to topple it is to get into the whole idea of black mens selfassertion of black men going and doing for themselves if i were going to say something i had to talk first of what black mens art did to and for black men what it made them feel and want to assert i had to get to why the two of us were sitting there listening to bird as though the room were suddenly a mosque and this music was the chant of the true believers i dont know about my friend ray but when i first heard charlie it was like well let me put it just like it was like all boys i depended on the things i saw and heard around me for selfclarification for reaffirmations of my urges and longings intuitions and impulses to give me some idea of my way of being so i went along fingerpopping shaking my hips doing the chicken getting some little mamas skirt dirty as we rubbed bellies against the wall to one of those syrupy beats you know and in that detroit hasting street environment everything was about like that kind of music in that register with that kind of focuspoint bluesy and groovy you know i dug it it was cool but always i had this frustrated intuitive vibration this sense of never really hearing or seeing anything truly indicative of all that was me or nearly all that footpatting shoulderdipping pelvicevoluting groove was all right but needed some more image some further higher points of selfreflection then i stumbled onto what charlie parker bud powell and others were doing and lo affirmations affirmations affirmations those quick changing rhythms that involved lyricism the shifting harmonies the speakins not only in two or three shouted words but in long flowing complex sentences how can i tell you about the sudden possibilities this music brought to me the ceiling lifted and out went my sense of freakishness here was what i could not get from white movies no matter how good they were here was that intangible difference in the way ernie wagner moved up the basketball court for northeastern high and the way karl kawalski came down for denby high in what seemed so strange and exotic to othersand so real and natural to mein this music was something of the reason why i could hardly get a new hat out of the store before i had to break it down and put that particular pointedjitterbug if you mustcrease in it you see that hat had to start right away looking like where it had to live and whom it had to suit not some designer in some factory yes affirmations and possibilities charlie told me by the particular points and creases that he put to old standards like in the sill of the night that i could wear my felt crown to the white house and not have to stumble all over myself trying to act and sound like i was a fourthgeneration graduate from harvard he crystallized a nuance of being that was very necessary to me i needed that crease in my hat he along with others updated the sound of things added intellect to sensuality sped up the beat so that the footpatting was still there but now it was like the way you stomp out a cigarette when youve got to clear your mouth because youve got something to say and life is racing and most importantly i say once more that this music was one of the things that convinced me that i could be as black as night and hastings street and still be whatever in life i wanted if only i did it well enough they might not play my music on the radio and try to make a joke out of me but someone somewhere would react if i did it well affirmations and inspiration that is what the black artist must mean to the black man speaking of the qualities of himself and his livingplace as truthfully and artistically as he can with no ones standards or acceptance in mind but his own the artist strikes empathy and identification there is the reaction of acknowledgement than the assertion of what has been acknowledged and the changing and topplingfirst inner with the body personal then outward through the bodies social political etcis on its way and if you think that all this sounds very romantic you are right in any revolution or evolutionif youd ratherthere must be the romantic art the wishes and longings must be symbolized and projected the pains and transgressions must be fixed in hated pictures jazzso far the blackest of the artsis probably the most romantic music since brother beethoven gave up the ghost and that is as it should be there is a peculiarly ironic reason for jazz americas most indigenous and significant contribution to art being basically and mainly the work of black men and for jazzmen being far ahead of all other black artists in true selfexpression and assertion that reason is that only in music were our slave forefathers allowed to retain and nurture anything of africa of blackness you see me being white and the slavemaster and all aint about to let you talk in no old tribal language naw no tellin what you might be gettin those black heads together on when l cant understand you so no storytelling no passing down traditions and all that youll learn this here language and the right stories outta this goodbook and the lies i got to tell you and enforce upon you sos i can sleep at night thats all and none of that foolin roun with your hands either you might call it sculpturing and painting but it looks like voodoo signs to me you gonna paint paint christ like michelangelo and them did you gonna make figures out of wood and stone then put some clothes on em and make em look more like me than they do sos can trust em but boy that rhythm you all got with them drums a nd oh those deep soulful voices want to go sing outside the bighouse and out in the fields while youre workingkeeps your mind occupied and it makes everything sound and look and feel so peaceful yes that is why the jazzman is the furthest along in selfassertion and unrestrained unaccommodating selfexpression because the slavemaster understood the danger in education but had never gotten to socrates warning about the songmakers so since music is the most abstract least concrete or plastic of the arts the jazzmaker never had to waste precious time proving how well he knew the language and forms of western man but went right ahead and bent that european scale to fit his own impulses had jazzmen been using words or readily definable images like our writers and painters then they too would be just now emerging in their true colors would have been squelched by editors publishers and critics for john coltrane is a man who through his saxophone before your eyes and ears completely annihilates every single western influence and longs and strains so totally so desperately for the asianafrican nuance that soon he is actually there in his playingas a man who calls on his gods and lo they appear this is the same thing as the afrohaircuts and clothes worn by people who have never been further east than bostona rejection and a yearning it may seem all a ridiculous joke to you but it is no less an effective and important joke than the one which was once recorded as law in this country that two indians and one africanor viceversa im not sureconstituted legally one human being yeh funny huh now getting back to the music there is another saxophonist named pharoah saunders who plays horrible lynchscenes with barking dogs and all coming out of his horn and thento my strange mind at leastgoes into the massacre of the resultant retaliation with the bleeding screams of men women and children when he finishes you dont know whether to applaud or go ask for an aspirin and a boatticket to somewhere else but it is truth as he has witnessed and visualizes it it is an artful projection there are other men like sonny rollins and ornette coleman who play so starkly freely personal that one knows that somehow they have felt nearly all the stimuli and hangups of this place and this time have gone into themselves somewhere and found new scales new harmoniesa new religion in fact now isnt that frighteningly interesting and what would it sound like in words appear as in definite symbols and images would it affect the selectiveservice draft do you think make for further boycotts and rejections with verbal jazzmen like leroi jones adding and explaining dimensions what will this yearning for the destruction of things western and the exulting of things eastern and this other personal insulation come to mean when it has all hit earth and settled i honestly do not know i only know that at least psychically there will be changes good changes it is as i eventually answered my friend black art can do a lot to topple white racist america if it is black enough what do i mean by black enough well let me try to give some examples of what i mean by black art or more specifically black literature i mean when a black writer really works inside that yearold sister sadie who has been a rock of her church for some thirty years and finds that she is a black nun loving and giving herself to herherjesus with a passion and a need that catholics only dream guiltily about that there are such things in that africanbaptist dance she does when the spirit hits her that are hardly imaginable to most people i mean when a writer looks into one of those housing projects and sees anna karenina or a madame bovarywith a different hue tone and manner of courseand just when the worldreader is panting for her and hoping that her plans work out the writer drops in the bigoted white cop of this black ghetto setting like a filthy stinkbomb and splatters the lovestory all to hell with a quick triggerfinger thats more like what blackness in this country is like life being stopped because its covering its skin is taboo i mean putting john henry on stage with his pride and hammers and wife family neighbors and have him go roaring against automation and the enslavement of the human spirit cussing fighting loving and hating all the way coming down hard on anybody and anything standing against his simple truth aw a man aint nothin but a man i mean a writer examining that crude but almost reflexive phrase the big mf and seeing in it matriarch feeding oedipus complex coming out of the emasculation of the black male and father image and the historic rape of the black woman and finding the way to explode that phrase into full meaning and consciousness i mean a writer sitting the late and great malcolm_x down with us and letting us hear the tobes and nottobes of a more modern and unique hamlet i mean seeing on paper how a black ghetto organizes politically and otherwise against the pressures of government police landlords and mafia the fictionist is free to project neverbeforeseen times places and circumstances hes the one whos supposed to be sitting up all night taking on and raking over the sins of this world is he not i mean a way of literarily stylizing that little bouncedip in the walks those creases and points in those hats i mean a literature knowing that since it deals with human beings the universals will fall no matter what if the readers lap is open so concerning itself with colloquials the little shades and nuances that come out of unique lifeexperiences and environmental influences a literature that asserts rather than reacts states rather than explains that is what i mean by black literature and when this literatureas did irish russian french and earlier american literaturefinally comes into being adding its weight to all the other force factors in the air there will be a change in the consciousness the selfsense of this country this people and something must topple must give way to the changes estifying and what j t a g shapes people your ii r mind our theatre will ita rm be a definitive act a ztiiris decisive song there will be portions of actual life unveiled all the things we could have been all the things we are all the things we will be there will be instruction there will be construction there will also be destruction really grinding all the faggoty frankensteins crapping their balls and eating them piecemeal before our very eyes forming our negative references detestable and detested check out leroi jones black mass his most accomplished play to date in my opinion jacoub a black magician in the pursuit of creation for creations sake a perversion like art for arts sake creates this monster the monster runs around like crazy vomiting and eating the vomit no one can communicate with it long before its only understandable sound me white reaches us we have identified this beast it has no regard for human life everything it touches undergoes a horrible distortion it touches tila a beautiful black woman who suddenly turns into a halfwhite monster hopping and slobbering around like this inhuman monster may you die a most horrible death if you claim you do not recognize this monster and its victims theatre as poetry be it comic or tragic be it instruction or entertainment remains an act which through language as complementary vehicleimage rhythm symbolcarves from life reveals and celebrates future direction it weaves past and present together to clarify future points of reference which exist now as desire or the artists imagination the language is necessarily complementary to the action to clarify some aspects of the experience psychic or physical so there will be very little dialogue because speech or words will come in only when other sounds or the action cannot clearly supply the necessary image the images and symbols will be national put up for clarification and illustration by the sharpedged sensibility of the artist whose impulse throbs with the nations desire and pulse the desired and desirable will be seen through elegant image and symbol abstracted from life the undesirable the corrupting the destructive will be portrayed in a grotesque manner its sinister qualities driving us to the mercy killing of the villain dont get me wrong this will not be life in its entirety it will be portions of life because art is not life art is contained in life life is the bigger body from which art cuts out bleeding portions for illustration revelation celebration and whatever moves the capable sensibility leaping from the corner where a spade is a spade yes we will finally be coming to grips with where we are really at historically we will be destroying the symbols which have facilitated our captivity we will be creating and establishing symbols to facilitate our necessary constant beginning old decadent wouldbe black woman this theatre will straighten out your mind instead of your hair if you are too twisted andor petrified to be straightened out it will pulp you to death your hideous little imitation life pungent like the stench of stale menstrual flow it will be a cleaning up for a theatre life portions of sheer beauty paths towards a life of construction after the necessary destruction how do you relate to that stupid powdery mask you wear every morning or all that junk in your toilet i understand now they even wear blonde wigs in south africa are you some imitation caucasian bitch have mercy on the male counterpart selling black for a quick screw as welton smith so clearly points out the villains in the theatre as in real life will be alienated and destroyed fearridden noball cowards drowned in their own filth forced to yield place to a better order of things we want to love and laugh unrestrained for this nowlost simple natural right our new heroes will giantwalk and destroy any and everything that attempts to militate against that desire as indeed we have to do in real life all the antilife crap that must vacate our minds will go up in flames jehovah jc capitalism hollywood art for arts sake the whole jive all points of reference will emerge from within the nation so will our heroes literary and nationaldedan kimathi malcolm du bois nkrumah nyerere babu toure fanon and many more living and being born every day pulsating with visions of a world worth killing and dying for the european game will be over in the arts as in our real life for a long time this theatre will not be liked because it will make many people uncomfortable because it will be a portrayal of truth because we have been trained in western freak institutions to be afraid of truth is it then surprising that confrontation with truth unveiled is not always particularly pleasant again like jones sings these are natural things no one is threatening anybody thats just the way life is my play wedding band is the story of a black woman and a white man south carolinians who in the year desire to become legally married it was then and m tnc is now against the state law for two such citizens to be joined in matrimony the drama also concerns two black warriors serving in world war i known as the war to end all wars with the assurance that after the battle patriotism would be rewarded with firstclass citizenship it is now three wars later and the promise made is still unkept other characters include three black women struggling in various ways to survive without the protection of their men two white women in conflict with each other and the contradictions of society a poor white salesman comically lost in the confused labyrinth of his own mind and a negro servant who earns a lonely but wellfed existence by deliberately turning away from the problems of progress against this tragicomic background two little girls one white the other colored are deeply impressed by the unfolding of events people tend to ask why write about thatthat usually stands for the possibility of controversy which has a way of stemming from themes on race or interracial conflict when presented in a land which abounds in racist law and racism but no matter how much has been seen and heard about that little of it has come from the american writer of african descent only of his plays have reached broadway in the last years only two were made into filmsa raisin in the sun by lorraine hansberry and purlie victorious by ossie davis it seems evident that theatre audiences have not been exposed to a great deal of controversial or any other kinddrama created by the afroamerican playwright sixteen plays over such a period of time constitute a very small percentage of the thousands presented on the big street in the art center of the u s a new york city n y much more work has seen the light of day on the stages of offbroadway and in community theatres improvised in churches libraries and meeting halls these productions have reached only a small section of the public and as a result we hear little if anything about themexcept from those scholars who devote time and energy to researching the subject playwright and guggenheim fellow loften mitchells new book black drama which comes from the press this spring promises to shed more light on a comparatively unexplored subject our dramatists have not had a wider viewing because we as a people have not had the power to decisively determine the quality and quantity of our participation in theater television radio and films which power would enable us to portray life as we see it also those who have the power and the means of production seem at best constrained to move slowly and to keep pace with the advances or setbacks of the national struggle for human and civil_rights the characters in a play may be made of impressions gathered from old or new incidents conversations disconnected words and sensememories of physical characteristics and human emotions they are created and constructed of what hurts and what heals slowly built and put in order out of the conflict which comes from the daily search for bread love and a place in the sun the best characters are good and true cowardly and brave miserable and happy filled with the virtues and weaknesses found in ourselves they grow stronger and more insistent in the mind of the writer they cancel each other out until the right story and the right people emerge and blend into one predominant idea or theme the story of wedding band gradually took shape as the result of a reaction to hearing that old chestnut quoted time and time t againthe two freeest things in the country are the black woman and the white man the more it was repeated the more often i wondered what kind of freedom the originator of the remark had m in mind it is a known fact that in cer tain states in the union the black woman in and out of bondage was free with or without her consent and to the detriment of her children to have her body exploited as unpaid and cheap labor andor illegal sex in these same states the white man was free to use her wrongly for these purposes but not free to offer her or their offspring the protection of his name and property segregationists constantly proclaim that we cannot legislate in order to force citizens toward equal rights and better race relations but they have passed thousands of laws to force us in the opposite direction it seems that such reasoning should have resulted in no race creed or color laws at all which would leave people free to think for themselves after writing a first draft of the play i spent considerable time in libraries researching the racist laws found in the united states it would have been easy to spend a few years or even a lifetime at this endeavor so i had to call a halt and go back to the job of writing anyone interested in the subject will save time by reading the very excellent book titled states laws on race and color compiled and edited by attorney pauli murray published by the womens division of christian service of the methodist church it is interesting to know that after emancipation the state of georgia declared every colored child born before march shall be the legitimate child of his mother this action clearly prevented the black mother from claiming any inheritance for her children born of a slavemaster father the harm done by such a law was compounded by the attitude of selfdepreciation and selfhatred it sometimes engendered in the black communities most racemixing had taken place under the sanction of the slave institution but in the interest of selfpreservation the penniless black now technically out of bondage was forced to keep quiet concerning his relationship to white families his race was now lightened to various shadings and newly labeled colored on documents rest room doors drinking water fountains and railroad station waiting rooms even the statistics of today very much concerned with counting how many heads are on welfare credit the entire mixed population to the black people we see no calculation as to the number of such persons who represent the disinherited those bilked of any portion of what was rightfully theirs due to the legal exploitation of black women the few whites who wished to acknowledge their mixed families were by law forbidden to do so some passed for colored and were married in the south but upon the death of such a person his relatives were able to disprove the marriage and seize all the worldly goods of any material value even today in this matter we frequently allow ourselves to be placed on the defensive why talk about thatl if we criticized the law theyll think we want to be with them if we criticized segregation at all theyll think were avidly seeking their company it is certainly evident that the black american has had nothing to do with the creation or implementation of such devious legal trickery as racist law but put on the defensive it somehow seems to many of us that a challenge to what has been set up to regiment and regulate our lives places us in danger of being judged by the oppressor and ourselves and found wanting in dignity and integrity under the sanctimonious cover of states rights some citizens have been able to plan the future of others without their participation separate but equal law has had more than a hundred years to further impoverish the black communities wedding band examines womans position in society her situation at this very moment the story is set in and reveals through the people of that time how few of the wrongs which threaten family unity have been righted in order to deal with the subject a writer must find his way through a maze of confusion and clear away the warped thinking caused by slavery and its after effects the acid poisons of selfhatred and contempt caused by the miseducation of the people in order to deal effectively with the problems created by marriage laws it was necessary to make sure that the play not be interpreted as one which advocates the intermarriage of races that kind of treatment would place the work almost in the same camp as the antipeople legislation therefore no character could plead the cause of intermarriage and none suggest the changing of law the other hurdle to overcome was the shadow cast by all the stories that have been told about the mintjulep colonel and his almostwhite sweetheart for my leads i selected a black seamstress and a white baker and projected them into a situation in which there was no premeditated intention of exploitation on either side and only the events that take place in their lives during the crisis of an influenza epidemic were used in shaping the progress of the play also because some of us hope to be assimilated absorbed and digested into the mainstream of american life thus proving that we in and of ourselves are not american life it was necessary for my story to have a black woman who did not seek this kind of solution in her personal act of integration where did such a woman meet a white man on at least an almost equal footing the obvious place to find an unprotected young woman living away from family and friends is in domestic service on the kind of sleepin job which allows a monthly or bimonthly visit home the closest white equal in this case might be an unmarried tradesman operating a oneman business in this way the seamstress and baker were set up to meet and unfold the story the most crucial three days in the relationship take place years after their first meeting and so the entire action is accomplished during this threeday period the missing factor in the interracial tales usually found in fiction is the black man the colonels sweetheart never seemed to know any men of her own race and those presented as background filler were usually slackkneed objects of pity this caused me to see an admirable black man in the center of the drama one who could supply a counterpoint story with its own importance a man whose every day existence is threatened with the possibility of a life and death struggle after the first or second draft of the script there comes a time when all the earmarks of preachment must be searched out and removed all that has been superimposed by the writer all that the characters deny and refuse to accept anything that smacks of pamphleteering on the subject out come some of your favorite bits and piecesthe idiom of speech never used by those characters who people your work you are taxed to show them as they are beautiful in a way not yet merchandised by madison avenue one day the federal government must declare that no state may carry any law which infringes upon the federal rights of any citizen such action will lift the struggle for human and civil_rights to the position where the people may move forward with the unstinting approval of their government between that time and this we who find ourselves born into this past and present situation will continue to protest in various ways according to our understanding and circumstances those conscious of living in the blight of legalized limitation will continue to be engrossed in the controversy of to be or not to be free the american of african descent has produced the only new music which came out of the new worldspirituals gospel and jazz i firmly believe that for him the protest play will reach new heights in form and content become ever more finished in craftsmanship and eventually prove to be the most varied and original theatre on the american scene the times dictate the trend we are at a moment in history when the playwright cannot turn away from social drama without abandoning the search for truth in a conference monday may th in ann arbor david rambeau director of the concepteast theatre was told by university officials that the lilywhite association of producing artists was an artistic ideal mr rambeau met with university vicepresident heyns assistant to the vicepresident miller professor schnitzer executive director of the apa and professor sattler chairman of the speech department when these officials were questioned about other areas of the professional theater program over the past two years these details were revealed in the new play project and the professional fellowship program scholarships per year no negroes were utilized in the play of the month series one negro actress in two years when it was pointed out to vicepresident heyns that one negro in two years in all four areas the apa play of the month series new play project and the professional fellowship program indicated reasonable evidence of the absence of equal opportunity mr heyns instructed mr rambeau that the situation could remain so for ten years and still be no indication of discrimination or unequal opportunity during the discussion mr rambeau attempted to introduce the comments of frederick oneal negro actors leader looks at the record detroit news recently elected president of actors equity who cited the patterns of discrimination in the theater however none of the university officials would even so much as peruse the editorial to ascertain whether the comments might possibly be applied to the situation at the university of michigan professor schnitzer flatly stated there is no prejudice in the theater when questioned as to whether any negroes had ever been with the apa the university officials stated that that information was not available when queried as to what evidence would indicate discrimination mr rambeau was summarily told by professor schnitzer that he and mr rabb casting director were not prejudiced if there were no negroes in the apa it was merely because none had applied for auditions or that if any had applied none was qualified vicepresident heyns accepted this statement as gospel and indicated that though the university had hired the apa it could not question the segregated casting policy as this would be an infringement on artistic freedom when mr rambeau pointed out to vicepresident heyns that the play of the month series was bringing to the campus segregated shows from broadway and that the university should not buy such productions he was told to go talk to the producers of the shows or produce concrete evidence and not statistics rambeau pointed out that this kind of evidence statistics was the only kind readily available to the outsider and that this is what civil_rights organizations and the president s committee on equal opportunity used in their investigations mr rambeau was asked what made him think these methods possessed any adequacy in this situation when mr rambeau suggested that one way to correct the situation would be to add some qualified negroes to the apa he was called a racist as the meeting wore on it became quite obvious that the university officials would do nothing on their own to correct the situation as they view the entire professional theater program as quite satisfactory still mr rambeau pressed question after question and point after point for nearly two hours in hopes of enlightening the university officials to the discriminatory setup existing in their theater he cited the concepts of cultural exclusion in the professional theater racial casting historical and current discrimination in movies television and the stage de facto segregation in the high school systems that feed the university drama program the selffulfilling prophecy in imprinting on potential negro applicants that they have no opportunity or place in white plays and the social and psychological community repercussions of segregated educational programsall to no avail when continued inquiry about university image educational idealism leadership and community obligation proved redundant mr rambeau concluded that further investigation by other concerned parties would have to be secured on this dissonant note the conference was terminated there exists an ironic postscript worthy of mention at neighboring michigan state university on may and was held a symposium on school integration which had two purposes first to focus attention on school segregation issues particularly in the north and west and second to contribute to the solutions of the problems through conversations between social scientists professional educators and local educational policy makers in obvious consequence of the may conference on discrimination in the professional theater program at the university of michigan the association of producing artists held a spade day audition in nyc concepteast officials were informed by their new york associates that the apa sent out a casting call to actors agents to which nearly negro actors and actresses responded to fill a single vacancy as the waiting rooms filled the applicants recognized the blatantly segregated scene and showered apa representatives with derision subsequent to the audition form letters were sent to the unqualified applicants informing them that they had failed to meet apa standards in a stealthy plot to avoid rigorous negotiation of differences the apa failed to inform the concepteast of their decision to open the theater company to token integration officials of concepteast viewed this as another subtle attempt of the power structure to foist a unilateral decision on the negro as to his needs and the limit of his opportunity this endplay by the apa in their new york audition is just another insult to the two years of injury which the negro endured from the universitys lilywhite professional theater program which was termed by its executive director as an artistic ideal in view of this naive maneuver the concepteast set its minimum terms for bringing a reasonable degree of equal opportunity into the university program as follows employment of six qualified negro actors for the coming season a public statement of nonracial casting awarding of two of the seven fellowships in the professional fellowship program to negro colleges that all broadway or offbroadway shows brought to the university in the play of the month series be integrated that this years new play in the new play project be authored by a negro concepteast termed its request reasonable in view of the two years of public and private bigotry during the residence at the university of the apa if these minimum requests are met the apa can maintain its private prejudices behind a mask of liberal equal opportunity as behavior rather than attitude is crucial to the concepteast in the face of obtrusive hypocrisy as evidenced by the situation in the universitys professional theater program one can easily understand the invectiveridden nature of plays authored by negroes who evaluate their american dream james baldwins blues for mr charlie and leroi jones dutchman belch the grim need for recognition in the us the concepteast has had its broiled eyes focused on the apa for two solid years watching the scene develop while silently singing the blues now its time for blues for mr charlie on august david rambeau director of the concepteast theatre filed a complaint with the michigan civil_rights commission charging the university of michigan and the association of producing artists with complicity in discriminatory practices in employment and education in the operation of their professional theater program on september milton brown field representative of the mcrc met with university attorneys university vicepresident heyns assistant to the vice president miller and executive director of the apa schnitzer in this preliminary investigation data was sought on the alleged discriminatory practices prior to the initiation of a formal suit because of the interstate nature of the case concepteast theatre officials have asked the actors equity association and the new york state commission for human rights to investigate the new york operations of the association of producing artists and submit advisory opinions when questioned about the apa mr rambeau stated this acting company might as well have come from mississippi for all the equ opportunity it is supposed to have its hiring practices are not unlike those of the apprentice trades and everybody knows that situation besides michigan has enough problems without importing some of new yorks if the apa is characteristic of the hiring policies in new york theres little wonder that there are riots in harlem and brooklyn during a continued discussion of the complaint mr rambeaus views were enlarged and detailed the apa and the university of michigan constitute just one phase of a total system of economic and educational discrimination existing in the united states against the negro if there is any initial problem in prosecuting the complaint it will be in identifying their the university and apa specific roles and discriminatory actions in the broad pattern of racial prejudice this pattern of economic discrimination is recurrent in every area of the dramatic arts films television radio and the legitimate stage as educational discrimination is evidenced by de facto segregation in the schools elementary and high schools overcrowded classes slanted texts and biased school administrators the end results are theatre companies like the apa and freshman classes at the university of michigan wherein negroes were found enrolled in the class of over then we witness frantic corrective measures apas spade day audition in new york this summer and token hiring of a negro to sit by the door so that if and when investigators come they can trot out their kept nigger and say look look oh no were liberal and legal for government contracts weve got one of them and corrective measures like the universitys scholarships for the culturally deprived approximately scholarships so that now the freshman class will have slightly less than three per cent negro enrollment rather than slightly less than one per cent this paltry progress is designed to be balm for the white educated liberals conscience his egoistic realization of noblesse oblige and christian charity this paltry progress is designed to placate black moderates and castrate black militants all such stopgap measures are ultimately unsatisfactory because the bigoted immoral premises on which they are based are ultimately untenable for both the victim and the oppressor we now witness the internationally esteemed university of michigan its attorneys and vice presidents defending a corrupt situation the professional theatre program in a corrupt system economic and educational strangulation based on corrupt values racial discrimination perhaps the time has p y come to assess those characteristics which skcwssi make the new york shakespeare festival an important american classical theatre even though the festival has achieved recognition primarily on artistic grounds there are nevertheless certain problems inherent in the interracial structure of the company which take on importance beyond the basic consideration of professional abilities our attention in this article will be directed towards these social problems which have developed from the racial composition of the festival organization because of its role as the popular theatre for everyone the festival has a critical responsibility to the multiracial community which supports its program this obligation has been fulfilled only within recent years through a balanced company representing the various ethnic groups present in new york city joseph papp the festival producer seems to be making an honest effort in this direction he stated in an interview on april a major objective of the festival we would like to have a company that is representative of all the various facets of the population of new york city all the various minorities and we want this not for sociological reasons but for artistic reasons in comparison to other repertory companies such as the arena theatre in washington d c the lincoln center repertory company in new york city and the american conservatory theatre in san francisco the attempt is impressive a closer look at the problems created by the integrated aspects of the company is perhaps best observed through an analysis of coriolanus as directed by gladys vaughan in this particular play dramatizes the inner struggles of a roman aristocrat caius marcius coriolanus a man unable to overcome the inadequacies of his moral and ethnical principles through his actions we are able to see the larger conflicts existing between peasant and aristocrat in this legendary history of romes emergence as a world power this is one of shakespeares most difficult plays and is subject to a great number of interpretations mrs vaughan saw many parallels between this classic play and our society and felt that the mob would be more meaningful to this period if the cast were mixed the concluding lines in the program notes of the production elaborate upon this viewpoint since the future of the entire human race is now vulnerable to that moment of decision of the man in power a study of those who seek power is more pertinent than ever before the transposition of dramatic theme to a contemporary context introduced certain emotional tensions which reflected the present struggle of negroes for firstclass citizenship that which resulted on stage was more of a civil_rights demonstration than a play some anachronism is of course part of the contemporary form but even then it must be controlled in order not to distort the authors intentions the effects of such a narrow interpretation was obviously not foreseen there is a social comment implied in the theme of the play and the pattern of the action however it is not the responsibility of a director or actor to impose a preconceived idea upon a play or an audience a spectator can also limit and destroy an art experience by imposing predetermined expectations and terms of social reference upon a play and upon performers who exist momentarily within the world of the play one should be forced to think and draw his own conclusions through the artistic power of the drama rather than from predetermined valuejudgment we expect the playwright to provide us with experience which is more dynamic more objective and more coherent than the contradictions present in actual experience by the same token it is the responsibility of the artist to interpret this ordered experience by trying to find the authors intention and to transmit the same meaning to an audience without distortionthe dramatic focus and aesthetic quality of this particular production was vague and unclear in the first place the performance was too long additional editing of the script would have eliminated much that was unnecessary to the progression of the plot one critic remarked that the director had seen fit to put so many members of equity to work that the stage gets cluttered and the battle scenes look more like street rumbles than actual war it was obvious that the continual movement of citizens running on and off stage shouting waving flags and scrambling about resulted in action that was often unintentionally comical there were moments however when the crowd was a determined and suffering mob with the exception of jane white who played volumnia and james earl jones as the tribune junius brutus the remaining negro actors made up the majority of the tattered dirty mob john simon in his usual blunt manner observed with mrs vaughans roman citizenry about fourfifths negro rome became clearly the capital of abyssinia the few whites presumably accountable for as missionaries the trouble with this sort of thing is that it cannot help setting off wrong responses one such response occurred when the segregationist coriolanus mounted the platform and told the roman peasants i banish you the middleclass white audience in the delacorte theatre applauded it was obvious that they sided with the white element in what appeared to be a modern civilrights fight there was a great deal of action on the stage but it had little to do with an objective study of a democratic society in which neither side is totally right or completely wrong the director informed this writer that her choice of cast depended primarily upon the talents of the actors and the demands of the roles she further attempted to justify the use of so many negroes by stating this could have been historically accurate even in roman days so it wasnt historically inaccurate to cast negroes and we had several other ethnic groups represented this idea perhaps deserves praise from a social viewpoint but it did not serve the play as written what the audience observed was a group of actors in many situations which paralleled rather than expressed the play also the approach of a few actors in their roles merely emphasized the fact that they were negro their colloquial patterns of speech physical movements and facial gestures leads one to feel that they either lacked understanding of or disregard for the characters that were portrayed the arrangement of white to negro performers brought a different nuance to the script and quite possibly eliminated the play as it was originally conceived when various dramatic themes are interpreted to emphasize certain problems in american society especially with the addition of nonwhite cast membersthe plays take on an immediate importance dr esther jackson former director of education of the new york shakespeare festival may have discovered the solution to this serious problem which exists not only within the festival organization but within the american theatre at large i think the development of a multiracial ethic and a multiracial aesthetic on the stage are dependent upon helping artiststhat is the producers and directorsto free themselves subconsciously perhaps of very deep prejudices which make it necessary for them to use negro players in nonartistic ways no inference is being made that this is the basis of the problem as observed in coriolanus in this instance the director had some difficulty in maintaining the dominant idea among acting staging and designinghallmarks of a skilled director norman nadel felt that dramatic integration was lacking the integration so vital is the intimate relationship of one role to another and all to the play gladys vaughan accepted the risk of failure by approaching the text of legendary history from a contemporary viewpoint certainly the same risk is present in a conventional production if the results are dull and unimaginative whether she consciously considered coriolanus as a medium of social propaganda or only happened upon this idea is not the primary reason that her production was not completely successful there appeared to have been no coherent realization of theme reflected through the particular shape of the play and the artistic use of nonwhite actors within the play the emphasis of production focused on visual elements such as a wellmounted stage sumptuous costumes physically attractive actors exciting and realistic sound effects and movement patterns of choreographic dimension in the last analysis theatre is either good or bad it either succeeds in creating a meaningful experience or it fails in spite of the social ideas practiced by an individual or an organization since coriolanus is based on legendary history it is not totally symbolic the idea that integrated casting may possibly work better in plays that are nonovertly historical symbolic or poetic should be considered by mrs vaughan it could be that this play was a bad choice or perhaps less sophistication is necessary to recognize the universality of the human condition the problems that face the actors in the festival company are in many ways typical of those faced by the average american actor without a tradition of discipline and training in classical styles of acting the quality of production cannot help but be inferior in excellence one major cause is the absence of a pattern of continuity which a strong training program will provide not only for the actors but for the artistic and technical staff as well although casting procedures have been unbiased they nonetheless reflect gross indiscrimination a quantitative approach has resulted in a company which employs many unqualified actors from both races it is significant perhaps that the festival often prefers to use lightskinned negroes like frank silvera jane white or ellen holly in major roles there have been exceptions like robert hooks james earl jones and roscoe lee browne however the limitation of certain types of negroes to a variety of nonheroic lead roles has been naive in spite of the preceding criticism the festival has made a unique contribution to the american theatre its innovating spirit and earnestness in taking classical drama presenting it with some style and taste and yet making it practical enough to be enjoyed by a large crosssection of people from all levels of society is significant also the festival directors have shown a large degree of integrity in an effort to measure up to high artistic goals which they have set for themselves and for the people of new york city in the midst of bureaucratic disinterest these at tempts are praiseworthy even though theory and practice are not completely harmonious at this time during the last few years the festival has earnestly worked towards integrated theatre in keeping with the peculiar makeup of our society this type of theatre offers the healthiest and most rewarding type of art experience to the greatest number of people but if the vitality and creativity of the negro actor is going to be reduced through integrated theatre then an allnegro theatre would probably be better actually what is needed for the total acceptance of a multiracial aesthetic is the broad exposure of society to integrated art activities the negro artist in many instances has much to offer the american theatre and an interracial theatre is perhaps where his greater contribution will be made theater for social welfare has replaced theatres old image an image of pastime activity the federal government is subsidizing many of the countrys repertory theaters however no black theaters and the present funded repertory theaters are not involving talents from the black communities there should be an involvement of the black communities in this new awareness of the power of the theaters because the social condition of this country is directly related to conditions in the black communities to say that barefoot in the park and hello dolly represent theater is in a sense like saying black communities do not exist it is a paradox to expect that nonexistent community to come downtown to broadway or to the tyrone guthrie theatre in minneapolis and pay to support what has no relation at all to what the members of that community know as this society item witness the odd couple any wednesday l do i do mame art for profit or a play by jean kerr has never been a password from black talents they are not that far removed from the lifeline but it is not the black talents who are funded or even encouraged to be a part of the federally supported repertory theaters the repertory companies are encouraged by the boards of education and the poverty programs to perform in the school systems and b fore the culturally deprived yet the plays and the artist are far removed from the lifeline of the black communities in new york and california there are cultural programs operating under the antipoverty program these drama and dance companies could easily operate in conjunction with the board of education to bring socially meaningful art to schools in the immediate area it seems to me that a theater for the social welfare of a community should provide opportunities for talented blacks in the communities to develop as artists within a professional setting at the same time this could demonstrate the need for communitybased repertory both talent and theater would be making a collective contribution to the community this is not happening the artists who are supported create from a safe distance therefore their work is synthetic its description of this society its attempt to make order out of chaos has no lasting value how can an artist depict a black art say of watts mississippi or harlem when that artist is living comfortably in westport or hollywood item the federal government under title and title is supporting stuart vaughns new orleans repertory theatre no negroes are involvedneither in background or foreground it has been proven that a black audience does exist for a socially meaningful theater blacks came out to support baldwins blues for mister charlie and amen corner they supported hansberrys a raisin in the sun leroi jones black arts repertory and his oneact plays the toilet the slave and dutchman now they are flocking to douglas turner wards happy ending and day of absence these plays could easily belong to a black federally supported repertory theater in a black community for integration a black hamlet genets the blacks or dubermans in white america otherwise black talent will continue to wait for white approval on projects that are watered rewritten andor rejected labeled protest oppressed people and classes have historically channeled their images and passions to the stage beaumarchais marriage of figaro kindled social fires that helped flame the french revolution gorkys the lower depths in dramatized the oppression of russias peasants clifford odets during the thirties stung the social conscience with his prolabor play waiting for lefty item art must deal with the time my students here at mobilization for youth were so moved by waiting for lefty that they adapted it from the original cab strike to a rent strike on new yorks lower east side something meaningful for them there must be some reason for not showing the young and the deprived what the theater is capable of doing could it be fear there must be a change in the identity of those who bring art into the black communities if blacks are to have quality education and participation in the various art forms including theater even now the lincoln center repertory company is taking live theater into the new york school system and to the culturally deprived while it is effective in the schools which are basically middle class it is less effective in the schools say in harlem and bedford stuyvesant this is because whites believe that blacks are still trying to assimilate it is the exact reverse on the ascendant now is a tremendous pride in being black whites ignorance of this is causing ineffectual education and of course the promotion of subject matter that is boring to the children in these areas in the theater of the sixties black consciousness has reached new levels of concentration and intensity a metaphysical play by beckett with negro and puerto rican performers would be more effective than shakespeare with an allwhite cast this is due to an immediate identification with the visual image of the present item in harlem roger furman operating with oeo office of economic opportunity funds as a part of haryou has consistently exhibited fine theatre his productions with the young vital performer would be an inspiration for every junior high school student in the ghetto after reading the reports from ford foundation in the s and the rockefeller foundation one can hardly find reasons for them not dumping grants into these socially deprived communities the foundations state their policies which do not hold generally for black communities example the foundation should exercise discrimination and selectivity and give its funds largely for significant activity not likely to be supported by others they should seek out sustain and amplify excellence and where necessary create new centers of excellence they should help to increase the vigor of private institutions and private initiative in areas of critical concern to society there are some regional theaters in the united states supported by foundations and now the federal government under the national endowment of the arts and titles and under the elementary and secondary education act these theaters do not include blacks on staff as designers directors writers or technicians black actors are booked in as spear carriers in the old classics nothing is realistic in these regional theaters for the black artist nothing is realistic for black audiences now the federal government is helping to support this discriminating system it started in the middle fifties after the mccarthy senate investigations pop art emerged because the artist could say it meant a when it really meant b or vice versa art as well as the theater went abstract for safetyhappenings theatre of the absurd etc it became a lie artists knew this the public knew it it could not last black artists emerged from the chaos because they had less to lose white america went deeper into it by trying to escape via musicals comedies british angry young men and because the country was afraid it laughed and danced trying to forget the lie the social welfare of this country is at stake white america trying to escape from the inner city to the suburb is synonymous to whites trying to escape from what we all know can exist order in the chaos under all that singing and dancing on broadway there is a lifeline vietnam mississippi harlem watts malcolm_x theater is no longer a pastime it is serious business it can be dangerous and yet we know that black communities must have their own art centers because white values are not black values in the thirties when roosevelts workmans progress administration wpa supported the theater blacks were involved because the theater put money in circulation blacks didnt control it as many believe it was on the whole meaningful even though in the eyes of roosevelts administration it was pastime activity high class theater for social welfare was disguised as pastime activity until the establishment witnessed performances of the cradle will rock it cant happen here one third of the nation but now during the sixties theater for pastime activity cannot be disguised as theater for social welfare when we read that stuart vaughns new orleans repertory theater is doing charleys aunt we chuckle and say whitey is doing it again two things happen when a play about blacks is presented for whites anytime a play is presented on broadway or offbroadway it is presented for whites they stay away because they are not interested in the least in what blacks are saying because most of the time blacks are saying some truths about the conditions in this country or whites are so conditioned by musicals and comedies and historical museum pieces that they are not prepared to witness anything new for example consider the recent play whos got his own by ronald milner at the american place theatre harold clurman theater critic for the nation departed after act i and did not review the play now i must point out here that whos got his own is a black play american place theatre is a white theaterwith a good reputation its subscription audience is per cent white and through studies it has been proven that subscription audiences are middle class harold qurman is a critic for a national magazine he is as middle class as the audience for that play his dismissal of whos got his own reflects the feelings of that audience milner received a firstclass production of his play and a secondclass audience to approve its worth the wirter was caught in the paradoxical situation with which most black artists in this country are eventually faced to be an american artist and at the same time to be a negro to please the audience the author and the theater would have had to lie about the black mans condition in this country the artists function is to interpret life says john o killens i see him as a hunter in the jungle with civilization being the jungle his prey is truth socially meaningful theater must be truthful to the happenings of our time hat is the free southw ern theater followjj ing are some general and informal facts on its rounding and funding its projects and its prospects plus some comments on both the nature ofand the need for black community theater in february five members of the fst company appeared in a reading of afroamerican poetry at rochdale village queens new york after the show the company held a discussion with the audience as is its usual practice a woman questioner asked the company what sort of reaction do you get that is from southern audiences who have no orientation in theater your presentation seems very sophisticated the fst is in its third year began its fifth season on april with a converted flooded out supermarket as its theater in the desire project area of new orleans the fst hires a staff of approximately ten actors technicians and managers in january the fst advertised in the actors trade journals in new york for applicants who would like to be considered for the season almost white applicants mailed in resumes and photographs in laurel mississippi the company is performing gilbert moses original play roots about the illusions of an aging afroamerican mississippi couple the stage is on home plate at the laurel baseball stadium colored division there are no seats the audience stands from the pitchers mound backentering the theater from either third base first base or center field at one point in the script roscoe orman playing the old man is to attempt to open a jar but cant he struggles with the jar an old mississippi man wanders onto the stage from the crowd kindly assists roscoe returns to the audience the fst is appearing in sale hall morehouse college atlanta georgiahome of the cream of negro education the company presents its poetry show first half afroamerican second half afro it is a bitter and proud show designed to expose realities and foster reeducation afterwards during the discussion a young drama major says it has no plot you cant do drama that way drama must have plot and development the arrangement of the actors on stage was unbalanced there was more strength on the right than on the left this violates one of the first axioms of staging sam hill is reading his new play in the writers workshop in new orleans sam hill is a yearold high school junior who has written four plays and performed in two fst productions the company pays him a week the fst is his summer job the door is open sunlight and kids noise float in sams play is about a young husband who rebels against his staid young wife by debasing her with the wild lascivious animal sounds of a jazz record juno who is awaiting trial on some incredible charge or other wanders in juno listens to sams play when sam finishes juno says man you crazy wanders out a nigerian student who has studied at the university of illinois and has been with the fst three weeks is packing to return to illinois the company is very sad the nigerian said it is simply too hot it never gets this hot in nigeria we make a note to apply for an airconditioning grant from ritzy new york foundation in midday our building in new orleans is over degrees we own two small floor fans in the fst literature workshop there is one clear favorite the autobiography of malcolm_x the company receives a registered letter it is from a spokesman for the housing authority of new orleans the spokesman takes exception to the essay on the desire project in our poetry show which had been filmed in june for national presentation by cbstv our piece strikingly delivered by actress denise nicholas had told of lack of facilities for black people in the desire project it warned that if corrective action was not taken by the city or if black people in desire did not organize to force corrective action then new orleans could expect the same rioting which was exploding in other cities the tv show was filmed in our theater in desirea filmed discussion followed our audience the folk of the area heatedly discussed the whys and wherefores of their community the letter from the housing authority termed our presentation calculated to engender racial disharmony it went on to state if there were evidence of wilful neglect of chronic mistreatment of callousness in any other form on the part of the authority leading to the conclusion that the thousands of residents of the desire project are in effect abandoned in spite of all reasonable efforts to arouse the authority to a full sense of responsibility then and only then could we look without too much suspicion and distrust upon what we must consider an infamous indictment the letter suggested a meeting between the fst board of directors and the housing authority naming time and place we were to be requested to ask that the tv show be canceled the fst board which is very small and includes several company members declined to meet with the housing authority as far as we were concerned there was nothing to negotiate the housing authority of new orleans appealed to the national council of churches which sponsored the show without satisfaction the show appeared as scheduled august except in new orleans which blacked it out the company is returning from the last mississippi tour late in september fst owns three vehicles a weatherbeaten blue station wagon held together by rope on loan from sncc a weatherbeaten black station wagon given fst by photographer gordon parks and a truckvan which the company purchased about miles from new orleans the black beetle coughs sputters and dies the company leaves it to be repaired and pile into the blue beetle outside new orleans the blue beetle coughs sputters and dies push shove and strain into the truckvan it is august in bogalusa la it is dull in when the company appeared in bogalusa the black community was in the midst of a massive fight for its rightsdemonstrators were ubiquitous violence was in the air there were scores of visiting workers from core and other organizations in the company had played to an overflow audience it seemed as if the entire black community came the bogalusa chief of police had brought his men to observe outside the union hall the company had entered and left bogalusa under armed escort by the deacons for defense now all the visiting rights workers have retired to their own bags the only remaining workers are the bogalusa voters league led by robert hicks and a z young since bogalusa is only miles from new orleans we had decided to take several workshop kids to the show dick schechner tulane drama review editor who had been influential in the move of fst to new orleans in drove another car it was very dull we shot pool in the afternoon the summer was coming to an end without the kind of harassing arrests and incipient violence that accompanied the tour after the show we who were returning to new orleans the company was remaining in bogalusa to play the next night requested deacon escort for a few miles as a precautionary routine we were asked to wait for the escort in a local cafe after about an hour the deacons still had not appeared then charles sims their leader burst in he said there had been a shooting in another section of town there might be danger we would have to wait a while longer nothing to worry about he assured us mr young came in rushed to a telephone there was buzzing outside hurried anxious conversations weapons were visible the athlete of our workshop group said just get me to lake ponchartrain bordering new orleans and ill run the rest of the way mile bridge we sat around gloomily waiting finallysims returned said lets go lead driver follow meturn it on one of our cars will trail bogalusa stinksfrom the paper millbut if you can forget that the highway to new orleans is a lovely green shadowed drive at night the shadows hang like ghosts the highway from bogalusa is the loveliest in louisiana we sped out about am on to lake ponchartrain and new orleans black country theater usa the free southern theater is now evolving toward a black community theater this course has been determined as much by the experiences of the fst during its three years in the south as the theoretical beliefs of the company of course black community theater is one of those terms like black_power which can mean different things to different people lets take a step backward and look at fst properly within the broader perspective of the black artist in america not only does the black artist work in a society basically hostile to the aspirations of his people but he has little audience among his own people especially the writer and actor we tend to forget that literature and theater are first mediums albeit highly sophisticated of communication and the art of drama and literature is always extremely influenced by the attitudes and values of the audience we take this principle for granted but it has a special meaning for the black american writer for the black american writer writing for a primarily white audience usually imposes a serious limitation on the choice of approaches to his material we could reduce these approaches to two far too monoleveled bags neatly bound either the writer satisfies the demands and assumptions of the white audience or he as several are now successfully doing attacks the assumptions of the white audience with a hostility that at least satisfies the need to reject a society built on racial and other hypocrisies for the black actor performing in theaters owned controlled and supported by the white establishment means performing in a commercial atmosphere totally divorced from the culture which produced him and almost always becoming involved in a vehicle which must make money from white theatergoers to survive and even these jobs are very rare only a theater which plays for and to the black community can alter this situation thus open up new possibilities for black writers absolutely essential contact between the writer and the people he is writing about is reestab w lished thus the fundamental communication between artist and audience becomes possible such a theater offering the multiplicity of disciplines unique to theater can provide a conduit for the exploration of new themes and patterns which have really never been explored by our writers because this particular relationship between writer and audience has always been absent and if such a theater is even moderately financially successful it means jobs for black actors under conditions conducive to the development of an art not merely a commerce experience with the fst which has been playing to per cent black audiences affirms the necessity for a theater so integrated into the issues and immediacies of the communitv that it becomes func tional and necessary and the experience of playing for black audiences also proves that the particular form of attack on the status quo employed by white artists such as the beats and the folk music crowd are not usually relevant to the problems of the black community also too often the particular form of rage employed by black writers against american facism designed for a white audience is not usually successful when applied to a black audience this means black theater will demand new plays written for black audiences it also suggests that alliances with white artists lose their value when such alliances man the sacrifice of our racial concept of reality any of this could be developed further by analyzing for instance the dilemmas of the black writer on the lower east side of manhattan scene or by analyzing the extent to which black theater or the black writer is of necessity more involved with a political and social art i would define black community theater as a theater which exists for and relates specifically to the black communities and which performs a critical function toward the values of white america and the values of the community of which it is a part that other thing which has at some points existed in the afro communities we may call negro thespian culturaluplife theater which is not what i have in mind the fst in began to move in the direction outlined above particularly because of the urging of founding director gil moses the program was modified to choose plays which had a particular relevance to our audience with postperformance discussions retained to evaluate effectiveness and break down the distance between stage and audience devote more time to new orleans through workshops in drama afroamerican literature and writing and to hire the most interested and talented teenagers as apprentices build a theater in the desire project section of new orleans suitable for both performances and an office though the season involved the most extensive schedule of performances it would be misleading to claim the realization of all the above objectives the full potential of the workshop program can only be exploited when the company can obtain a fulltime black community workshop specialist who if funds are available can stay in new orleans on a fullyear basis the workshop program is extremely important it means planting seeds which will not only insure the life of the theater as an indigenous community force but also planting seeds which will perform the essential functions of racial reeducation reevaluation and strength and to make the program work the fst needs funds to spend more time in the south than the seven months it was able to operate in it would also be misleading to imply that the changes in direction came easily in a company which has from its inception established its own artistic principles through vigorous debate redirection of program took a tremendous emotional toll a definition of principle no matter how simple it may sound when stated here required a reevaluation of the role of fst so fundamental that only the obvious need for such a theater saved the company from dissolution in the black community is there a need for theater at all when so many other needs seem to take precedence are workshops which have the advantage of dealing more directly with the community more valuable than performances what is the role of the white actor if any in a theater which is designed for the black community is traditional theater too refined or removed to capture the immediacies of the black community once the company resolved some of these issues and avoided floating away on the waves of perpetual theoretical discussion four shows were prepared gil moses aforementioned roots our own poetry show utilizing the works of contemporary afroamerican and african poets does man help man by brecht and i speak of africa by william plomer played as a doublebill the most critical and enthusiastic audiences are not the new york sophisticates familiar with theater or the drama but people who relate in the most natural and sophisticated way to what happens on the stage that is when the theater accepts the obligation to present something which relates to the lives of the audience and does it well sometimes the discussions were more entertaining than the shows the poetry show almost precipitated what would have been an extraordinary scuffle between lovely denise nicholas and a booker t washington black policeman in a desire church does man help man provoked a sncc staffer to threaten to slap down a morehouse prefreshman in atlanta as success means audience community involvement this is the measure of success as the fst approaches its season there is for the first time solidity of structure and enough funds to enable planning for a few months last year the company received a grant from the rockefeller foundation which made possible the extension of the season through june july august and september this year the rockefeller foundation awarded fst a followup grant of the amount for three seasons earmarked for each year to decrease annually approximately is budgeted for the new york foundation has also contributed thus with a budget of roughly after bills are paid the fst is assured of a six or sevenmonth season paying approximately twelve people an average of per week this money does not include allowance for a workshop director in new orleans for more than the six or seventh month the company will be able to stay together for the workshop program to work the community director shuld really operate on a yearround basis the current budget also does not include funding for apprentices teenagers who can only afford to spend time with fst if they are paid because all of them need summer jobs if we cant pay them theyll get a cleaning job somewhere to conclude that the present budget provides for more than a minimum program would be an illusion to augment financing the board of directors has worked to expand its friends of the fst committee in new york and to create a similar group in new orleans led by mrs celestine cook mrs lucille segre and rev milton upton approval of federal tax exemption on gifts to fst has been an encouragement but the fst has hardly received generous financial support from people in new orleans the friends groups are also important for as the theater continues to play a politically and racially controversial role it may be very likely that foundation support will cease at the same time it is important that the fst remain a free theater because only a theater which performs without

this paper will deal with three subjects race war and politics t i believe they have always determined the direction of this nation i believe we stand on the brink of catastrophe right now because of them one hundred and ninetyone years ago war was the mother of our country we were born of violence the politics of revolution were spearheaded by men who believed in the dignity of man but being economically subordinate to england robbed them of that we know that those intellectuals pondered long and with both logic and emotion about the status of a man who was a man a white man was of course a man but an indian a negro slave or free the question was left hanging and we are still dealing with it within and without the nation liberty yes freedom but of course for some but not for all let me take you back to a short time before our rebellion really got under way let me take you to boston and to crispus attucks chris attucks one of the first men to die in the boston massacre was charged with starting the riot but did he in fact by his actions instigate the massacre there are some sidelights that should speak for themselves first of all chris attucks was a runaway slave he was over six feet tall and they used to tell stories about his knockknees it seems unlikely that a runaway slave would draw attention to himself by leading a mob through boston streets and look what patriot was going to allow himself to be led by a black man anyway in any case attucks died when a column of british soldiers opened fire in king street he died instantly with two others eleven other people were wounded and two of these died later john adams above the protests of the citizens defended the soldiers and declared attucks appears to have undertaken to be the hero of the night and to lead this army with banners to form them up in the first place in dock square and march them up to king street with clubs it was attucks to whose mad behavior in all probability the dreadful carnage of this night is chiefly to be ascribed the attorney for the people samuel adams however revealed that attucks was leaning upon a stick when he fell which certainly was not a threatening posture did john adams long a prominent figure in massachusetts politics find in attucks a scapegoat a corpse could not speak for itself and wasnt it easier to charge the provocation of the incident on a dead negro slave than on a live white patriot we do not know we can only surmise what we do know is that attucks now enshrined in copper on the boston commons became one of the martyrs of the rebellion and the colonists needed martyrs whether they were black white or red three years later speaking of red persons crept aboard three ships in boston harbor and threw overboard cases of tea this was the old boston tea party of course the members of the party were disguised as indians why the disguises why those disguises the british werent afraid of indians they had beaten them rather badly in the french and indian wars no our patriots in order to evade detection participated in a charade of racism put the blame on the negro put the blame on the indian our minds bend naturally in that direction anyway because they have different color skins and they above all are the most vulnerable people in our society racism was a part of our national psychology before the constitution was framed from boston harbor we advance to concord bunker hill and lexington if you remember your history you know that it was every state militia for itself and every town for itself congress hadnt been formed yet there was no such thing as an american army and politics were local choose any of these shrines of liberty peer into the nearby brush or any woodpile that served as cover and yes you did find a negro therein both woodpile and brush ill only bore you with a few names peter salem salem poor cuff whittemore cato stedman cato bordman some of the northern slave owners liked greek and roman names while others had no imagination at all for some of the black patriots bore names like george negro charles negro emmanuel negro and negro james these black militiamen did just as well as the black gi is doing in vietnamonly they didnt have television in those days or high speed printing presses so not many people knew about it but when the plans for a unified war were made black militiamen were ordered to turn in their guns and clubs because the colonies decided that it would be too dangerous and unwise to keep them armed whether they were slave or free besides it looked as though there might be such a thing as an american army then there would be a lot of white men to fight for this precious thing called freedom thus it was quite natural for slaves to gather in the roads in the dust of the riders who called out to arms to arms the british are coming the british promised to free the slaves if they joined the redcoats and they did to such an alarming extent that the continental congress which was having trouble rounding up all the patriots anyway now that the fighting was to be in earnest reversed its field and once more black soldiers found their way into the ranks of the fighting men some of them historian walter millis points out that it was embarrassing to the patriots to be fighting for liberty while maintaining the institution of slavery it was almost equally embarrassing on the other hand to be accused of raising a servile army to fight libertys battles for them many american commanders complained about their troops general philip schuyler wrote from saratoga in complaining that one third of the soldiers he had been sent were boys old men and negroes of course later he wrote they disgrace our arms is it consistent with the sons of freedom to trust all to be defended by slaves under the command of horatio gates the americans won a decisive battle over the british at saratoga what would general schuyler have to say if he were in vietnam today i wondernegroes continued in the ranks until the war was won we had liberty now and freedom we were independent but we still had slavery and in fact most of the black soldiers who were slaves were not set free for their services they were returned to slavery it is no wonder that the rhodesian unilateral declaration of independence sounds so much like ours within just a few years we found ourselves in trouble again the british and french although engaged in a war with each other were busily impressing our seamen we were only half as disturbed by that as by the prospect of snitching a bit more land from them while they were scrapping so the impressment of our sailors gave us the excuse and we rushed northward to canadaonly to be repulsed by the british and their allies the poor worthless indian we just barely saved our skins up there we never did get canada our sea forces saved us and fortunately for us we did manage to win two or three important land battles but the going was so rough that the new england states threatened to secede from the union the war was not very popular there that war of then we got lucky and won a few down south at new orleans andrew jackson who had had to issue a call for negro volunteers to help repel the british who had landed in finally threw them back if jackson had lost the british would have had a foothold in the south with access to florida still held by spain the land acquired by america through the revolution and the treaty of and the great land mass of the louisiana purchase if youre ever down around louisiana back country and you hear someone speak of freejacksyoull know that these negroes are the descendants of the free negroes who fought with jackson we need not go into the mexican war except to say that after texas became independent it stood outside the union for almost years it took that long to decide whether texas should be a slave state or a free state it came in as a slave state now we approached the civil war our past had been marked by expansion a sloppy foreign policy brought about in part by the distance between washington and european capitals the pioneer had become the early westerner the factories of the north bursting with energy and raw materials were famished for manpower and much of it came from abroad the indentured white servant was vanishing the slave trade had been halted but slavery continued with about slaves mostly in the south our ties to france and great britain were adequate and some of this was due to the cotton we were producing down on the old plantation then mr lincoln went into the white house now he had made clear his position on slavery he had expressed sympathy for the slave but he also made it clear that if one race had to be superior then he preferred that white men hold that position the south was not convinced they did not believe this was due to mr lincolns equivocating on the issue and so we entered the war drawn by south carolina on a winter night in the north possessed per cent of the population along with over per cent of all the factories it produced per cent of the nations wealth held per cent of all the bank deposits and owned per cent of all the farms the south could put into the battlefield only a little over a million white males between the ages of and the north on the other hand had white males of the same ages but the souths great slave population made the difference for it allowed the southerners to release for duty a larger number of white males than the north could spare from its industrial complexes two hundred thousand negroes in regiments fought for the union in the civil war and it was the opinion of many people that without those negroes the south would have won its independence before the north was reeling from the effect of confederate victories and general sherman said nobody can save the country our men are not good soldiers they brag but they dont perform what is in store for us i dont know president lincoln sent out a call for menand got less than in five weeks by the end of summer he saw but one course he wrote i now determined upon the adoption of the emancipation policy and without consultation with or the knowledge of the cabinet i prepared the original draft of the proclamation and after much anxious thought called a cabinet meeting on the subject secretary of state william seward who later would provide a house for harriet tubman was horrified he cried it may be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted governmen a cry for help the government stretching forth its hand to ethiopia instead of ethiopia stretching forth her hand to the government lincoln then delayed the proclamation but the second union defeat at bull run forced him to stretch forth the hand of his government to ethiopia he issued the emancipation proclamation on january states and locales fighting on the union side were allowed to keep their slaves by august of lincoln could write the use of colored troops constitutes the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion to another correspondent he wrote drive back to the support of the rebellion the physical force which the colored people now give and promise us and neither the present nor any coming administration can save the union navy secretary gideon wells said there is an unconquerable prejudice on the part of many whites against black soldiers but all our increased military strength comes from them since the proclamation did not free all the slaves a thirteenth amendment was necessary a decade after the war the south was back in the hands of the rebels where it still is and the process of inventing a creature called the negro moved into a brand new and ugly phase perhaps it was so ugly in the south because the southerner knew that this black man this slave had turned the tide against him this was the most important war in our history and all we give our school children from it is that mr lincoln freed the slaves what the hell kind of history is that the facts are available and they speak for themselvesand very loudly this would have been a very different country if it had not been for blacks whose descendants are still screaming for the same liberty they made possible for white people over years ago if we had recognized that fact and honored that very real obligation it might have changed the course of our history within and without from the very beginning they say that the longest journey begins with but a single step perhaps we took that step with crispus attucks and the boston tea party quite probably even before without how did we fare we had the monroe doctrine but that was unilateral and supported by the british because they held like commercial interests with ours this british participation blocked the attempts of the holy alliance of the great powers in europe to extend its influence into the western hemisphere the alliance collapsed in which was why when the civil war began those europeans could take the time to pick and choose a possible winner and cast lots with him two years after the war we bought alaska from russia for one penny an acre or a little over at this same time france was ending a war in mexico and the british were preparing to consolidate in africa the claims made by its many explorers and missionaries a new confederation was established in north germany and the francoprussian war was about to begin everyone for the time being was busy a new era was in the making while the british and french despite their differences and the germans as well were striving for new territories in africa we pushed westward our dark continent was our own west of chicago and kansas city while the europeans were busily slaughtering andor converting the heathen in africa and asia we set about doing the same in the west we had to link the east and west coasts we had to put down rails so the trains could run somebody said there was more gold and silver and more of our eastern citizens came west there were already some people out here they were indians and they were in the way the trains couldnt run safely the wagon trains were in danger the miners couldnt dig gold and fight at the same time there was only one answer we had cleared the eastern seaboard of the indian and we could do it in the west we made bad treaties with the indians the kind of treaties we wouldnt offer a white man and we killed them they killed some of us too but we did the better job wed brought over the chinese to help build the railroads and when they were finished we shipped them back or in any case passed an immigration law that wouldnt allow any more chinese into the country in the meantime we ran the indians to death and when we didnt we put them on reservations the sorry thing for black people about what was done to the indians was that four negro regimentstwo infantry and two cavalryhelped do it as a matter of fact if george armstrong custer had accepted the colonelcy he was offered in the ninth cavalry regimentnegrohe might not have wound up dead at little big horn with the seventh for all that we did to the indian there are still regions in this nation where the population density is far less than persons per square mile we could have lived with the indian he became for generations of white children the object of fantasy upon which they demonstrated their masculinity and superiority that is whenever they tired of negro objects all the movies and television aside we know that the indian did win some battles we also know that we beat him not always by force of arms and men but by treachery the kind of treachery in which we rationalized away the inherent racism of this nation you know we look upon ourselves as a peaceloving people our slogans of peace are always in the air always on the lips of our leaders but in fact this is a myth we must destroy in order to look at ourselves and see what we really are since our armies have managed to acquire more square miles on this globe by naked military power than any other nation except great britain it has been a neck and neck race between the british and the americans with the british seizing square miles and the americans square miles in both cases most of this mileage was taken from people who were not of anglosaxon heritage we had now entered the time of the weak presidents they were men about whom nothing much can be said except that they did the best they could they were probably better officers in the union army than they were politicians except cleveland and arthur who had not seen military service the major political parties that had crossed the horizon since were almost down to the two major parties of today immigration to the united states was reaching floodtide and the oppressed europeans became an american with a vengeance while the south was recapturing the political machinery the negro had held for only a brief time in the north a new kind of politics came into being the m local politician the district leader became the hyphenated americans pipe line to direct political action the new american countedsometimes even if he lay dead under a tombstone negro americans lost all voice in the politics of the south and therefore in the nation and as a result a century and four years after the emancipation proclamation the politics of the south remain unrepresentative of all the people of that region that condition does not hurt the south or hurt the blacks alone it wounds all of us and the larger wound is perhaps still to come consider that tonight in the south or in one of the northern ghettos there is a negro boy or girl who given the chance could find a cure for cancer the political action of the south created a political reaction in the north to which the negro fled southern political imbalance is being balanced out in the great cities of this nation and as whites leave those cities for the suburbs the blacks more and more are being left behind to determine the politics of cities like new york chicago detroit and san francisco and the more they determine politics the more sullen grows the rest of the nation this as history has proved and is proving still is traditional there is something about nonwhite people holding power that makes us terribly uneasy close to the turn of the century we once again took advantage of someone elses misfortune flexed our muscle and went in to help the little guy weve always managed to come out with more than we went in with this time it was the spanishamerican war we began our history there as a world power an empire we hadnt had a decent war in years and we were looking for one the insurrection of the cubans against spain gave us that opportunityand the explosion aboard the maine now considered to have been an accidentto enter the war on the side of the rebels we came out of that war with cuba puerto rico guam and the philippines we returned cuba to the spanish and since we were now in business in the pacific we picked up the hawaiian islands which by now were americandominated anyway some of our troops stationed in the philippines made a trip to the chinese mainland in to help put down the boxer rebellion the boxers resented the empress dowager tzu hsi and the foreigners she allowed to run the bulk of commerce in china the boxers whose name translated from the chinese means league of the united patriots killed several hundred foreigners therefore we joined the english russian german french and japanese armies to force the chinese to let us conduct business in their land the white nations allowed japan to participate in this business deal because the japanese were militarily strong the strongest nation in the east in another four years japan was destined to win a war with russiasomething the combined armies of europe under napoleon couldnt do the nations of the west were astounded but they recovered quickly enough to limit drastically the war claims of japan implanting in that nation a sense that it would never be dealt with fairly in the courts of the western governments in japan became a major nonanglosaxon military power and as the years wore on it was with some relief that the nations in the west let it work off its muscle in asia but first there was world war i a war we were drawn into not because we wanted to save european democracy as well as ours which in reality did not exist for millions of americans black and white and brown anyway but because we resented the efforts of the germans to loose not only the mexicans but the japanese upon us our president mr wilson feared the yellow peril as much as it intrigued kaiser wilhelm and after all we had treated the mexicans badly enough to fear that given the chance they would retaliate in kind eventually our policy of neutrality severely tested in many incidents finally had to go by the board and so we went to the war what was that war all about we know of the balance of power of assassinations of diplomatic skullduggery but was the war fought for pieces of europe really yes the germans did want to move south and east yes the russians did want to protect their black sea ports yes the french wanted to regain alsace and lorraine the japanese who came in on the side of the allies in still wanted manchuria however dr w e b du bois the late negro scholar and historian asserted that the real spoils of victory lay in africa not in europe african possessions gave a great amount of wealth to france england belgium and germany the slave trade had been the springboard by which england and then france came to their industrial revolutions and later imports from africa costing almost nothing to produce became major underpinnings in the economies of the european nations italy had a small colony in africa belgium spain and portugal held territories germany held lands in the east southwest and west nearly all the possessions were many times larger than the nations that owned them the congo for example was times larger than belgium and you could put france into algeria about five times africas a big place you can put the united states into it more than three times over the great rift valley in africa is longer than the united states is wide it was from the black mother that america secured its uranium which would light the sky over hiroshima and nagasaki in ten million people died in world war i in which almost american negro troops participated on a segregated basis the austrohungarian empire was broken up at the wars end and it became a series of feeble countries austria hungary czechoslovakia yugoslavia poland was declared independent rumania got a part of the old empire france got alsace and lorraine italy was given a bit of the rugged although very beautiful land north of its own boundary but these gifts had been gifts before in other times in short they were merely changing hands once again historian milton meltzer describes the end of the war when the negro soldiers returned homethe sound rolled up fifth avenue gathering power at every block the crowds packed on the sidewalks began to cheer as soon as the wave of noise hit their ears by the time they could see the two thousand gleaming bayonet tips far down the street they were yelling their welcome new yorks negro soldiers were back home the first american troops to go up front they stayed in the trenches consecutive days not one man was captured not one trench was surrendered not one foot of ground was given up they fought their way to the rhine they were the first american soldiers to win the highest french decoration the croix de guerre the entire regiment won it for gallantry under fire the next day a negro was lynched in georgia two negroes were lynched every day of that year which was nothing had changed for the negro but big changes were taking place in africa germany lost its colonies and they were taken over by the british and french and south africans japan did not receive the balance of manchuria instead it was given mandates over some islands of the pacific we would not know the names of those islands until world war ii mandates through the league of nations were a big item everyone got them on the other hand had germany won the war its new african colonies from france and england added to those it already held might have made unnecessary the quest for living space which led to the second world war ill make a flat prediction right now in the years ahead the dominant foreign influence in africaunless africa resists that intervention more strongly than it now iswill not be american or russian it will be german in the bewildering void being created between the americans and the russians the germans not the chinese are winning friends and influencing people the italians gained nothing new in africa for their service with the allies which was precisely why they returned to ethiopia in after having been beaten by the ethiopians in haile selassie is still the emperor of ethiopia in when i was ten years old there was a lot in the papers and on the radio about selassie and most of it was funny there was nothing funny about his going before the league of nations to protest italian activity on his borders the league sat on its hands and the italians invaded from a distance of years one can see that that action was a turning point in world history the sanctions the league applied to italy were useless the unwillingness and inability of the league to take meaningful action against italy finally broke that organization which was weak to begin with because we were not a member it can be assumed that if ethiopia had been a white nation the issue might have been better resolved as for us we wouldnt have cared less the degree to which white america oppressed the negro was astounding as horrible as were the deaths of the three civil_rights workers in neshoba county mississippi in and two of them were white you will recall believe me when i tell you that they died easily compared to the way a multitude of negroes were dying in the american south in the year we are above all racially consistent the spanish civil war began the following year and the league was unable to prevent the germans and italians from joining the conflict on the side of the monarchists we continued our isolationist binge choosing only to harass those americans who fought with the loyalists spain you see is where africa begins according to the seasoned traveller as far as the british are concerned the niggers begin at calais so the anglosaxons were pretty cool about what was going on in that latin country we watched divebombing tactics being perfected at guernica and believed they had nothing whatsoever to do with us the spanish people had elected a republican government and it was substituted in blood for an unlawful one which we have supported so we came still unprepared to world war ii we would go up against the blooded legions of the germans italians and japanesefor the japanese were finally taking the manchuria that neither the treaty of in which president teddy roosevelt was involvednor participation in world war i brought them like most western nations we were content to let the japanese and chinese fight it out what did it matter to us what those wiley oriental gentlemen did to each other as long as they didnt rock our boat while they were doing it ethiopia spain manchuria the great american depression inevitably there was hitler and the japanese militarists this time the japanese threat to our west coast was real so we went to war it is quite possible that if the japanese hadnt attacked pearl harbor we might not have gone to war despite the feeling of many government officials that we should have even before our navy was wrecked we didnt seem to care about hitlers camps or the ovens that would start snuffing out the lives of millions of people because they were jews communists homosexuals or antinazis we appeared to be content to stay in isolation lynching negroes oppressing mexicans and puerto ricans and working our way out of the depression hours after the attack on pearl harbor this nation came alive like a raging lion never again would we be isolated from the rest of the world we had at that time our finest hourand our worst we were at the same time heroes and racists while some americans were signing up others moved rapidly to isolate the japaneseamericanswe put over in camps confiscated their property and all too often divided it among ourselves but we were also at war with germany and italy from to there were more german immigrants to america than from any other nation italians made up six per cent of the population in new york new jersey and connecticut in new york and a few other large cities pronazi germanamericans paraded openly in the street and yet to the endless shame of this nation we imprisoned only the japaneseamericans why didnt we imprison german and italianamericans as well we know the reason for that dont we then we had the gall the absolute gall to ask the japaneseamericans to volunteer for combat in order to prove they loved this nation and damned if they didnt volunteer the nd regiment made up of japaneseamericans became the most decorated regiment in the army in world war ii we only had gall they had manhood as we all know after the blitzkrieg that brought europe to its knees the war continued on in north africa now all europe was hurting allied strategy first recommended that the attack be carried to hitlers fortress europe directly but that was changed and the battlefield became africa because the allies could not afford to let the germans hold it africa was the place where the european allies would have to begin anew if england fell we know that the french for a time did have their military headquarters there so once again africa became a focal point for the survival of western civilization from african victories the allies sprang to italy from italy into france and then on into germany in the pacific we fought a race war against the japanese and they fought one against us surely on the basis of our previous contacts with them wed given them few reasons to trust anglosaxons we did not try to hide our contempt for them and in the end against the advice of albert einstein we dropped the bomb on them yes we dropped the bomb on them and i believe that every nonwhite person on this miserable globe of ours is convinced that had the bomb been ready before the european war was over we still would have dropped it on the japanese and not the germans the japanese after all are not white they are not anglosaxon or caucasian seven hundred thousand american negro troops were engaged in the war against the italians germans and japanese again on a segre gated basis i was one of them we were lynched in the training camps set aside from white americans we were refused food in the restaurants of the south while german prisoners of war were welcomed with the battle of the bulge however out of necessity once more the army ground forces in europe became somewhat integrated it looked as though the germans were about to break through and every available man was needed with the war won we found ourselves the undisputed leaders of the world we were not used to such power such vast influence and we handled it like a hot potatowhich was exactly what it was roosevelt was dead and truman stood in his place the result of the might of the south no northern president could be elected unless his vice president was a southerner or a border state resident or a man whose policies indicated sympathy for the southern way of life these men who have run our nationand you think about this came to their power because of their positionshinted stated or unstatedon the racial dilemma of this land that has been going on for a long long time in my opinion harry truman proved to be a better president than we had a right to expect he did make decisions he ordered the bomb dropped he put in motion the marshall plan he offered some of the firstpostwar civil_rights legislation and for his pains the southerners created their dixiecrat party of this party was but one more product of american racial attitudes europe was in shambles but they didnt care much about that the bomb had been dropped and that didnt bother them too much but when it came to equality for the black american they really lost their cool as this socalled negro revolution ebbs and flows politicians are using it to advance themselves and to retard the country lets not be deceived by the slogans of nullification states rights crime in the streets and hoodlumism they all mean the same thing no equality for the negro as an american i would think that many other americans would grow sick and tired of what these attitudes have done to the nation and the world i would be tired of the cottonaccented or general americanaccented tones that mouth the outmoded concept of black inferiority i would be tired of the bilbos and faubuses the doubletalking northerners i would throw up my hands at the farce being perpetrated against the people of alabama today and quite possibly the rest of the nation tomorrow george and lurleen wallace however you slice it owe their doubtful preeminence to racial hatred and this hatred is a thing which act by act situation by situation has become a functioning and necessary part of our national psyche after the war we set up nato we were one of fourteen nations we had to carry the other the taxes of all americans went to europe to save it from communism we were so busy in europe that we almost forgot about our adventures in china and the rest of the orient we had to think about it again because the regime of chiang kai shek was that year swept to formosa by the communists once again we had backed the wrong horse i have mentioned the boxer rebellionthat was when the chinese man in the street rebelled against outsiders capturing the commercial interests of his country we first went to china in following the opium wars in when was a kid there were a great many movies about the chinese being opium fiends they were the guys who when high on opium kidnapped the blonde blueeyed girls you know the bit the opium wars you may remember began because the british imported opium into china from places like burma the chinese government knew very well what opium could do to its people and resisted the british insisted on bringing it inat great cost to the chinese the chinese lost those wars opium not only flowed freely through the provinces but england france and the us were given freedom to call at the treaty ports of shanghai canton and others britain also gained hong kong it was a case of the west ramming down the throat of the east not what was good for the orientals but what was good and damned profitable for caucasians in washington dc the newsmen still remember with great fondness the china lobby of chiang kai shek it gave the most splendid parties in town girls booze and excellent chinese food were available for the asking only in did it become crystal clear that chiang was through we woke up late surprisingly late to the information that people who were not white could adopt a modern social order such as communism and when we did wake up we didnt know where to begin as late as when african nations were becoming independent we still didnt know what to do so we reverted we tried to pay africa and africans as we have done with the rest of the world to play ball with us but in china there were now about million souls ruled by a political philosophy that was alien to us counting russia far over a billion ideological enemies not counting the sovietbloc nations so seven years after we signed the nato pact we had to go to manila and draw up a similar contract with eight nations this time we called the contract the southeast asia treaty organization and it was signed in the same year that france also a member of seato was concluding its war in vietnam one year before we had reached an uneasy truce in korea what an odd lot that seato organization brought together america with her domestic racial problems and a neophyte in world relations which added up to insincerity and fumbling in our comer were the philippines a very obvious us satellite in the pacific there was france just beaten in vietnam splendidly democratic at home but its racial policies abroad left much to be desired great britain was there of course with two members of the commonwealth australia and new zealand australias racial policies were approaching those of south africa and our own american south then there was pakistan and thailand the pakistani people feel the brunt of much of the british racism when they are in england the great powers of the west sat down with these little countries and wrote out a pacific charter affirming the rights of asian and pacific peoples to equality and selfdetermination the antiaggression and economic provisions were extended in vietnam we were building a ring around china then just as we had created a ring of allies around russia we thought we could isolate communism shut it off from the rest of asia and the world we had discovered during the korean war that we were faced with an implacable enemy a people who were glad to build our railroads do our laundry and serve fortune cookies in cute little restaurants smelling of strange teas but no more korea was first colonized by the chinese in the th century and down through the years both the chinese and japanese fought over it the japanese took it over as a result of their war with russia korea was promised to the chinese during the cairo conference in but when the war was over the country was occupied by the americans in the south and the russians in the north then governments were set up north and south the rest is history we went to war there with our first integrated army and with the aid of united nations troops the war was a draw the country is still divided at the th parallel we began to form rings around china and there was much talk about the implausibility of conducting a land war in china we hoped and prayed that the yellow heathenthat is save chiang kai shek whom we were still supporting on formosawould not get their hands on the knowhow to make the bomb we still had that advantage i am an american seven generations in this land i am an afroamerican if you will i am a student of history a victimas we all areof life i am a father and husband and i am a writer and i believe a responsible citizen therefore what i have to say next i do not say lightly most americans have never been troubled by the great gap between the american creed and the american deed and i do not believe my words are going to change things one bit i wish they could but i know they wont it seems that all the words have been used upused so often that we respond only to the sound and not the meaning of them the american history of racism it is my firm conviction and i have tried to give a sketch of it has brought us today to a confrontation with deadly possibilities not with north vietnam but with china it is not the philosophy of communism that we fear any longer one has only to witness the degree to which we have managed to coexist with it and even managed to thrive because of it we have had opportunities to crush it we were in russia during world war i only when we were in danger in world war ii did we help them weve always gotten along well with tito the hungarians expected us to return to europe when they revolted but we didnt what makes us uneasy about the philosophy of communism is that it has great appeal with some modification to strange people like the dominicans cubans and africans but we can put up with them because after all they have not got the bomb the chinese have got the bomb they have got the bomb and this means that for the first time in history people who are not white are capable of administering almost as much death and destruction as white people the balance no longer is no white nation on this earth can claim to have been nice to the mainland chinese none and now we may force them to seek redress of grievances before i finish with china however let me go to south vietnam we have almost half a million troops there as far as we have been told and close to of them are negro many others are puerto rican a goodly number are rural white kids from the south ask a soldier what he is doing in vietnam and hell probably tell you hes defending freedom and democracy how dare we in the year with the socalled negro revolution climbing right up our backs and threatening to rip this country apart talk of freedom and democracy in vietnam there must be places within miles of most of us now where a negro gi just back from vietnam cannot stop to eat or sleep i know there are where i come from what are we doing in vietnam when here at home out of every thousand black babies die within a year of life while in vietnam out of every thousand die what are we doing burning homes children women and the aged who did not ask us to come in the first placeall they wish is relief from their landlords and why are black gis dying at the rate of per cent of the total casualties while making up only a bit over per cent of the population many of those boys have died without having a cup of watery coffee in an integrated five and dime storeso that many americans can have the privilege of exercising a sickening item called white backlash so what are we doing there involved in an undeclared war and without our major allies france and england this war is without slogans because the real reason for it is rooted in what we say we despise race hatred we are trying to draw china into a war i believe i think we have come to believe that we must before china finds the capability for delivering its bomb to the american mainlandor to russiawho one day will be our major ally vietnam is nothing it is an expensive excuse nothing more how can we be concernedhow can the vietnamese in the south expect us to be concernedwith their distant people when we have amply demonstrated to the entire world and for over years time and time again that we do not basically care for the black and brown millions in our own midst what we want is for the chinese to reach over and knock the chip from our shoulder wed like them to invade the south but if they dont we might invade the north and try to draw them down but they are sly yellow devils arent they they wont bite because they know that if they do we might unsheath a few of those metal monsters we will keep escalating until they do bite because we insist we have got to get them before they get us white power not yellow power must prevail and we have a justifiable sense of guilt about what we have done to the nonwhite world we just dont want to pay for it but nature contains its own awful balance john a williams author of the article race war and politics is one of americas leading novelists his newest book the man who cried l am which was completed in spain last winter is scheduled for publication this fall last spring his expanded and updated anthology beyond the angry black was published mr williams other books include the novels sissie and night song and the autobiographical travel book this is my country too the above article was delivered as an address at colorado state university i talk to friendly white people for the first e f time or for any length of time and often when i talk to f young black people and usually when i talk to anybody ab ut the blues i realize the vast and tragic gaps in our c understanding of the negro experience in america this is particularly evident in the current misunderstanding of the nature and dimensions of black consciousness one aspect of which black_power has received inordinatebecause distortedattention from the mass media it strikes me as strange that there should be such misunderstanding of black aspiration from literate people who really should know better for this insistence upon black consciousness of which black_power is a solid but flashy single factor is not unconnected with what has gone on before and what in effect has been sanctioned before by the literate public for example when richard wright said that he was a black boy and delineated that condition and refused to be a nigger when ralph ellison said that he was an invisible man when james baldwin said that nobody knew his name they spoke in powerful and moving and eminently distinctive voices for when wright asserted his blackness and repudiated his niggerness it was an act of personal purgation when ellison said that he was invisible it was an indictment and a challenge and when baldwin said that nobody knew his name it was a warning one need not belabor baldwins prophetic precision when this juxtaposition is obvious the fire next time burn baby burn or the fact that wright used the words black_power as the title for a book which in its reflection of essentially a white mans view of africa revealed the price he paid for integration and the repudiation of his niggerness or that ironically ellison was making invisibility a metaphor for blackness and incidentally for niggerness and black consciousness or that the whole socalled black movement on the social and political level at least is a series of exercises in strategic visibility or as ellison and leroi jones say so well black is blue the paradigm of the negro experience is the blues but when people talk about blues they usually talk about sociology or personal anecdote or about music usually jazz i submit that while it involves all these things it is also poetry at times of great profundity and if we examined it as such we would find out that black consciousness has been around for a long time and is likely not only to endure but to seducewhich is to say to prevail i have used the words nigger and niggerness in the same breath with black consciousness and i am pretty sure that most people who talk about black consciousness would probably repudiate any connection of this sort yet oddly enough these same people are searching for their roots in the folk culture of which the blues are a crucial part and the main burden of the blues is doing it and dues now all white people know that negroes are sexual prodigies though only a few white people know what negroes mean by paying dues schwerner and goodman and reeb and mrs liuzzo knew too well now white people also know what they mean when they say nigger after all they invented the word and the thing for a refresher here is a letter to eugene patterson the editor from the october issue of the atlanta constitution in when the students of virginia union university began picketing the stores with lunchcounters in downtown richmond someone sent the president a picture of a black gorilla charging through the african bush scrawled in huge letters were the words nigger this is you meanwhile in the newspapers the good people of virginia vented their venom while editorials spoke in unsubtle praise of carlton putnams race and reason in short a nigger is a bom halfape in hitlers phrase with rheumatism in all his joints and of course niggers are diseased and depraved something like swifts yahoos and they stink so as the american nazis say who needs niggers who indeed ask the old negro and he replies nobody and he tells his children stop acting like niggers and when he is disgusted with his folks he says just like niggers yet he also uses the word in a neutral sense to mean negro or as a term of affection to his very dear friend or even his wife warily he may allow his white friends to use the word in his presence to show that he is integrated sometimes in a kind of brotherly euphoria he even allows a special white friend jokingly to call him nigger who needs niggers ask the young blackman and he might cuss you out or knock you down no more of that never no goddamn more and he reminds you of the young richard wright yet the young blackman uses the word too quite often in the same manner that the old negro does though if he is a young blackman and not just a young negro chances are few white people even his closest friends would dare call him nigger and when he calls himself that or his friends there is an ironic distance in his voice which calibrates precise emotional reactions as in his use of the shortened form nig or the nig moreover despite his highly specialized use of the term and his repudiation of the white mans definition the young blackman in his concern with shattering stereotypes either consciously or unconsciously ventures into forms of speech dress and behavior which would elicit from the old negro the expression of resigned self contempt just like a nigger and in attempting to assert his independence of the white man in declaring his freedom as a natural man he deliberately courts at times it seems the white mans scorn so as to declare it irrelevant to his personal worth and freedom and so the repudiation of black and white middleclass values alike he takes a long hard look as it were at the idea of niggerness and because it embodies some of the deepest fears of western white men he discovers that it is useful he can use it as the basis of a new concept of self he can not only use it as the old negro did he can also use it as a weaponagainst the physical ghetto yes whether you condone his actions or not but also and more importantly against the ghettos of the mind and so in turning back to his roots as he says it he challenges the stereotypes sometimes he transforms them and with this transformation comes change in others around him old negroes and whitefolks alike he doesnt have to turn far before he comes to the blues the devil songs of doing it and dues for in them he finds the ancestral record of otherness or if you please of niggerness i have isolated vhnt i consider to be the main burden or themes of the bluesphysical iove with or without romance and suffering or doin it and dues a good example of what im talking about is a blues by furry lewis the great memphis blues singer and teacher of bessie smith he sings in white lightnin this is a very moving and typical blues some of it consists of standard blues lines which furry has assimilated and appropriated for his own use but the juxtaposition and the powerful condensation of feeling make it quite personal in the opening lines the terrible and paradoxical words reflect a mental state quite close to the alienation so often expressed in modem literature fix my breakfast so i can go to bed hes been up all night drinking trying to cure the blues we dont know what the cause is but it seems a fundamental despair both physical and philosophical so powerful that he has tried to erase it with the alcohol how appropriately then the name suits the mood and the stunning effect of the alcohol is like the paralyzing force of the blues themselves he has suffered as it were a double strokefrom the blues and from the white lightnin the next logical step physically should be sleep metaphysically death since the words are announced with all the anguish of physical and spiritual exhaustion before the second stanza he plays a boogiewoogie figure the music of copulation which announces a different kind of resolution and the language following after typical blues boasting standard blues lines implies a paradoxical and witty comment on the original mood suddenly he revives from the blue paralysis and is readyto take on a chocolate broad any one but the lines imply that he is already riding and what hes hauling is his own sweet chocolate which has burst through the paralysis as his life revives but the fear of the blues is there even in the act of regeneration it has made and will make him so desperate that he will do everything he can for the woman be good to her and for her then the boogiewoogie ride is over and the same train that hauled chocolate to the bone takes her away from him literally and logically there are inconsistencies of person and tense which confuse the literal meaning the baby in the first stanza is probably not the same as in the fifth and we moved from the immediate opening mood and place home in the present to another location in the present where he is trying to get someone to go home with him to still another place in the present presumably home where he mourns over someone who had left him in the past but the unity is one of mood and one which follows the laws of associationfrom the paralysis of the first two stanzas to the sexual solution of the three middle stanzas to the resignation of the last which implies a groping for something beyond love and an acceptance of the impermanence of love it takes us to the mysterious despair of the opening this obviously is not a mere longing for sex since the woman is already there so what then is this terrible despair that drives a man to oblivion it is the blues the characteristic cumulative effect of blackness in the united states its not just the background of jazz not just a sound the brown sound of the british rock and rollers nor simply a hybrid music which gropes for the quarter tones of african modalities nor is it a simple record of the more palatable and romantic aspects of blackness the soul of black folks in america it is again the characteristic effect of blackness in the united states and blackness in the united states means niggernessand niggerness is among other things a diseasethe disease of absurd otherness and the blues song is an existential record both of the symptoms and of the treatment it is a kind of homeopathya treatment of poisoning with a bit of the poison itself the live virus that makes the vaccine work thus any serious search for roots and black identity has to come fully to grips with this experience not just to isolate it and forget it but to incorporate it into a larger conception of self now make no mistake about it the blues experience this niggerness is a terrible disease it can kill dont sentimentalize that furry doesnt its a disease that lurks dormant in the blood even when apparently cured like malaria or syphillis and the price of the cure is so painful so great that you wouldnt in your right mind go out and catch it again now if this scourge this blues this niggerness is so terrible if it has been inflicted upon us for all these years if it has infected the whole social and political body of this country and damaged its soul in the process and if we have survived because we were too damn mean to crynot only because we got good religion but because we got good bread then we shouldnt ever forget the experience because it is a part of our uniqueness we shouldnt ever forget the experiences of niggerness the whole range of it if anything we should celebrate it ritualistically as the jews do passover or yom kippur if we are to be whole as a people we must in our new black pride as young black folks seem unconsciously to be doing acknowledge the full nature of the disease and transform it not pretend that it never existed for if it had never existed we never would have developed immunity there is a good deal of glib talk nowadays about telling it like it is often by people who dont know what it is and increasingly young black people will be unable to see it like it is because their music will have had its vitality filtered through fashionable mainstream interpretations and they themselves will as they attain middle class respectability theorize and romanticize the guts out of their ancestral experience in this country precisely at a time when it needs to be remembered they have to remember again the entire spectrum of blacknessthe negative part in the mind of white america and the selfhatred the selfabnegation the selfsurrender the selfrealization in their own anything less than this m and it has to be held simultaneously in the mindis less than the truth if its less than truth then its not whole but unhealthy diseased at worst niggerness without the blues this takes us back to the mysterious despair of furrys first stanza for the realization of the absurdity of niggerness can come at any time it can even come in church where it may be transmuted into a longing for godbecause the mechanism is there but when the religious mechanism isnt there it comes out like it isthe blues now in their churches european people and educated negroes call their blue feeling angst and philosophize learnedly about the death of god but the blues singer knows all about that and has been saying it for a very long time he knows that angst is the blues for god but that god is white he knows absurdity with shattering intimacy he has also developed a mechanism to handle it an art form which celebrates the brutal thrust of love into the cavity of the absurd and precisely because they deal with the abyss the stinking pit of hell without the mediating presence of god precisely because they have been so efficiently and systematically rejected by the world the blues singersthe blues peoplelove and long so desperately there is for them no theological solutionno god to wipe away their tears only a train sixteen coaches long that dont haul nothin but chocolate to the bone at this point we run into a set of complications modern urban blues soul music white blues and rock and roll i believe that although the performance of the blues has changed the blues as black experience as poetry as recordhasnt by this i mean that the essential elements of doin it and dues are still there though perhaps in different proportions there is in effect much more of the former than of the latter especially in white singing which is often a kind of debasement a kind of shamminginstant anguish and perpetual orgasm but the same can be said of many negro presentations which tend toward artiness and prettiness and pop appeal but b b king and ray charles especially and now james brown otis redding and aretha franklinthey know about dues too and though their appeal rests largely on their virtuosityso did that of bessie smith and jimmy rushing and blind lemon jefferson and dinah washingtontheir story is still the story of the blues the disease and the serum finally it is important to make these distinctions now because the blues element in current soul music is so often swamped by the superficial adaptations of gospel rhythms melodies and lyrics and with the insistent imitation of negro sound by skillful whites the whole value structure implicit in the words of the blues is threatened for america has the midas touch which turns blue notes into goldleaf before the blues are pressed like childs english and scottish popular ballads into five static and esoteric volumes let us realizeespecially you young blackman bluethat their tragicomic vitality can still save us from cynical political posturing from the hoppedup rhetoric of brotherhood from the saccharine confusions of adrenalin and soul a strong case could be a p made for the hypothe sis that popular social movements do not apjzai ss ik pear unty gai s to which they address themselves are already in the process of being achieved put another way it may be suggested that changes in the afroamerican freedom movement have followed rather than preceded changes in the situation of black people for as the political economic and social conditions of black people have improved so has the movement gained momentum and become negro digest august more articulate sophisticated and complex the absoluteif not relative conditions of black people have indeed improved and this absolute improvement is at the very basis of the increasing momentum of the movement for to be sure throughout our history black people have known disadvantages and deprivation but in the face of it and in spite of it enough have managed to secure educations hold jobs move to greener pastures and increase our numbers to advance the absolute condition of the group parallel to this advance can be traced the rise of a positive black consciousness that found expression in a direct assault on segregation in the civil_rights movement and in the call for black_power with each change in the character of the movement has come an enlargement of its objectives and with each improvement in life conditions has come new insights into the nature of our situation and problems having secured a reaffirmation of our civil_rights we can see that these in themselves are not enough for we have also advanced far enough to clearly see that while our absolute situation has improved our group as a whole is not progressing as rapidly as others and that our people and communities face relative stagnation this realization of group stagnation in the face of individual advancement has contributed to a heightening of black consciousness and to a new change in the course of the movement an unmistakeable indicator of this change of course has been the emergence of the slogan black_power the slogan served brilliantly to dramatize one of the fundamental aspects of the realities that face black people in the united states that of relative powerlessness in a society that is organized upon power manipulation the emergence of such a captivating slogan represents an important phase of a group movement yet even the most brilliant slogan suffers a sever limitation a slogan directs attention to a situation or a set of objectives but it cannot provide the guidelines by which the objectives embodied in the slogan may be achieved to bring forth these guidelines we must bring forth an ideology for while a slogan draws attention to a reality and sounds a call for action an ideology provides a framework that integrates concepts ideas means and ends into a program for action in this respect black_power can be viewed as a slogan of the ideology of black nationalism black_power has become a household phrase and like most slogans it has come to mean many different and often contradictory things in the minds of many black people the differing opinions and contradictions nonetheless must be viewed as unavoidable necessary and even desirable for the unleashing of this particular slogan has initiated a great debate among black people which holds the promise of enlightening and of resolving many of the dilemmas that plague even the most resolute among us yet again if this debate is to prove fruitful we must move beyond the slogan to the development of a viable ideology it is in the spirit of this great debate that this essay embraces the slogan black_power and argues in favor of pluralistic black nationalism as an ideology to serve the needs of black people in the united states historically and geographically nationalism has been interpreted and modified to meet the particular conditions of particular times and places the basic concept in nationalistic ideologies has been that members of a group however defined believe that they themselves should control and manage their own affairs at the risk of oversimplification we will define afroamerican black nationalists as those who wish to preserve and develop black communities and institutions in both a physical and spiritual sense those who wish to maximize black political economic and social power in order to control protect and enhance black communities institutions and black people those who wish to conserve create and protect the integrity of black culture and those who view their identity proudly and positively put simply we define pluralistic black nationalism as positive black consciousness expressed in institutional and structural terms in using this formulation it becomes obvious that we are suggesting a new definition of black nationalismor and perhaps more accurately we are suggesting a new application of the concept this application of black nationalism includes many black people who do not think of themselves as black nationalists but whose actions and sentiments are nationalistic within the confines of our definition and application viewed from this perspective we can see that black nationalism has had a long history among afroamericans in terms of organized movements this history can be traced from the emigration movements of the early nineteenth century to marcus garvey in the s to the nation of islam today yet also using our definition and application we find a definite motif of undefined black nationalism which expressed itself in black consciousness and concern and reached its high points in the convention movements of the s in the black literary renaissance of the s and in the intellectual political cultural social and economic ferment that is today transforming black america throughout the great debate black_power and black nationalism have been equated with the notion of a physical separation of black people from the united states this is an overly narrow view and does not apply to the main body of nationalistic sentiment among afroamericans which seeks to participate more fully in the total society this narrow view is based upon the false assumption that nationalism refers only to nationstate creation or affairs nationalism however can also apply to the desire for nationality group unity and it can exist when a multiplicity of nationality groups share the same country beyond the situation in the united states this multiplicity of nationality groups can also be seen in the cases of the frenchcanadians and the greekcypriots most importantly then while nationalist movements may or may not be separatist they may also be nonseparatist or pluralist moreover as c eric lincoln put it black nationalism addresses itself not to an existent state but a state of mind and it is in terms of a pluralist american society that black nationalism is here discussed in ideal terms a pluralist society may be thought of as one where distinct groups peacefully coexist within a country on a basis of mutual cooperation respect and civil equality each group may maintain a set of institutions parallel to those of other groups through which it may pursue its own needs and cultural interests so long as these pursuits do not encroach upon the civil_rights of other groups yet we must not view pluralistic black nationalism as a variation of the separate but equal theme for quite the contrary pluralistic nationalism aims at complete desegregationnot segregation a pluralistic society is completely compatible with the principles and spirit of democracy for pluralism affirms democracy just as segregation repudiates it a pluralistic black nationalism ideology offers means ends and programs commensurate with the needs for structural and institutional development in the black communities our arguments for such an ideology stem from a consideration of the nature of black communities their relationships to other communities and their problems afroamericans constitute a virtual nation within a nation this can easily be seen objectively by noting the various indexes of segregation which show that residential neighborhoods are becoming increasingly homogenous in their racial compositions equally visible are the black institutions associations and organizations which exist parallel to those of whites and other racial groups these structural features serve to show that to a great extent american society is organized upon the basis of race and ethnicity for it is common practice to define political units school districts and economic markets in terms of the racial and ethnic composition of the residential neighborhoods and communities within them yet black communities and the institutions organizations and structures within them are underdeveloped and beset with a whole range of problems these problems are grounded in the structural features of american society to use an analogy in many ways the relationships between black and white communities are similar to those between neighboring countries and to carry the analogy a step further these relationships are like those between the highly developed and the still developing countries of the world but we must not carry the analogy of neighboring countries too far we exist in one country actually and contrary to popular opinion black people are not outside the mainstream of american society we are very much a part of and influenced by the structure of this society but as a group we are near the bottom of it we are prisoners of it and we are stagnating and very nearly drowning in its vicious structural cycles thus our problems stem from our relative position in the society not our membership in it the issue which confronts us is not one of choosing between participation in the mainstream of american society and developing our own communities for we must do both at the same time rather the issue is given our historical and present position what form should our relationships to the rest of this society take we choose to face this issue by arguing for pluralistic black nationalism on the basis of three of many reasons first this society is structured around groups and the strength they can muster other groups have already used their own nationalism to advance their groups position second for black people the methods available for advancement are all qualified by the racism that pervades the entire society any plan any coalition must take this racism into consideration black nationalism offers the advantage of ever reminding us to maximize our own strength in order that we may relate to others from a position of relative independence rather than near absolute dependence third black nationalism as we have defined itblack consciousness expressed in structural and institutional termsis in keeping with our situation needs and goals men pursue their goals through institutions organizations and structures to change our relative position in the structure of this society we must create larger more comprehensive and modern institutions of our own and in our own communities the structural features of american society have held us in a vicious cycle of stagnation therefore we need structures of our own to break out of the cycle and move ahead at a pace comparable to the rest of the society if black communities are to develop and prosper black consciousness must be channeled into viable structures and institutions for in this highly organized society an unorganized people can exert little influence but paradoxically all the ingredients for the development of viable institutional and organizational structures now exist in black communities except for a broadly based and widely understood ideology to coordinate our efforts forge the needed institutions and structures and lift our communities out of their relative stagnation we must face the unpleasant suspicion that we may have devoted more energy to attempting to enter the institutions of other groups than we have to developing our own we may have thus come perilously close to portraying ourselves as pawns rather than brokers the ingredients for development can all be foundand so can a catalystin pluralistic black nationalism despite our internal confusions and problems we are neither helpless nor inadequate to administer our own affairs our positions of powerlessness and deprivation are relative not absolute we do have both the actual and potential resources by way of example we will use the point of view of pluralistic black nationalism to explore two of the many potential areas of black development politics on the level of local organization and economic development in the retail sector pluralistic black nationalism and local political development politics have proven to be the most successful weapon in our black_power arsenal and its impact has been greatest on the local level black people are concentrated in the urban areas thus it has been in the city governments that black people have come closest to achieving the ideal of a pluralist societyproportional representation in the centers of power for example black people represent about per cent of the united states population but only per cent of the federal con gressmen are black yet if we examine a local level such as in cleveland ohio we find that black people comprise about per cent of the citys population and hold onethird of the city council seats thus on the federal level our power is more or less symbolic but on many local levels black political power is real and significanteven if not always decisive conditions of the times dictate that we must move from strength to success to do this we must accelerate the development of the local or grass roots base of our political power local governments in nearly all cases create control and administer school systems zoning and housing codes welfare programs refuse collection and many other daytoday government services local governments ultimately determine where new streets will be built or not built where housing codes are enforced or not enforced police policies and the nature of the local tax base these matters play a major role in the lives and development of communities even when programs originate on the federal or state level they are usually administered in the local level many of the problems which plague black communities can be traced to the decisions and policies of local government these range from overcrowded schools and housing to zoning decisions that can quickly undermine black property values deteriorate black neighborhoods and create slums black political power applied to the local government level is obviously one of the means by which black communities can attack problems and protect their interests and pluralistic black nationalism is an ideology to make the connection between often obscure government decisions and the wellbeing of black communities unfortunately the importance of local politics and local government is sometimes overlooked black politicians are almost universal in noting that while the situation is improving black political organizations still suffer from a lack of yearround community participation funds organizers and candidates who are willing to run for officeparticularly local office the qualified people exist but the importance of local organization and of capturing local offices is too often not fully appreciated and as a political leader in houston texas observed black people vote the right way when they vote the point is that effective political organization requires much more than registering voters once registered black voters need information and insight into the subtleties of the issues many of the vitally important issues which have consequences for a community can easily escape the notice of the lay man if these issues are not brought to his attention and explained this is not only a question of having the leaders who are alert to the issues it is also a question of having the channels of communication for disseminating the information and this is a function of effective organization we have achieved some successes through politics but in the light of the problems that still face us despite these successes we must continue to develop our political potential and forge it into effective organizations and to do this we must have a reference frame from which we can recognize consider and evaluate the issues and decisions which influence our lives and we must have a comprehensive program for action pluralistic black nationalism meets both of these needs pluralistic black nationalism and retail ecoiqmic develop ment in the field of economic development pluralistic black nationalism is a particularly useful approach to channeling black consciousness into institutional structures for as we noted above the powerlessness of black people is relative not absolute just as we carry political ballots that are significant so too we carry potentially effective economic ballots in the form of our consumption and investment dollars in terms of developing black communities how and where a black man spends his dollars are just as important as how he votes for by investing our consumer and investment capital in our own communities we can generate additional resources reduce unemployment and increase our selfsufficiency and freedom as long as we are a part of this society we should be full members of its economic common market along with the other nationality groups and we should enjoy the mutual benefits of our common membership yet black communities resemble still developing countries with balanceoftrade problems too much of our communities resources flow outward this trend must be reversed and it can be we can cast our consumer and investment ballots for our own communities perhaps we are not yet in the position to become large scale producers of goods but still we can own manage and control the retail outlets in our communities we can trade for the goods and services that we cannot produce for ourselves neither are black people penniless for indeed there is gold in the black valleysnot to mention the hills the dollars we all spend for food shelter clothing drugs gasoline etc are the dollars that can support black retail outlets and not only are there consumer dollars in the back community there are surplus dollars as well that can be wooed into capital investment to build the retail facilities the task at hand is to provide competitive and attractive consumer outlets and investment opportunities for these dollars but the age of the small individual entrepreneur is passing today economic institutions are large and corporately owned rather than attempt to develop small and marginal shops black people must and have done so create corporations on a larger and more efficient scale the attractiveness of retail development stems from the fact that many of the jobs created by it can utilize unskilled labor and thus draw upon the vast reservoir of the black unemployed retail jobs even up to the management level do not necessarily require extensive formal educations these jobs require literacy diligence and skills that can either be learned onthejob or after a short training period most black people are literate almost all are used to hard work and enough are nationally conscious of the extent that they will go out of their way to support a black business community if given good and fair service and attractive investment opportunities it is not enough to depend upon jobs in institutions industries and businesses controlled by those who live outside the black community this is not to argue that black people should not have jobs outside the black community but rather to recognize that there are not enough of them forthcoming we are all familiar with black unemployment figures and we have seen the reports which show that the average black man with some years of college education earns less than the average white man with an eighthgrade education surely part of this discrepancy stems from the fact that even after black people achieve formal educations they still suffer at the hands of white employers many black people have educations but we have failed to create enough institutions to provide us with job opportunities untouched by racism it is no accident that with the exception of entertainers the groups of black people who have done best economically are those professionals and businessmen who draw their incomes from black clients and customers it is not then enough for black people to be employees we must also be owners capital plus labor equals profit or surplus capital for the owners of the capital when this surplus capital flows out of a community stagnation results black communities will develop only as surplus capital is channeled back into them another advantage of retail development is that it is in keeping with the trends of the overall economy automation and technological advances are decreasing the relative numbers of production workers needed while at the same time raising the required educational level the big job demands of the future can be expected in the service and white collar industries which include the retail sector and in the construction trades retail development creates a demand for construction and jobs such as managers sales people service men etc and at the same time creates new clients and customers for black professionals businessmen and financial institutions most important black retail development would generate additional resources and rechannel them back into the community to stimulate further growth retail outlets are dependent upon production but the actual situation is one of mutual dependency or interdependency for as much as the retail outlets need the products of the production centers the production centers in turn need retail outlets to distribute their products an argument can even be made that the retail or consumption sector is somewhat more important in a surplus economy such as ours united states industries operate below capacity they can produce more than they can sell this means that it is usually in the interests of the producers to find new and broader retail outlets at any rate to concentrate on retail development is not to become hopelessly dependent upon producers if black people are watchful and well organized we can protect our interests maintain our independence and control our economic communities through selective buying and if need be boycotts this society is becoming increasingly conservative we black people must move on our own if we are to advance our relative position and improve our lives although some believe contrariwise it has yet to be proven that we cannot achieve our goals even within the framework of this far from perfect society if the day comes when other groups seek to openly block our advancement then we should man the barricades until that day comes we should continue to develop our potentialfor the surface has only been scratched in any event we must indeed keep the faith in ourselves in each other and in our groups capability and improvability black nationalism has been with us a long time and it is applicable to our present and future needs the point of view expressed here purports to be neither absolute nor final but it is hoped that pluralistic black nationalism will henceforth be at least one of the great debates back in feudal times when the lowly vassal was assigned some land his lord to make sure the underling got the message of how beholden he was required the poor guy to crouch stark naked fold his hands as though praying and intone the humble vassals oath while landlords have been obliged to scratch this requirement they have jealously kept intact other lordly rights in defiance of twentieth century tenancy reality feudal custom is firmly entrenched in todays landlordtenant law especially court opinion which is the chief formulator of tenancys powers and obligations many legal experts say this centuriesold hangup is the reason slums persistently stay with us undaunted by the frenzy of renewal and code enforcement and purported tenantrelief statutes they say further that this is why rent strikes have failed to bring relief except in new york city where a unique statute permits rent withholding under certain circumstances when a rent strike reaches the court stage the judge virtually always sides with the landlord tenant abuse persists according to this view because the rental housing consumerunlike all other modem consumersis not granted power to demand his due a group of talented lawyers across the country are making a concerted effort to remould tenantshackling court opinion and one of the most vigorous is james jim herndon a young negro lawyer who practices in san francisco herndons remoulding tools are wellprepared court cases for his thrust against entrenched injustice he seeks out instances of tenant abuse that while condoned by existing court opinion are nonetheless so manifestly wrong that a judge might be moved to agree herndon will travel anywhere in california to fight a good test case the courts have got to change says the lawyer judges still see renting as a conveyance like back in feudal times when lords assigned lands to their vassals for or years since vassals were basically sharecroppers the landlord had absolute right to the rent it represented a share of what issued from the land if rent wasnt paid the lords agents galloped in and took it naturally it was up to the vassal to maintain the place he mended the fieldstone walls and kept up the roads when the gale carried off the roof he rethatched but todays tenant isnt sharecropping his rent issues from his pocketbook and what he bargains for and pays for is habitable living quarters facilities and services all three yet he is forced to pay the full rent even if he gets just one of these purchasesthe space herndon points out that there is no defense for nonpayment of rent summary eviction proceedings dont permit so much as a mention of a landlords default only the tenants even if an apartment were flooded or roofless or firegutted if the tenant remains on the premises he has to pay the full rent says herndon all other purchasers of a deficient productsay a car with a defective transmission can demand restitution if you order a supply of liquor and get half empty boxes you dont have to pay for the empties do you judicial bias emasculates purported tenant relief statutes herndon claims several states have authorized the tenant to spend up to a months rent in some states two to make vital repairs if the landlord wont not only is the rent money insufficient to cover most vital repairs but worse the statutes fail to define what is vital the tenant who dares spend the rent for repairs finds himself in trouble if there is no lease the landlord retaliates by evicting the tenant if a lease exists the landlord goes to court and challenges the expenditure as unnecessary and judges generally side with landlords on this point it goes likewise with the principle of constructive eviction which courts recognize in theory but rarely in practice supposedly the tenant is free to break his lease and move if the premises become uninhabitable but the wise tenant knows better just what uninhabitable means no court has decided for certain the tenant who thinks he knows and accordingly moves finds himself hailed before a judge who by habit agrees with the land lord that the tenant was overfinicky as for housing code violations when a landlord is taken to court for a citation the judge lets him off with a few dollars fine or accepts his work permit as proof that hell correct the violation off the hook the landlord usually forgets about repairing theres a simple reason in herndons view why the landlordtenant transaction remains feudal tenants havent pled their case whereas landlords keep a legion of lawyers arguing in court to see that the law gets interpreted in their favor and the feudal way favors them those who use the law mould the law things wont change until tenants swing equal weight in court theyve got to seize the initiative aggressively defend themselves appeal landlord victories to higher courts initiate cases against landlords and fight hard to win only through this route will the rental contract become reciprocal herndon a slight handsome bachelor is a nighttime stealerinandout of drab tenant gatherings in drab settingsclusters of tiredlooking men and women under a naked light bulb in a housing project apartment or in the stark sunday school room of a slum church as familiar as his favorite jazz records are complaints of doors that wont lock toilets that wont flush drains that wont drain sometimes told in anger sometimes in tears while seeming to study his wellpolished shoes he listens for two types of situations first he detects pitfalls a tenant may be approachingsome trap that would propel him into a damage suit or even into jail while the landlord knows tenant law like the back of his hand tenant law to the average tenant is as tricky as a mine field yet slum tenants often make the leap from hopelessness to a heady assumption that because they have found company in their misery they can spit in the landlords eye to herndon falls the thankless task of throwing cold legal reality upon righteous indignation at one meeting anger was fizzing like a bicarbonate of soda a gaunt janitress whose earnings supported five children and a bedridden mother had just recounted how for months she had urged her landlord to repair a plumbing leak that soaked a wall of her mothers room after the mother became ill with pneumonia she decided to borrow with which she had the leak repaired and purchased materials for plastering and papering the wall herself instead of thanks she got a rent increase the landlord refused to accept the old rent she refused to pay more and now she was facing eviction the womans eyes snapped i pay my own way ill never take welfare but my pay wont stretch no further im not beat though when they come to evict us ill bar them with a shotgun my mother shouldnt be moved during this rainy season and shes not going to be herndon admired the womans spunk but he had to inform her that illness no matter how serious wouldnt stop a courtordered eviction and anyhow her mother could stand being moved in the rain better than seeing her daughter taken to jail but its robbery the woman cried im still paying off my repair loan shes right several voices chorused rip out that new plaster and wallpaper someone suggested all installations and improvements belong to the landlord herndon said with a sigh for the womans protection he persuaded her to submit but he felt angry at his profession which as propertys hireling had caused her desperation and he was angry at his helplessness to rescue her but sometimes there is a way one housing project council herndon advises staged a sitin to halt what it felt was an unfair eviction of a project family herndon theorized correctly that the city would not use force to remove sympathetic neighbors when the eviction crew arrived other project families literally packed the apartment sprawling over every bed every table the eviction crew left emptyhanded the same council successfully employed another unconventional protest method after the housing authority had refused to let them express grievances at an authority meeting the tenants barred exits at the end of the meeting and held board members captive for two startled hours forcing them to listen the tenants won several concessions but always herndon is listening for the makings of a good test case an instance of abuse that has a chance of winning relief in court such a victory is a wedgea precedent on which to build other cases he says unions and racial minorities have won significant rights through test cases that molded the law their way herndon hopes one day to persuade a judge to recognize that a rental agreement is a simple contract between buyer and seller for the use of space facilities and services the judge who admits this basic point herndon reasons would be obliged to admit the buyer need not pay for what he doesnt get the tenant who received only part of his purchase could demand restitution either a pro rata reduction of his rent or permission to withhold rent until he gets all he bargained for one of herndons most successful tenant cases occurred not in san francisco but in californias fruitgrowing region he acted as counsel for a rent strike in tulare county where migratoryworker families had struck to protest rent increases on dwellings they rented from the county the hikes werent muchfrom to but neither were the quarters by foot floorless corrugated sheds without facilities the federal government had given the camp to the county which had accumulated a surplus on it the rent strike was six months old when the county sued to evict the families herndon based his defense on evidence that if tenants paid for the sheds they would not be getting value received and also on a regulation which stated that raising rents required a new lease the judge quashed the eviction though leaning solely on the lease regulation in his opinion herndons insistence that any random day in court would bear out his appraisal of the judicial bias on tenancy led this reporter to drop by the san francisco small claims court one morning without checking the docket it was friday a light court day and in the court section i visited only one landlordtenant case was scheduled in the sunny golden oak courtroom quietly waited an uneasy commingling of the prosperous and the poor small claims courts were designed to permit those who cant afford lawyers to seek redress on small matters aggrieved persons may sue without counsel for judgments up to in reality the poor rarely initiate cases the courts serve primarily as inexpensive collection machinery for merchants and landlords i listened to a succession of cases in which plaintiffs sought to collect owed bills and make good on bad checks but there was one customerinitiated case a comely matron successfully sued to recover for her unhappy purchase of a defective wig from her hairdresser then a bailiffs call brought before the judge a stylish blond an american indian and his slight wife who carried an infant and coaxed alongside three other small children the blond woman told the court that the family owed her a months rentthey had moved without giving the months notice or equivalent payment that california law says the tenant must m give the landlord before vacating they also owed for a broken window is this what happened the judge asked the couple in the informal manner of small claims proceedings yes the indian answered but we had reason he identified himself as an american seaman he said he had been flown home from the philippines for tuberculosis treatment to find his family without heat the bedroom ceiling leaking rain and the bathroom floor covered with water from a plumbing leak i moved the wife and kids onto dry land he said tersely the wife took up the thread in a weak voice she had repeatedly asked for repairs she said finally had called the health department a man had come out inspected and served the landlord an order to repair but no repairman came the children kept slipping down in the water and getting their clothes wet and the house was cold although brief the testimony touched on several points of law besides the requirement that tenants give a months notice both state and municipal statutes require the provision of heat and declare leaking roofs and leaking plumbing to constitute housing code violations then there is a court rule which theoretically permits tenants to move without obligation if the premises become uninhabitable the judges decision however was for the landlord the tenant was ordered to pay a months rent and the window assessment plus the court costs in higher courts the tenant finds himself even more handicapped herndon says in addition to judicial bias he and his neighborhood lawyer find themselves up against highlypaid council often a specialist in property cases these skilled men carefully plan their defenses to ward off court decisions unfavorable to landlordsdecisions that would set unwanted precedents it is against these affluent forces that herndon and his fellow crusaders have pitted themselves usually on a nonfee basis in the meantime until herndon and others persuade the courts to face modem tenant reality you may well find yourself in other positions even more uncomfortable the movement of black intellectuals toward total rejection of white control over the interpretation and evaluation of the forces and influences which shape black lives is inevitably sweeping some fellowtraveling black writers and leaders out of the way in the process it appears that ralph ellison surely one of the most gifted of american writers is rapidly losing his luster among black intellectuals even as he gains in glitter in the white establishment in a review of the book images of the negro in american literature published recently in freedomways ernest kaiser of the schomburg collection made the following very pertinent and perceptive assessment of the controversial mr ellison to ellison negro life in america is merely a part of the general human condition of western man to be mastered individually by each negro as a man he doesnt like the sociological description of the negroes struggles and suffering in the ghetto for he thinks that the sociological account reduces the negro and denies his humanity and cultural heritage but he is mistaken here the two go together they are not mutually exclusive at all following andre malraux the existentialists the disillusioned or clever opportunistic attackers of the left and the new critics who emphasize form as supreme even determining content ellison has become an establishment writer an uncle tom an attacker of the sociological formulations of the civil_rights movement a defender of the criminal vietnam war of extermination against the asian and american negro people a denigrator of the great tradition of negro protest writing and worst of all for himself as a creative artist a writer of weak and ineffectual fiction and essays mostly about himself and how he became an artist see the chapter from his forthcoming novel it always breaks out partisan review spring several pieces in shadow and act tell it like it is baby the nation september and the interviews of him an american novelist who sometimes teaches n y times magazine nov and a very stern discipline harpers march and ironically enough ellison has developed in this way and reached these conclusions at the very time when the negro peoples liberation struggle has reached new heights when writers like john o killens the late lorraine hansberry langston hughes ronald l fair margaret walker william melvin kelley james baldwin paule marshall ossie davis loften mitchell lerone bennett jr john henrik clarke and other negro writers have delineated in novels short stories plays and trenchant essays the negro peoples aspirations and heroic struggles every little bit helps the saying goes and it sometimes is amazing how much a very little can do take trading stamps for example they come as a bonus for buying food or furniture or gasoline or clothing and one can easily do without them in any event the individual collector must wait a very long time before the stamps can be traded for anything of substantial value on the other hand if a great many collectors send their small supply of stamps to a single collector then something of substantial value can be obtained well a branch of the students nonviolent coordinating committee is collecting trading stamps from donors all over the country to help the civil_rights organization equip offices and keep autos functioning says the chairman of the sncc stamp drive over the past couple of years we have been able to exchange the stamps for a great deal of the equipment which keeps our cars operational for our field workers among the things which we have acquired are electrical tirechanging apparatus several battery chargers analyzing machines an air meter a voltage regulator machine a wheel balancer and three falcon econoline buses this has been of invaluable service to us and our work all trading stamps are welcome however the preferred ones are the following s h green blue chip top value holden red and gold bond send the stamps to the title of arna bontemps and jack conroys book anyplace but here hill and wang is the punchline of a joke about some negro hoboes during the depression who flee a spot infested by a tough railroad detective the expression could equally well be attributed to the white denizens of cities to which negroes have migrated as the book is a record of the hardships and rejections negroes have suffered in their search for a better home anyplace but here is a reworking and a bringing up to date of they seek a city published in chapters are added on the watts chicago and harlem riots bringing events up to and the earlier chapters are rewritten parallel to the westward migration of the whites which negroes participated in as slaves scouts trappers cowboys cavalrymen and prospectors was the mass northward migration of negroes after the civil war the book tells of benjamin pap singleton who instigated the migration of negroes to kansas from the south after reconstruction singleton distributed circulars and chromos depicting prosperous conditions in kansas many negroes emigrated to kansas while others stopped in indiana and illinois or went farther west to colorado and california the book sketches the careers of many negroes of achievement among them jean baptiste point du sable founder of chicago jim beckwourth hunter trapper and scout william still a conductor in the underground railroad harriet tubman john jones prominent businessman and abolitionist of chicago the book documents the migration of negroes to chicago st louis detroit and new york during and after world war i and northward and westward after world war ii wherever negroes migrated they met opposition there were race riots in east st louis washington d c detroit chicago and other cities yet the negro has to assert his right to move and live freely wherever he desires even though it may involve living next to some very unpleasant neighbors by asserting his own rights he assures these rights to all i noticed two slight errors in the section about detroit which should be corrected in subsequent printings the street to which dr ossian sweet of the famous sweet case moved was not griswold but garland street griswold is a business street in downtown detroit belle isle park where the race riot of began is not a park on belle isle belle isle park is belle isledudley randall keep the faith baby is a book of sermons by the rev adam clayton powell published by trident press at the creativity of a clergyman is displayed in his sermon efforts the mark of authentic art is whether it clearly communicates the significant issues emerging from the contemporary scene unfortunately not many clergy have met this challenge however this is not the case with adam clayton powell this book of sermons spans his years as pastor of abyssinian baptist church they show that he is a watchman to his people in that he not only faithfully presents the hope of the christian faith but he does so by courageously couching this message within emerging issues of his time for this he is peculiarly well equipped since he is in the congress of this country he was aware of the world issues as they were emerging and to this information he creatively wove the significance of the hopes and aspirations of the black man in doing this he uniquely challenged the integrity of the united states as well as the courage of his constituents there is a timelessness about his sermons in that many of them speak to specific issues and yet they speak to the ongoing struggles of men everywhere for equality and justice he focuses the insights of the christian holy scriptures on the contemporary scene in the same way that an expert spotlight man does on the stage he believes that generalized preaching is nonbiblical and cites for his authority jesus who used specific parables as his main source of confrontation and teaching the upshot of this important work is that it symbolizes this inescapable fact which not enough people have realized that the saving element that can heal this society is the black man the black man for many reasons such as his perspective his sensitivity and circumstances is in the peculiar position to perform this important service for this culture as well as the world a quote from page bears this out what can the negro do to develop this civilization anew unless the american blacks can supply something that the sweep of the white mans civilization has omitted there can be no future world certainly no better world this the negro cannot supply until he refuses to drink any more of the poisons of this civilization adam clayton powell in this book claims to be the author of the phrase black_power he tells what he means by the phrase first of all black_power is not antiwhite black_power incorporates everybody who wishes to work together vote together and worship together is black_power white supremacy in reverse black_power makes no moral judgment but white supremacy does black_power simply reaffirms the integrity dignity and selfrespect of black people white supremacy denies them if white people can accept black leadership then i adam clayton powell welcome them this work provides an opportunity for many who have not observed the pastoral side of adam clayton powell to share his courageous and clear insights it is no wonder that many white clergymen now want to pastor black congregations for they realize that the true and challenging movements of god in our society are most clearly at work in the communities of the persecuted and oppressed though many folk doubt it we once had a childhood and we even wore plaits until people told us yearolds should

white man deserves to be complimented in that he has observed the negro carefully and reproduced the feelings of black people rather significantly the rev mr borders has the kind of wisdom that we can all learn from and this book is a minimum tribute to such a significant lifejames e woodruff jack olsen has written a book about cassius clay whom the world is begrudgingly beginning to recognize as muhammad ali black is best putnam is based on a fivepart profile of the world heavyweight boxing champion written for sports illustrated of which the author is senior editor it is in comparison with the treatment generally accorded to its subject by the press a generous and objective picture of an entertaining serious and contradictory man although not an authorized biography and a distinctly unfriendly one as far as alis muslim beliefs are concerned the champion simultaneously withheld his approval and promoted the book in much the same way as he can taunt and goad his opponents and exhibit a tender solicitude for their healthafter the fight clearly ali is something unprecedented in the sporting life he has rejected most of the stereotyped activities associated with champion status for a negro fighterhe doesnt drink smoke or chase white women he is in his own eccentric way articulate and his own publicist he has no obvious vices but he is immodest about his own excellence and is a muslim mr olsen is tolerant of the former but not the latter and undoubtedly feels that his muslim entourage increasingly removes him from reality and exploits his fame and his pocket with these prejudices which will certainly be shared by many of his readers mr olsen has nevertheless given us a reasonably full account of alis childhood of his parents and other relatives cassius clay sr might merit a book himself his coaches trainers and physicians and his brief marriage alis determination to be accessible to his people to the slum children who surround him in miami new york and chicago is a consistent and endearing factor among the many that make up his kaleidoscopic personality more attention indeed is devoted to alis personality than to his career as a fighter though an appendix lists opinions of various authorities fight promoters journalists other fighters of his standing in the ranks of championship holders he emerges as narcissistic ingenuous but shrewd mystical but practical given to wild flights of imagination and moments of sober truth but certainly neither charlatan nor fool brenda m biram i the race war the viking press by ronald segal is a book that every american should read although white ronald segal has surveyed history from the perspective of a nonwhite his thesis is that the world is divided into two groups those who have and those who have not it is apparent that those with the economic advantage are white and those without it are nonwhite in its frenzy to keep its highly profitable economic advantage throughout the world the west has taken a stand against any and all revolutions that promise to liberate the poor from the oppression of poverty the united states leads the west in spreading and defending the democracy of privilege as a result the united states threatens to weld the forces of race and desperate poverty into one mr segals survey of history explodes many of our humanitarian and democratic myths often the united states has used these myths to justify its foreign policy and international involvements mr segal reveals the united states as something much less than the white knighthenceforth an expensive and dangerous deceit in about a hundred pages mr segal strides through years of african history naturally much is omitted yet much more is said about subsahara history than is usually found in histories dealing with this oftenblack world the ancient kingdoms of kush ghana mali and songhai were not pocket kingdoms they covered vast areas included considerable populations and depended upon a complex administration yes africa has had a grand splendid history mr segals analysis of todays africa should be read by every western diplomat and molder of governmental policy he observes that the truth is that it is not neutralism or socialism that the west distrusts as much as independence mr segal sees south america as another continent ready to erupt into revolution he concludes that any country where the majority of the people are poor and starving is ripe for revolution and in south america the small ruling class is white the havenots are nonwhite in too many places in the world oppression and indifference to poverty and suffering have become identified with whites mr segals history of south america and his analysis of south americas present economic and social ills lead to the conclusion that the small ruling class in these countries to the south have already done much to unite the pain of poverty with color mr segals criticisms of the united states and russia find both countries guilty of racism and fated to be in opposition to future revolutions which may upset the existing racial and economic power structure regarding britain it is inconceivable that a nation that has spent over years dominating colored people bouncing in and out of foreign lands and exacting tribute at whim would restrict the flow of colored people to her shores she has though and britains handling of southern rhodesia has not been lost on the african world russias treatment of african students studying within her boundaries has not endeared them to her explanations other than race have been given for this sometimes brutal treatment only time will tell whether this virulent madness has taken root in russia too the united states history of racism and brutality is carefully surveyed little needs to be said on this score we are familiar with the role our country has played and is still playing in the whiteblack showdown on the other hand china has several advantages over the west she is a colored nation she has risen and will continue to rise from backward circumstances similar to many emerging nations and she has been ruthlessly exploited by the west britain forced opium on china in as a medium of trade china fought to preserve her dignity and integrity she lost the opium war she also lost the boxer rebellion at the beginning of the twentieth century as a consequence she was economically and territorially ravished by britain and the united states russia has been slow to respond to the need of the chinese communists she has given them little support china represents to the colored world a hope and a way to independence more importantly chinas victory over the west regardless of the area gives the colored nations a boost in morale for here is a colored nation giving the whites what so many feel is their just due again every american should read this book whether you accept mr segals premise does not matter you however will be brought face to face with vital issues which may decide your fate you will be exposed to these issues from a nonwhite perspective this point of view may be of crucial importance to all of us to your surprise you will find many feelings and suspicions raised to a conscious historical level that alone is enough to make this book worthwhileronald williams the reader of john beechers to live and die in dixie red mountain editions is surprised to see poems like in egypt land coming from a white writer in alabama but the surprise vanishes when he reads commemoration ode and learns that the poet is the greatgrandnephew of henry ward beecher and harriet beecher stowe in egypt land is a long narrative poem about sharecroppers trying to organize its looserhythmed unrimed lines and plain vocabulary studded with the homely phrases of the negro characters hold the interest like a good short story in the section to live and die in dixie there are poems about race relations written from the point of view of whites our gang laid for the kids from niggertown wed whoop from ambush chunking flints and see pale soles of black feet scampering more fun than birds to chunk at birds were too hard to hit in the section bestride the narrow world which extends the horizons he has the same deadpan matteroffactness in a veterans day of recollection he says wed liberated naples and the wops had come aboard to work cargo this starving spik slipped a can of rations underneath his lousy rags we drilled him john beecher is classical in his simple directness there are no ornament no tricks his power depends on the force of what he has to say and the arrangement and interrelationships of the parts there is danger of flatness and sometimes of turgidity in this way of writing but at his best he is plain and powerful hearing no protests and seeing no pickets j yale university press v has published a paperback revised edition of robert a bones the negro novel in america now too late to prevent publication but perhaps in time to caution readers avidly seeking to learn about the artistic contributions of negroes it is necessary to point out the shortcomings the fallacies and the biases which vitiate mr bones commendable effort to evaluate negro writers novels according to literary criteria although i must become caustic i write with regret for such a book is needed and mr bone frequently demonstrates both the requisite critical acuteness and the literary talent to write perceptively and engagingly unfortunately not content to confine himself to the role of critic and historian of individual writers he has presumed to serve as psychiatrist philosopher and teacher not only for all negro writers but for all negroes forgetting his own admonition that extraordinary experience with another race is required of a writer who wishes to write perceptively of that race p he has set forth a creed for the negro writer and intellectual and he has defended that creed by errors of fact and inference inconsistencies and contradictions supercilious lectures and flippant remarks often in bad taste the characteristic weaknesses appear in the first two paragraphs of the introduction the advocates of naive brotherhood will object in advance to the notion of a negro novel they will deny usually without having read them that novels written by american negroes differ significantly from novels written by other americans to this line of argument the classic rebuttal has been advanced by j saunders redding season it as you will he writes the thought that the negro american is different from other americans is still unpalatable to most negroes nevertheless he continues the negro is different an iron ring of historical circumstance has made him so as if to restore the balance he adds but the difference is of little depth with this balanced view i agree it is a serious mistake to gloss over or ignore strong cultural differences in order to speed the process of integration pp bone covers an amazing amount of ground he intends to persuade the advocates of naive brotherhood that a negro novel exists first therefore his audience becomes indefinite i know what is meant by the phrase naive advocates of brotherhood but i do not know what is meant by naive brotherhood second bone seems determined to tilt with don quixotes giants few if any people question the fact that negro novels have been written the more critical issue is whether all novels written by american negroes differ significantly from novels written by other americans in such a way that a reader can determine the difference the impossibility of ever proving this statement is easily evidenced by the mistakes which have been made in identifying the racial origins of nonnegroes who have written about white people readers ignorant of the race of henrietta buckmaster or frank yerby do not instinctively recognize the truth but bone wanted to prove that there is a significant difference and in the age of madison avenue advertising he chose to prove it by testimony from one who should knowa negro writer bones misuse of saunders reddings words should provide teachers of freshman composition with at least one lecture on propaganda devices redding says that most negroes do not like to think that they are different from other americans but because of historical circumstances they have a difference which is of little depth to bone this proves strong cultural differences which produce a readily identifiable negro novel even this triumph is not enough for bone who jumps from a literary question not solved to a social question not asked as he advises the reader not to ignore the strong differences in order to speed the process of integration the literary critic has become the social teacher these two paragraphs are a microcosm of the work the remainder of the introduction is similarly marred the dominant thesis is that as a minority group stripped denuded is bones word of its native culture the negro in america has been sundered in a psychic tugofwar between assimilationism and negro nationalism wishing to be white he has repulsed lowerclass members of his race while he has aped the mannerisms of middleclass white people cognizant that he is restricted within the dominant culture he has militantly marshaled his hatred against the white majority while he has aggrandized the minor successes of his own race assimilationism and negro nationalism concepts indispensable to understanding the cultural history of the american negro are employed throughout the work not only in interpreting the consciousness of individual authors but in gauging the temper of whole periods they provide a fixed point of reference from which to view the changing attitudes of the negro novelistattitudes which are often fundamental to the content of his art p this framework he says will provide analytical tools for studying the cultural history of the ethnic minority the american negro historians like benjamin quarles would argue that mr bones onesentence stripping of african culture from the american negro is a dubious oversimplification by failing to adopt a similar framework for analyzing the work of writers of the irish renaissance or jewish writers in america literary historians seem to distrust bones approach the major objection however is bones continuing to quote such respected writers as redding wright and ellison to verify conclusions which would be accepted without argument by a negro at least while he postulates as incontrovertible other theories which he has established by dexterous implication fallacious inference and wit for instance i would not dispute that if one wishes to simplify one may study the history of any minority groupfrom the hebrews in an egyptian society to the presentin terms of the attempt of that group to become part of or to rebel against the dominant culture but that fact does not justify the implication that a negro is hypocritical or assimilationistic if he likes beethovens music attends a staid episcopalian rather than a shouting baptist church and develops a patriarchal family structure p the implication itself reveals the essential weakness in mr bones thought having a preconceived image of the negro and of the lives of negroes he defends those writers who support his image and attacks those who create contrary images although he admonishes scholars who attempt to base literary judgments on social bases p too soon he lies in the pit against which he warned it is tempting but impossible in a paper of this length to refute mr bone point by point to call attention to all the errors of fact for many of which i would excuse him knowing the difficulty of dredging out some of the information to cite the many fallacious and inexcusable inferences and to note the instances in which the zest for turning a phrase has created a breach of good taste for the sake of illustration however i must discuss some of the more glaring the work is structured in six parts part i the novel of the rising middle class part ii the discovery of the folk part iii the search for a tradition part iv the revolt against protest a postscript an essay on james baldwin which constitutes the only new material in the revised edition and an epilogue advice to negro writers parts iii and iv and the postscript have value as has the bibliography the book would be better if the other sections had not been written the poorest of the historiliterary sections is part i aggrieved by what he believes to be deplorable assimilationism by the negro middleclass and contemptuous of the popular literary traditions before bone devotes considerable verbiage to an attack on both but principally the middleclass he begins his attack with a spurious history of the rise of the middleclass the historical origins of the negro middleclass can be traced back to the nocturnal escapades of countless male aristocrats who tried valiantly to wash a race whiter than snow p less offensive than the tasteless facetiousness is the amusing fact that despite his contempt for the negro writers who echoed the plantation tradition bone himself accepted one of the cardinal myths by implying that the south was populated only by aristocrats ignoring such darkskinned house servants as paul laurence dunbars mother he continues his myth by asserting that the house servants were mulatto children of the master who after the civil war naturally turned for assistance to the southern democrats who were their kin therefore they wrote novels addressed to their white folks reluctant to abandon the benefits of paternalism they still hoped to solve the problem of the color line within the family both branches p since bone is vague about the identity of the early novelists it is difficult to refute him specifically one mentioned in the chapter however is charles w chesnutt who certainly did not believe that he was addressing his novels to his white kinfolk the middleclass next appears bone states under the guise of the talented tenth a term which is the italics are bones used synonymously with negro middleclass p bones ambiguous phrasing makes it impossible to determine whether he is explaining that he wilfully uses it as a synonym or whether he mistakenly assumed that w e b du bois considered it a synonym needless to say du bois had too keen a sense of figures to have any difficulty distinguishing between the upper intellectual tenth of any group and the middle socioeconomic section of that same group for bone however talented tenth equals middleclass equals assimilationist bone reprimands this talented tenth group of early novelists one must assume that he includes all novelists before for adopting the horatio alger success formula and for attempting to inculcate middleclass morality into their readers he concludes his reprimand with the dramatically irrelevant allegation that the early negro novelist had the soul of a shopkeeper p a note reminiscent of some diatribes about the butcher boy of stratford this is not bones only grievance against the early novelists assuming that we are inclined to assume that this early protest literature was based on a catholic concern for the brotherhood of man p an assumption never made by a negro literary historian he hastens to point out that the early novelists were prejudiced against jews immigrants and nonwhites p even worse they sometimes betrayed their own race as when chesnutts protagonist protested his unwillingness to sit beside a group of negro farm hands here bone repeats the moral judgment uttered by liberals and by negroes themselves the negro should not be a snob any member of another group may despise the less talented less strong less intelligent less wealthy less healthy members of his group but the negro must love his fellowman worst of all bone continues the desire to assimilate caused the talented tenth to imitate outworn literary traditions of romanticism and melodrama rather than to recognize that american literature of the future would be that emulating the realism and naturalism and the styles of twain garland howells dreiser norris and james this is certainly the only instance in which a literary historian has found in social aspirations an explanation of the literary style of not one but an entire group of writers harassed by bones allegations and inconsistencies the early negro novelist has no chance for respectability if like chesnutt he realistically expressed the attitudes of negroes he is chastized for lacking a brotherly spirit if he wrote a horatio alger story he is derided as an assimilationist the obvious implication is that success stories should have been written only by white authors for white readers for the negro should never have expected such success but that is exactly the attitude stated in one mans fortune by paul laurence dunbar whom bone denounces as an archassimilationist if the early novelist wrote in the melodramatic tradition of his time he is castigated for lacking the perceptivity missing equally from hundreds of nonnegro novelists who were writing the same kind of melodrama in the second chapter bone finally identifies the talented tenth novelists and a motley group they are whereas bone distinguished the writing of twain from that of howells and henry james he gathers into a single group the following diverse personalities paul laurence dunbar a provincial high school educated ohioborn and reared darkskinned youth who distrusted mulattoes and considered prose inferior to poetry charles waddell chesnutt a talented shortstory writer born in ohio but reared in north carolina sensitive to the problems of lightcolored negroes outspoken and determined to carve his fortune w e b du bois of massachusetts aristocratically proud of his ancestry educated as a scholar arrogant and militant a talented essayist who sometimes collected his essays as history and sometimes as novels and james weldon johnson cosmopolite from florida trained in education and in law attuned to the theatrical world of new york and to the diplomatic world of washington never has there been such a bundling under a single blanket since the bees flew in with aunt matilda to enforce the nonexistent unity bone digs out surprising similarities chesnutt and dunbar both wrote their first stories in the plantation tradition in the case of chesnutt this refers to the fact that his first published collection of tales focused on uncle julius a shrewd southern negro who to advance his own ends tells his northern employer tales based on the folk superstitions of negroes in north carolina unlike the typical stories of the plantation tradition they do not glorify the antebellum south as bone knew or should have known chesnutt once protested that he would not write about negroes contented with peonage under their exmasters even though he knew such negroes existed to identify chesnutt with the plantation tradition is therefore akin to describing guy de maupassant as a pastoral writer because he wrote about rural people furthermore bone asserts chesnutt and dunbar had white literary patronswalter hines page and william dean howells respectively the term patron insults all four men for it implies support far beyond that given or received page it is true was the first editor to accept chesnutts stories but the decision to publish the first collection of chesnutts stories and his novels required authority which page lacked the relationship of howells to dunbar is even more tenuous howells introduced the poetry of dunbar to national attention by writing a favorable review of majors and minors and by writing an introduction to lyrics of lowly life if these acts define a patron then baudelaire was a patron of edgar allan poe actually dunbar unlike chesnutt did have white patrons but they were far less eminent than howells injudicious appraisals mar the attention which bone gives to these writers as individuals although he magnanimously contends that extenuating circumstances motivated dunbars uncle tom behavior he writes whenever dunbar had something to say which transcended the boundaries of the plantation tradition he resorted to the subterfuge of employing white characters rather than attempting a serious literary portrait of the negro p obviously mr bone failed to read the strength of gideon and other stories bone sees in the relationship of bles and zora in the silver fleece du boiss unconscious allegory of his attempt to embrace the negro masses an action which he can undertake only if zora re deems herself it is scarcely necessary to point out that in american novels of one rarely finds heroes being wed to unredeemed or even to slightly stained heroines were all these writers revealing their unconscious antipathy for the masses or is such biographical symbolism to be exercised only in reading novels written by negroes bone describes du boiss diction as a schizophrenic clash of thcentury intellectual veneer against thcentury idiom p du boiss new meanings strain against the old idiom but it will not yield when mark twain observed that james fenimore cooper wrote dialogue badly he explained that cooper wrote it badly because he did not listen to the way that people talk or did not have occasion to talk with characters of the type about whom he wrote but twain considered himself a judge of literature not a psychiatrist bones comments on james weldon johnson reveal his inconsistency andif i may be forgiven for adopting his critical approach reveal the subliminal tension between his aesthetic judgments and his social biases pleased with the artistic merits of the autobiography of an excoloured man and with johnsons defense of ragtime and the cakewalk bone treats lightly the fact that johnsons protagonist has higher aspirations the lowlife milieu of the harlem school is hardly his johnsons natural habitat p a less competent novelist would have been condemned as assimilationist for implying that there are higher aspirations part iithe discussion of the renaissanceis markedly superior to the first but weakens eventually from bones stubborn effort to fit all the writings into the framework of assimilationism versus negro nationalism to indicate his approval of the talented rebels of the renaissance bone describes them as the intelligensia a term unfortunately more restrictive and less appropriate than talented tenth which he continues to use as a cudgel against the middleclass before he ends his introduction however bone dumps the intelligensia into the camp of harlem nationalists at war with the talented tenthmiddleclass advocates of the genteel tradition even in his discussion of the harlem school mr bones biases govern his aesthetic judgments he condemns the early novelists because they revealed their contempt for the masses by introducing in their works characters resembling those of the minstrel shows he praises the harlem writers for daring to create characters who run dangerously close to the stereotype p and he continues to reveal unconsciously the limitations in his knowledge of negro life limitations which affect both his social theories and his interpretations of the works for instance he writes in the early negro novel a professor was a school teacher inflated achievement in the harlem school novel a professor is strictly the third party to a rickety piano and a precarious glass of beer p but one familiar with idiom of the south knows that well into the forties fessuh was the generic title for all male teachers a novelist failing to use the term would have violated the idiom which bone wishes to protect it is difficult not to suspect that bone praises the harlem writers not merely because they are competent craftsmen but because despite occasional extravagances they more honestly reveal the negro as bone believes him to be bone for instance examines claude mckays characters as symbols whereas he derides the characters of the early novelists as counterstereotypes or minstrels his chief criticism of home to harlem and banjo is that ray mckays spokesman is too intellectual to permit mckay to renounce anglosaxon civilization as emphatically as bone expects he extols mckays achievement in banana bottom in which bita the protagonist marrying jubban embraces the beauty of peasant life similarly although bone mentions the structural defects of langston hughes not without laughter his principal criticism is that by sending the protagonist back to school hughes contradicts his major themethat negroes cultivate the spirit of joy because achievement is largely illusory for them since bone finds no ambivalence or inconsistency in hughes attitudes towards racial matters in other works one wonders whether hughes did not say exactly what he desiredthat the negro must embrace joy and seek success perhaps it is merely bone who believes that one cannot exist in company with the other bones eloquent praise of jean toomer compensates for the fact that almost all of the biographical information is inexact toomers parents were not cultivated negroes of creole stock at least toomer never assumed that his georgiaborn father was the household tradition of tales of slavery exists factually only in bones imagination in fact toomer was eighteen before he became fully aware of the dramatic role which his grandfather p b s pinchback had played in the reconstruction toomer did not study law he did not turn to literature as quickly as bone implies but he did undertake a brief literary apprenticeship in cosmopolitan new york it is ironic that toomer whom he praises for having never underestimated the importance of his negro identity p should have been the very one to proclaim loudest the statement which bone ridicules as the selfdeluding myth of the assimilationist i am not a negro i am an american on this issue of which he must have been aware bone is silent although bone cannot be blamed for wanting to discuss toomer cane is not a novel neither toomer nor the liveright publishers considered it such bones other errors in interpreting cane result merely from his excusable ignorance of the man and his other writings the errors however illustrate the danger of building a man a philosophy and a myth upon the subjective reading of one literary work in the final chapter of part ii the hapless middleclass become spokesman of negro philistia principally because of their attacks on the harlem artists in this chapter more perhaps than in any other bone suffers a colorblindness which prevents his recognizing that du boiss objections to subject matter of novels and benjamin brawleys objections to jazz do not reflect racial posture but artistic standards it is difficult to draw a significant racial distinction between w d howells attack upon russian naturalistic novels and du boiss disgust with what he believed to be the filth of home to harlem similarly englishteacher brawleys criticism of the grammar of the lyrics of jazz is echoed today by many nonnegro critics of rock and roll but subconsciously believing that all worthy negroes should possess identical artistic standards bone flails them with arguments sometimes supported by misused quotations james weldon johnson whose instinct was always sound in such matters vigorously defended the lowerclass negro as higher literary material it takes nothing less than supreme genius he once remarked to make middleclass society black or white interestingto say nothing of making it dramatic p johnson says nothing here about higher literary material whatever that may be he says that it is hard to write dramatically about middleclass people if he implies that it is therefore easier to write about lowerclass people he implies equally that it is easier to write about upperclass people such a blatant misuse of a source is as reprehensible as is the laudatory statement on the back cover of the negro novel in america which implies endorsement by the cla journal when in fact the quotation was taken from an article in the journal not even from a review suffering most in the chapter is jessie fauset who was never able to transcend the narrow limits of her sheltered background p granted that miss fausets novels do not please surely the cause must be more than the kind of family background which edith wharton used advantageously miss fausets literary sin is not her failure to rebel against the kind of family which bone implies a negro ought not to have her sins are a diction which was outmoded by and an inability to structure a plot effectively but bone ignores these artistic weaknesses to concern himself only with her family and her literary intentions even though he averred in the beginning that he would always establish the work of art in its own right before viewing it as part of the cultural process p in part iii bone insists less on the struggle between assimilationism and nationalism it is just as well for some of the novelists he must discuss demonstrate a basic weakness of bones thesisit fails to consider that the writer by the very fact of his publishing is becoming a part of the dominant culture regardless of the thesis he expresses in his work in his private life arna bontemps surely must represent the middleclass negroes or the talented tenth who have adopted or have inherited the values identified with white middleclass americans of the protestant ethnic group and who by bones definition are assimilationist yet bontemps novel which bone praises most highly is black thunder which bone believes is marred primarily by excessive race pride ie negro nationalism commendably bone calls attention to george henderson and william attaway whose novels should be better known while discussing these and richard wright he demonstrates that he has competence when he restricts himself to literary judgments zora neale hurston benefits from bones appraisal which points to the virtues of her work and minimizes her exploitation of the exotic in the speech and habits of negroes her caricaturing of negroes whose philosophies differed from hers her acceptance of the caste philosophy characteristic of the plantation tradition and her focus upon the atypical culture of eatonville florida as might be expected he judges harshly seraph on the suwanee which lacks the exotic charm of her earlier novels about negroes curiously he ignores moses man of the mountain which is perhaps miss hurstons most delightful work part iv challenged bone because for the first time he was forced to discuss a number of novelists who wrote nonnegro novels he met the challenge by dismissing frank yerby as the prince of pulpsters an allegation irrelevant to his thesis that novels by negroes must be significantly different and by defining as assimilationist such writers as richard wright chester himes zora neale hurston and ann petry when they wrote about white protagonists in parts iv and v he reveals his best work judging ellison and baldwin who lend themselves to mythic or symbolic interpretation he can propound explications which are provocative even if they do not always reflect the artists intentions near the conclusion of his book bone states the truth which should have dissuaded him from the thesis upon which he based literary as well as social judgments little remains to be said of these novelists as a group for like all real artists their work is highly individualistic p having reached this understanding he can merely vacillate in the advice he offers negro novelists in a postscript the negro novelist should not sacrifice his art to the nonliterary attempt to correct social injustices let the negro novelist as citizen as political man vent his fury and indignation through the appropriate protest organizations but as novelist as artist let him pursue his vision his power of seeing and revealing which is mankinds rarest gift p absorbed with the beauty of his phrases bone fails to observe that if mans rare gift makes him see injustice then artistic integrity requires him to reveal it this will be called protestif it is ineptly writtenfurthermore bone continues the negro writer should not seek to evade writing about the ghetto because if he does then it will lack an interpreter p as soon as one judges art by adding the historical dimension bone states one realizes that the novelist is not free to deal with negro life when he does not write about the ghetto p thus bone finally unmasks to reveal himself as one of those whom he cited richard gibson as castigatingthe professional liberal who reminds the negro writer that he cannot possibly know anything else but jim crow sharecropping slum ghettoes georgia crackers p bone concludes his advice with the reminder that although the negro novelist can write about anything he knows his early novel should be about negroes because most negro novelists will produce only one or two novels p he knows this to be a fact because most negro novelists have produced only one or two novels in the beginning was mr bone s assertion of the need for a book which evaluated negro writers novels according to artistic standards if mr bone had limited himself to that task he would have succeeded despite his predilection for works lending themselves to mythic interpretation as a cultural historian or as a psychiatrist of the mentalities of millions of negroes however he is less than adequate today i saw an old t v man counting his steps several minutes passed before i realized that both of us were trying to cross the street and by that time a tall skinny lady in a chemise coat rushed up and grabbed his arm she talked to him for a moment he shook his head then she pulled him across the street holding up her hand to the approaching cars while he waved his faded red and white cane in a wide circular motion i followed keeping a measured distance behind when they reached the other side of the street she leaned over and whispered to him he nodded his head again and drooled on his faded gray jacket in an apparent attempt to smile she shook her head at me and another lady who had stopped to stare and then walked away with her head held ridiculously high he stood there for a moment tapping on the ground with his cane the way all old blind men with canes do acting as if they can send out morse code messages to the sidewalk to roll them to the places they want to go he stepped stopped stepped again and i saw that he was probably going to bump into the apartment building on the comer if someone didnt help him i stood there feeling stupid for watching and wondering why i was there at all another lady who happened to be passing by cautiously approached him asked a few questions and led him away looking at me with what i felt to be utter contempt i immediately felt ashamed on the way home i could not forget the mans face then i thought of simon for the first time in ten years simon always looked as if he had been dipped in grease and had then allowed some freestyle sculptorer to carve dirt into every line of his cinnamoncolored face and his patched beige suit his clothes hung from every limb and he resembled the pictures you sometimes see around halloween of masquerading skeletons at precisely six oclock every evening he would stop in front of my house head bowed body bent as if at any moment he expected numerous blows from behind a copper cup holding a pebble tied by a grime and grease smeared handkerchief to a faded red and white cane in one hand and a rustinfected cow bell in the other would literally ring me out of my chores to lead him home most of the time i arrived panting from what i laughingly called my fast getaway for although i expected him everyday at six i was always afraid that one day he would not make it during the two years he stopped at my house though i asked him many times he never told me how he got there and i never worried enough to find out here i am i would say and his cautious old hound would whine and lick my hand the old mans owlish eyes would roll around in their sockets in a useless attempt to focus on me i imagine we were an interesting looking couple a thin brown girl with legs and arms too long for anything except leaping and hugging with rulerlength hair the color and texture of a boar bristle brush m i i i would lead him past dingy usedfurniture stores with cracked windows past oneroom churches where even at that time of day holy rollers were holding services and some lay twisting on the floor shouting while others hung out the doors praying for a breeze eyeing the parade of condemned nonchalant sinners outside past heat french names like la boutique and singed hair dresser shops with chateau coiffures where sweating hairdressers shared their space with americanstyled primebred fat and greasy rats and roaches that looked as if shampoo cremes and hair pomades were the healthiest diets in the world past maggotpacked restaurants with loud juke boxes which always seemed to be playing billie holiday records on and on until finally we would come to the alley where simon disappeared and i was sure he lived i never took him more than halfway into the garbagestaled urinedrenched alley i would watch him for a few minutes and then run out of that alley like a whipdriven horse leaving simon with the odors that invariably threatened my stomach the walk home was mine and treasured it more than my first pair of high heel shoes and silk stockings i thought of myself as an angel or undiscovered saint for at least ten minutes of the walk home i would remember how i had forced myself to walk slowly with simon instead of pulling him along behind me i could almost hear this or that neighbor saying isnt mattie a dignified child wearing pants all the time didnt count see how she takes time with old simon i wish my betty was more like her you never see mattie running after boys yelling and switching up the streets in fact you hardly see the sweet thing at all nellie wont have any trouble next year when the child goes to high school i would smile and think of how my mother would answer these comments well matties a perfect little lady now and has been since her twelfth birthday this june i told her then that when a girl makes that age she has to act different she has to stop talking so loud and popping gum and help me around the house more shes a little lazy but i dont have any real trouble with her thank the lord i didnt notice that i was acting any differently i never could pop gum or talk loud and i had always had to do housework since mama had worked for as long as i could remember nevertheless these thoughts would please me and almost push a nagging guilt out of my mind for whenever i saw simon for some reason or another i thought of mrs petrie mrs petrie lived next door and had arthritis her legs looked like swollen bowling pins and she never went anywhere she and her cigarsucking husband had lived in their stuffed musty apartment for as long as i could remember and she had always had arthritis he had always chewed or sucked an unlit halfsmoked cigar it could have been the same one for all i know because i never saw him smoking anyhow mother would make me go and sit with mrs petrie and read the bible and as soon as i was old enough to go to the store alone i had to run errands for her she was a kind woman and would always smooth my braids down they always stuck out at that time and tell me what a pretty thin face i had it was from mrs petrie that i learned how my full lips and large eyes would one day be my best assets i would sit quietly on her broken down hassock while she adjusted her glasses and she would either hum church hymns or talk in a broken creole dialect maddee you must neber poot dat powda on you smooth putti face i never tired of her talk her compliments were like my favorite chocolates almost too sweet to eat so that long after they had been digested the sweet flavor lagged behind to tease my mouth the family joke was how very much i ate and how skinny i grew working at digesting it as time passed however i grew restless because i always felt guilty and sometimes my manner with mrs petrie was painfully abrupt mrs petrie would send me to the grocery store every saturday and i would buy the petries food for the week after the first month i figured it out mr petrie never went past the comer and from there no grocery store was in sight in that household newspapers didnt exist mrs petrie certainly didnt know the cost of foods so i learned to cheat them first it was dimes later it was quarters and finally i managed to cheat them out of two and three dollars at a time of course they always paid me for shopping but somehow cents never seemed like much for standing in saturday morning grocery lines fighting women with babies and shopping carts and badtempered food checkers i always felt guilty but i never felt guilty enough to stop extra money was unheard of in my house daddy barely made enough for necessities when i saw him and that wasnt often since he worked two jobs and slept when he was at home he never had any moneyor so he said mother was different she was thrifty she saved everything and it was useless to ask for anything other than that which could be proven to be needed but i managed and did so with a fair amount of ease i was smart enough not to splurge and buy anything expensive which could be used as evidence such as records books or puzzles these things i loved in those days i consumed a lot of sodas and malts miraculously my figure and skin never showed it mrs petrie always said that the williams girl must be the most wellmannered trustworthy child on the block and how she loved church i did not love church i could not go anywhere else when i was allowed outside to play i could not cross the street because mama said the children were too bad betty and joyce werent ladies and the boys pitched pennies i did not have a bicycle and definitely could not play hide and seek with the other girls and boys mother said that since i was lefthanded i owed the devil a days work and he was not going to collect it if she had anything to do with it so to church i went so i could get saved and cheat the devil out of his due on sundays i went to sunday school at in the morning i doddled through oclock service and evening vespers on tuesdays thursdays and fridays i went to the btu the btu was baptist training union for all young christians desirous of being saved mother said that rev metcalfe was sure to put plenty of holy things on my mind and she was partially right he put plenty on my mind he would pace in his pulpit roaring and stomping his feet calling for all sinners to come forth and repent although everyone at the btu except ancient church stewards was sent by his parents and was truly desirous of being saved so he could die and go to heaven and lie in the arms of jesus and drink milk mixed with honey for ever and ever and yet every sunday evening at rev metcalfe opened the doors of the church and proceeded to eloquently beg the sinners to come forth confess and repent you know who you are he would shout jesus knows who you are let not your hearts be troubled anymore let jesus take your burdens repent repent truly the lord knows your heart at precisely this point he always made the same speech the tears would begin to slide down my cheeks and i would feel like i was coming down with the flu or catching hay fever the steward who strutted back and forth in front of the congregation in her stiff nurses uniform thats what all the stewardesses wore head bobbed and bent arms folded shouting my my my everytime the preacher made a point would rush over and pat me on the shoulder and everyone except my mother and cousins would think i had been moved or touched by the spirit the stewardess whose name was bessie would assure me that the lord knew my heart and that would make me cry even more because that meant he knew i was thinking bad thoughts and feeling very guilty about mrs petrie now that i think about it my thoughts werent bad i did not always think about boys and when i did there was usually one in particular all i wanted to do was play hide and seek with the boys jump rope ride bicycles and cross the street to play with the bad kids but mrs petrie and simon were my playmates and now some ten years later i find myself feeling guilty about some old man i dont even know and thinking about simon and wondering what mrs petrie would say if she could see my short hair and still thin but powdered face my painted lips and short skirts and wondering why when we moved to a new house and clean neighborhood the year i was i never went back not even once to visit in the years that followed and wondering why i was wondering about any of it at all what was wrong with me why had i stood there like that and foolishly watched the man struggle why hadnt i helped him but thousands of blind people lived in the world and for every one of them there were people who could see and would help why should i have been the one let the other nine do it i never could understand why i could cross five main streets to lead simon home and cross two main streets to go and buy groceries for mrs petrie yet never cross one little street to play with those other children mother had said that that was different it was she suddenly said no knew that that was what she meant qji a no what his voice already seemed further away quite distant why no dont come up but his voice was rising with that chafing that she had come to know perhaps too well im downstairs at the reception desk no she insisted as a matter of fact go home im going to bed youre not well he said im coming up youd better not coolly slipping out of the satin pumps that caused her considerable discomfort i might have you arrested for molesting me and she carefully replaced the receiver in its cradle expecting it to ring immediately afterward but when after three or four minutes it still had not rung she lifted the receiver waiting for the operator to respond alio oui the abrupt precise sound of the operators voice irritated her even more than an american counterparts for there was something pressing urgent in the little intake of breath terminating the salutation something insisted intimidatingly that all responses be in french well she wasnt having any she was through with her useful words and phrases shed used them all up id like to have a menu brought up please in very concise english but i can repeat the dinner menus to you madame if you like the voice assured her really quite cheerfully quite pleased and in excellent english in spite of a previous determination to be difficult she melted smiling oh would you the menus were repeated with added suggestion that the blanquette de veau was exceptionally good the voice had had it for dinner and it had been delicious recalling that blanquette de veau was one of the things shed learned to adore within a few scant days in france she ordered that along with a bottle of rose incidentally miss if anyone should call would you please say that i am not in i want to get to sleep as early as possible without being disturbed of course madame would that be all the voice retained throughout its pitch of impersonal though friendly concern and she was touched yes except i wonder if there isnt a travel agency near the hotel the hotel can handle all travel arrangements for you if you wish oh yes she remembered the thoughtfulness and service made one feel like staying and staying but she had made up her mind id like a reservation on the earliest possible flight to new york she said satisfied that now it was in motion it was being done by tomorrow night at the latest she would be home in her own little flat telephoning addie dishing all the dirt a voyage to paris had not been among her plans for the future so it seemed incongruous that she should find herself there now one day as it were she had taken a stroll down fifth avenue and suddenly found herself peering inquisitively through the window of the french national tourist bureau without hesitating she had entered got herself engaged in pleasant conversation with a charming woman and left the office nearly an hour later a little stack of convincing brochures clutched in a gloved hand then she had stopped in at doubledays and brought one of those useful words and phrases albums and gone straight home feeling that this indeed might be the year it occurred to her that she hadnt been saving all that money for a vacation that in some psychological improbable way it may have represented her hopes for the future a dowry the thought had occurred to her but shed shrugged it off certain that that had nothing to do with it men she had no real problems on that score although the fact remained she hadnt yet encountered the man not yet she didnt doubt that men found her interesting but she did not often find them interesting in return which led her to the suspicion that she might be too particular was she too particular she felt sure that she was not for she had had her moments unfortunately only one of them could be deemed truly brilliant and she could not recall much more of him than the pertinent fact he had surely not been the man had he been they might be together now here in this hotel this hotel that was smothering her with services she couldnt quite get used to someone tapped at the door and she stifled the feeble oui that issued up from her throat service a youthful deep rumble penetrated the heavy door which she opened a young waiter impeccably clad in crisp white jacket black bowtie and a generous smile wheeled a table laden with covered silver servingdishes into the room voulezvous mangez toute de suite madame oh ah you speak english yes oh yes she said sorry that none of her useful words and phrases sprang to mind will you eat now or later the boy spoke in halting english but with an easy disarming cheerfulness busily setting a place at the little table beside the window thank you she flushed embarrassed by an inability to match the boys lack of constraint you are american yes the boy beamed yes then it is a pleasure to see you it is not often that we have a lady like you in the hotel like me what was coming she tensed balancing on the balls of her feet ready to fly at the boys least insult yes noire but not noire oh we have had many groups from vafrique but it is not the same no you are more like our gentilles antiliaises antiliaises she settled back onto her heels i think you say in english west indian ladies yes oh yes eating her solitary dinner she thought about the boy who had been charming with a forthright simplicity that she had never known in the united states americans she thought a little defensively have a charm different and distinct the charm of jeanclaude for example could only be compared to that of other european men jeanclaude where was he having his dinner or was he having it at all perhaps in a rush of gallic defiance hed gone through that purported list of french girls less prudent than you american girls she had giggled inwardly then and giggled outwardly now the thought that french girls were less opposed than american girls to cold clammy hands that roamed uninvited seemed preposterous to her she hadnt been convinced and he hadnt come anywhere near the point what was it that could turn her definitively on there had been that night when after nearly two weeks of his wheedling she had said all right simply and straightforwardly she had agreed to go take a nitecap at his apartment but it had been the ensuing leer of triumph skittering across his almost too handsome face that signaled a final no nevertheless she had gone up because shed already said yes a completely negligible move as far as she was concerned for she was certain that nothing would come of it and nothing had coming across on the boat she had had a very brief enlightening introduction to european gallantry men had pursued her just as openly as they pursued other unattached girls aboard and it had been mildly amusing then in paris she had encountered jeanclaude who appeared still less concerned with the color of her skin in fact for the briefest moment before doubt began to nudge her naturally wary innerself the idea that here was a man a white man regarding her as just another pretty very eligible girl appealed to her for the briefest moment she suspected that maybe this may be indeed the year and if it turned out to be then how nice to break clear from all that unpleasantness at home she wasnt however bowled over by jeanclaude gallant and attentive in a way totally unfamiliar to her their goodnights at the door of her hotel were never atingle she was never sure whether his approach was truly subtle or just clumsy with that nervous expectancy once aroused in her by say harry jones the harry jones who although long gone into that dim corner of things past had made an unforgettable bid for immortality in her book of things not easily forgotten jeanclaude had taken her to dine in places she sensed to be select and he had shown her to people to whom he waved but who seldom ventured as near as their table when they did it was to address him in rapidfire french that sounded fine and foreign to her cars interspersed as it often was with rich laughter strolling the grands boulevards or in the bois people often stared after or directly at them at such times she would have given an arm or a leg to know just what they were seeing were they seeing a handsome young couple or just a colored girl being misled by a wily frenchman worse did they imagine that here was another baudelaire french unfortunate victimized by an inclination toward vice and the will of an unscrupulous colored girl in any event she rarely pursued it very deeply for she found the entire process terribly unpleasant furthermore she was surprised to discover that it didnt really make much difference to her what they were seeing what they thought jeanclaudes thoughts which he managed extremely well to keep to himself interested her infinitely morethe first time he kissed her well there youve been caught kissing a white man can you get lynched for it flashed through her thoughts and hers was an insensate desire to laugh intended in the spirit of a liberal sense of humor which she did possess she didnt find this particular thought however very funny for definitely in the category sloppy kiss of a nature too inquisitive not commensurate with so brief a relationship it surely would not have been worth getting lynched for having dared she pushed him rather brusquely away whats the matter have i presumed too much his voice already hoarse with anticipation vibrated less chagrin than worry that his technique may have been ineffective and once more she felt an insensate desire to laugh because it occurred to her that the kiss may have been more successful had it been possible for him to embrace himself no she managed to whisper its just that i wouldnt want to be seen like that in the street in the street he was incredulous what difference pulling her toward him this is paris and you mustnt concern yourself with trivialities yes she said wondering how this illusion that paris was so different exempt from simple modesty had permeated the skins of so many thousands convinced them that here more than anywhere else in the world anything was possible nothing mattered she deftly parrying his subsequent attempts at seduction soon escaped into the hotel and up to the calm of her room a definite decision was in order she realized but couldnt bear the prospect of another of those kisses the following night she refused an invitation to accompany him to his flat for a nitecap pouring herself another glass of wine now she finished the remainder of the strawberries then lit a cigarette poor jeanclaude its not that im hard to get im just not easily had like most girls how angry he had been when at last she had relented accompanied him to his flat only to explain to him the impossibility of it all flustered impatient to be on with it he had after a few preliminary kisses begun to explore and tug at the complexities of the various fastenings of her suit she sprang to her feet rearranging her somewhat troubled hair look dear boy a few kisses dont give you free title to the place she said managing a thin smile necessary counter to the anger welling up inside her what jeanclaude scrambled to his feet not having understood and making no effort to conceal what she considered a lack of selfcontrol and therefore a lack of respect for her i mean ive kissed you because i was willing to do it but it doesnt give you the right to undress me the words tumbling from her lips stung how could she explain that there were ways of doing it ways of arriving at that pointofnoreturn how could she explain that it was useless now that he was just a clumsy impatient bear of a man a child no his entire demeanor expressed an innate willingness to knock her down possibly tear away her clothing and achieve his aims in a primitive fashion because it was what he wanted a really primitive affair well no jeanclaude and that goes for all the rest of the apes like you he drove her back to her hotel in a rage of petulant silence during which she merely stared not the least bit wistfully out the window she watched the street feeling a source of history vibrating from the building facades sensing that much of that history had been implement in the formation of the history of her own country her own country there was the thrill she became warm at the thought of a place of her own to return to her own flat in new york city feeling warm and good inside she was already moving toward home turning out the light she crept in between the cool sheets grateful for their caressing smoothness and her last thoughts before drifting off to sleep were oh goodbye jeanclaude i wonder whats on sale at bloomingdales the utrillo print on the wall was the same as ii any other utrillo print a street with leafless trees people and buildings but there were other pictures too and there was a carpet on the floor and elegant chairs to be used by elegant people nina wasnt so elegant there werent many people only four other girls they didnt look as if they just happened to be lucky enough to run off their jobs for a visit to an optometrist they looked as if they could command someone to call the doctor and dictate when they could visit his office the doctor himself was very tall and rather pale but his hair was a golden glowing red also he was a proud walker one could easily understand that from the way his shoulders were upright and drawn back in an almost militaristic manner he was a youngish older man he came out to his reception room to tell his first patient goodbye and he glanced about the room and down at a dark green book he looked up quizzically and politely miss gallagher youre next the girl rose and followed him gratefully it was nina wondered whenor ifher turn would be she thought she should tell him that her appointment had been made over a week ago but then how could she when he hadnt seemed even to notice that she was there when he entered the room perhaps she should not have taken alberts advice perhaps she should have gone to the negro eye doctor the way she had wanted to do but albert had said no that that guy couldnt fix eyes any better than he could and that she would be just wasting her hardearned money and her time you want a doctor he told her go to a doctor not some jackleg of a medicine man who dont know what hes doing and goin overcharge too since she was living with cousin albert and his family she thought she should do what he said out of respect for him rather than for what he thought now this white man was coming out to his fine reception room and not even really paying attention to his little green book if he had he would have seen that she was listed there for thursday noon she hadnt been in new jersey long but she could see that the people were different down home at dr johnsons office there were always a lot of people and sometimes he would rush in and say ill get to you next mrs so and so be patient with me and you didnt mind waiting well you minded but you waited because you knew that doctor was really pressed for time like colored folks get and doing the best he could besides he was a colored man and you were proud that he was a doctor and had his office in your neighborhood although he didnt live there but yet and still you realized he must have had a hard time getting to be a doctor and so you waited at pm the doctor came for another patient he smiled warmly and said sorry i made you wait he was a charming man his eyes were very blue the girl smiled back she was the last white woman nina was the only other patient left nina thought he might decide to close his office and tell her to come back tomorrow like the ones of his kind down home yes he might just decide to close his office she gathered her purse and stood up to go she was angry surely he had written down her name the day she called but he hadnt even seen her she just couldnt understand white folks she didnt like being last either not when she felt that she had called earlier in the week she sat down again no ill stay and i will tell that cracker exactly what i think i had no business coming here this money shouldve gone to a negro doctor anyway these people have enough money already albert hasnt got any race pride or he wouldve seen to it that l had a negro doctor he knew good and well i just got up here but then the doctor was passing by her and opening the door for his patient and he turned toward her youre missjust a second he jerked up the book miss willis come in just sit here she sat down she thought he looked most peculiar as if he were not long awakened he asked a lot of questions now he said i want you to tell me if the red spot you see is moving right left or up and down do you see it yes ok she answered his questions hoping that the examination would not last much longer ever wore glasses before no what type of work do you do factory i work in a mica factory what a mica factory i cut the discs for little television parts its very thin stuff like glass but its not really glass its like plastic i guess do you think some got into your eyes i dont know but they hurt do you read a lot not too much why was he looking at her like that white people up north were most peculiar he said excuse me and left the room now hes making me wait again ive got to get out of here glasses or no glasses the green book was open miss willis she read so she was right her name was number two on his list and he an eye doctor should fix his own eyes here he said wash your eyes no just look up he held the dropper and a stinging mist fell into her eyes doctor im in a hurry why arent your eyes the most important thing yes but i have to get back to my job you have beautiful eyeslike that really lovely he leaned very close to her ive got to go but when she moved from the chair he caught her and held her to himself then he was embracing her then kissing her he didnt seem to hear her say stop and so she said stop white man his body became rigidfor only a secondand then he kissed her again love he said but it wasnt actually the word he used is the supreme equalizer the supreme equalizer let me go let me go no when i saw you come in i knew i knew in your eyes micas in my eyes you do believe that love this time he said loveis the supreme equalizer dont you why dont you believe black white they dont matter love brings you to my level love and he said a lot of things in the same vein his red hair rumpled and his suit completely disheveled his eyes were very wild and he seemed much too red and very exhausted as if he might fall over or something ive got to get out of here nina was thinking if this white man should die they would put the blame on me they would surely put the blame on me she straightened her clothes and fixed her hair watching the man he was composed now and he wore the white seemingnottosee look just as he had worn it earlier as she sat in the waiting room his eyes were cold blue again but there was still the slightest bit of warmth in them quickly nina turned to leave the doctor was sitting in the chair where she had sat and he was looking at her she was drawn toward him but then she ran out the door still she could hear his warm gentle voice saying just remember love is the supreme equalizer nina was a great distance from the elegant office before she could think about her job or about cousin albert oh lord she panicked what will i tell that fool cousin of mine and then she said to herself white folks are the same everywhere they all think that theres at least one thing a black person got to do to be equal to them theres always at least one little thing for historian lerone bennett jr one of the beautiful experiences at the core convention in california was listening to ambassador michael lukumbuzya of tanzania the ambassador is unique in many ways to begin with he is dazzlingly eloquent without exhibiting any of the arrogance which usually accompanies such eloquence then he has no apparent problems of status which is one of the handicaps which befall many highranking africans when it comes to communicating with afroamericans and best of all the ambassador sees the complexities of power in the world as clearly as he speaks ambassador lukumbuzya is a spokesman for his countrys political position which is considerably to the left of where most of the western powers would like it to be like his president julius nyerere he has no illusions about making it in a world where the big powers swallow the little underdeveloped countries almost at will on the other hand he has no intention of selling the people of tanzania tanganyika and zanzibar down the hatch in the name of interdependency and cooperative development at the second conversations with africa conference sponsored by the phelpsstokes fund at capahosic virginia last spring see the july negro digest ambassador lukumbuzya had the occasion to state his countrys position with great emphasis he was advised by a smooth afroamerican an employee of some years with the state department that interdependency seemed the best way of bringing such underdeveloped countries as tanzania into the modern world the government man was joined by a distinguished afroamerican jurist who suggested that afroamerican dollars invested in black africa was a means of providing muchneeded capital without raising his voice above its customary level of quiet emphasis the ambassador attacked he described how interdependency worked in black africa by citing an example in his own country a mineral exploiting firm had been invited into the country to establish a mining complex the assumption being that the industry would result in new jobs satellite industries and a viable new community what actually happened was that the exploiters came in ravaged the earth of its valuable minerals provided no homes or technological work or training for the local citizens and then departed the area leaving exhausted mines and general despair however the mineral wealth was taken out of africa the ambassador made it quite clear that tanzania would have no more of that he also made it clear that afroamericans were welcome in tanzaniabut only if they came to help that is only if they came to tanzania willing to join with the people there live with them share with them and grow with them afroamericans are no more welcome to come into tanzania as exploiters than any other americansor europeansand especially since so many afroamericans these days are roaming the nonwhite world as agents of the same old white masters what is so wonderful about ambassador lukumbuzya apart from his views is the fact that he takes the time to meet with and to communicate with his black brothers in america this cannot endear him with the power interests in this country but it makes him beautifully black frederick campbell is a painter with the keen insight of a sociologist but with an essential difference he has a deep love and appreciation for the objects of his painters eye and his affection shows in the strokes of his brush which capture illuminating moments and emotions in the faces and gestures of his subjects the artists memory is long in the april issue of ebony magazine a startlingly graphic picture was published showing a woman reclining voluptuously on a bed while her husband sat on the beds edge the photograph was one of a number used to illustrate the plight of black southern migrants who had moved to california to find work as cotton pickers and had found racism and unemployment instead more than a decade later mr campbell remembered that womans pose in his painting the hustler which projects an entirely different context from the california scene and where pickers way after he finds inspiration the painting the evolved in the everycotton following a book calledreading drum i wanted to paint a picture of the type of negro i thought was depicted in the book mr campbell said one thing led to another so i began thinking that the reason we dont all look alike is among other things because we came from different types of black people to begin with now the plot thickens i added to my idea a woman knowing of at least two different types imported to this countryone of the true negroid type coming from the baluba or bacuba tribes the man and two coming from the mangbetu tribes which are almost mongoloid in appearance the woman now having gotten this fixed needed a composition so i thought a straightforward approach would be best when this was done i thought of how much it reminded me of the grant wood painting american gothic so i wanted to add something of underlying meaning and feeling to my people i put a faint smile of diplomatic temporary submission on the mans lips but with hidden defiance showing in his eyes the woman is showing withdrawn but stubborn defiance which could be mistaken as a squint because of the sun the background shows the bareness our people found in the new land that was forced on them mr campbell is a native philadelphian and a former student at the hussian school of art last spring a major exhibition of his paintings and drawings was presented at the hampton institute college museum by curator dr richard a long
what might herald an w awakening seems now to be in progress among the influential molders of public opinion in the united states of america it is taking place as a reaction to the angry violent and widespread outbursts of afroamericans which led to the serious casualties in several important cities notably newark and detroit such is the conclusion reasonably to be inferred from a survey of the editorial page of the new york times of sunday july this journal be it noted is the most conservative and powerful daily paper published in the usa the leading editorial of the times seeks to assess the responsibility white and black it begins by observing that the powerful forces of this revolt are unprecedented there follows immediately the extraordinary quotation of that penetrating analysis of the world situation made at the opening of this century by the farseeing dean of afroamerican letters william edward burghardt dubois the very man who was condemned as a radical and arrested and humiliated as such at the behest of the power structure now the opening paragraph of this editorial in the new york times quotes as follows the words of the noted negro scholar dr w e b dubois were prophetic when he wrote decades ago the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color linethe relation of the darker to the lighter races of man this editorial then goes on to make the following significant acknowledgement and admission white americans of course must share the greater burden of responsibility the attempt is also made to spell out this responsibility in briefto help achieve full equality by certain concrete measures it is further recognized that negro americans too have their responsibilities which must be met if this confrontation crisis is to be overcome these responsibilities are seen by the new york times in terms of faith in the promise of america and the assurance blandly offered after some years years if the colonial period be included that its democratic institutions and democratic ethic must be seen as the high road that no basic change of policy is yet intended is apparent in the lapse into a tirade against paranoid rabble rousers and specifically against the h rap browns this is followed by a demand upon the negro community to make them powerless but no matter how afroamericans may disagree with some of the more impulsive utterances of young spokesmen like h rap brown it is certain generally that they will not respond to a summons to render up such youth leaders as sacrificial lambs still more significant however are certain statements made by new york times columnist c l sulzberger in foreign affairs the fractured giant pointing to divisions ripping apart the american structure this writer moves directly to the recognition race is not only our most important national issue but also our most important international issue pointing further to the nonwhite world majority this correspondent concludes we cannot forever entertain wholesome peaceful relationships abroad unless we compose our own racial disputes this analyst then probes for the cause and finds no logical explanation of racism or even an acceptable definition of race on which anthropologists can agree looking back into history for the origin of racism c l sulzberger arrives at the basic and revealing facts as follows until the fifteenth century europefrom which our ancestors cameknew no such prejudices it developed only as exploration opened foreign lands inhabited by sources of labor that could easily be enslaved here it should be observed that this is the same basic historical analysis which has been set forth and documented in the book the name negro its origin and evil use the commentator sulzberger continued with the following significant observation this cynical factor was most efficiently exploited in africa our second great continent of origin and because we blandly ignored the constitution and the bill of rights for decades ignoring the claim of afroamericans to be free as euroamericans and even today disputing their claim to be equal we are at last paying the bill it is enlightening to note how by delving into history to find the origin of race in the development of the modern slave system this analyst and commentator was thus brought directly to the continental origins of the two major groups of the population of the u s a through his understanding of prior history culture and lands of origin and also because of his emphasis on freedom this writer is thereby led logically easily and naturally to use the appropriate terms and names to designate these two great groups of citizens of the u s a namely afroamericans and euroamericans here indeed is a cardinal lesson and it is to be hoped a signficant beginning of the removal of prejudice from american habits of thought speech daily practice and customary attitude in a third article on this same editorial page of the new york times the two faces of the negro revolution william v shannon attempts to assess the present violence and unrest among afroamericans in the light of similar great upheavals elsewhere having not yet attained to the historical understanding of the background as arrived at by sulzberger shannon continues to use though perhaps unconsciously the racist slave designation negroes nevertheless a step forward is taken toward the recognition of americans of african descent as human by considering these present eruptions of afroamericans as in some respects like the natives in a europeanruled colony or the submerged workers in paris and st petersburg before the french and russian revolutions but no mention is made of the haitian revolution of or of its signal role in the abolition of chattal slavery and later in the liberation of latin america through the decisive aid rendered to general bolivar by president petion of haiti nor does mr shannon recall the uprisings throughout the caribbean during in barbados alone the toll was killed wounded and jailed these socalled disturbances signalled a turning point from colonialist subjugation towards advancement and independence specifically comparing the present situation with events in algeria in the late s and in ireland in william v shannon notes the conflict arising between leaders liberal and middle class in their outlook and the radicals who challenged and supplemented them the new radicals shannon concludes the stokely carmichaels and the h rap browns are challenging the older middle class negro leaders on quite different grounds for them the analogy of the negro revolution is with the nationalist revolutions of independence correctly and cogently shannon observes yet mere economic gains will not relieve the anger resentment and damaged selfrespect of people who feel separated from their fellow americans not only by economic inequality but also by the color of their skin while we agree with this writer that neither harlem nor newark nor mississippi is likely to become an independent negro republic we are nevertheless certain that the solution is not to be found simply or solely in negro owned street corner businesses and the houses in which negroes take community pride far more fundamental changes in the whole structure of american society and in its mores customs and attitudes will have to be achieved in order to bring about peaceful and viable relations not only must full economic opportunity be achieved in business and in executive positions and in labor especially in the higher crafts and the skills of tomorrow but also political voting administration and power as well as cultural recognition and the frank accordance of human dignityall are essential to a genuine solution as the great afroamerican leader frederick douglass declared long ago in his reply to president andrew johnson at the outset of the reconstruction period after the civil war peace between races is not to be secured by degrading one race and exalting another by giving power to one race and withholding it from another but by maintaining a state of equal justice between all races first pure then peaceable it is pedestrian enough a beginning to say that i was a college senior myself seventeen years ago though still relatively young i feel that the years of my public life fit me to say something relevant to the college graduates of today in retrospect of those years have been spent in the pastoral and preaching ministry the remainder have been almost equally divided between being a revolutionary and being a part of the establishment when i think back to at the time when i was a college graduate what i would have wanted most was for someone to tell me the truth about the kind of world that awaited me speeches addresses and some sermons are a dime a dozen but the presentation of truth is awesome to speak it requires courage to write the truth is very often dangerous to live it guarantees an early death cf one galilean named jesus for the sake of brevity suffice it to say that there are some things about the society you are about to enter that ought to be verbalized just in case you havent found out already there are three points that i submit for your close scrutiny the first has to do with a crime the second has to do with vietnam and the third has to do with god crime we must face the harsh reality that the endproduct of our american system is a racist society based on color prejudice most of the process takes place by calculated design accommodation to the racist result is largely involuntary to be specific the crime i mentioned above is the crime of the western historians who have carefully written the black man out of the chronicles of the past the psychosis of racial supremacy requires removaldestruction of the objectionable kindand so by historical genocide the black men in world and western civilization were done in by men who knew better but accommodated themselves and their tasks to city hall the crown the ku klux klan whatever that is the crime rob a people of their sense of history and you take away their hope but it is not alone a crime against black men it is also a crime against all other men the absence of truth in history made them become involuntary race supremacists during the most critical and formative years of childs development the days of public and private school lifethe learning materials used the history texts the social studies books are and per cent white the domination of white over black that began in this hemisphere with the slave trade has been perpetually and persistently reenforced in the total learning process of the individual and the group in america honesty impels me to confess that we black people have been mentioned however in those sparse instances where black life was noticed the distortions are almost unbearable when compared to the truth how can i explain to my three sons and daughter that frederick douglass is a far more attractive hero than booker t washington when there is no record of a frederick douglass in most public school history texts is it no wonder that white children are poisoned with racism and prejudice as soon as they learn their abcs as far as the record discloses black people began as slaves small wonder that negroes repress any thought or notion of their slave ancestry for the books not only disclose it as a fact but strongly infers that we didnt resist slavery white america has never had a chance to understand and comprehend the horroryes the horror of slavery in america i request equal time and attention for our slave experience given the jews who were exterminated under hitler what would an accurate chronicle of the foregoing reveal how interesting that absolutely authentic and documented sources detail highly developed ancient subsahara nations which paralleled the nations of the dark ages in europe that means that while anglos and saxons were living in caves in the forests and using stone axes to find something to eat in the heart of africa there were kings and princes and exporters and importers great schools of learning precise systems of currency and what must be considered for that age advanced technology that included the weaving of cloth and the smelting of brass and iron yes we were slaves but before that we were kings and queens and men of commerce and industry we never did like slavery and our masters knew it before there were more than slave revolts how is it that i never knew of nat turner and denmark vesey until i became a student at virginia union i repeat that the endproduct of our american system as it is now constructed is a racist society white and black alike the brainwashing affected us too i recall vividly now that after reading seventhgrade geography my impressions of slavery were not very bad but i dare you to review the autobiography of frederick douglass and to read the description of the cruel disposition of peoplefathers mothers sons and daughterson the occasion of an estate being settled after a certain slave owners death this is a small indication of why the churchrelated and independent colleges must be preserved it is to virginia unions honor and glory that the study of negro heritage is required to say that the endproduct of our american system is a racist society is a severe indictment but it also is accurate and sound it is sound or why else has america been unable to respond to the increasingly incessant demand for unqualified equal opportunity by the black community much of the hysteria that surrounds black_power is directly traceable to the nations guilt during the last dozen years after the most frenetic activity in the race relations arena in the wake of thousands of jailings hundreds of thousands of dollars expended and millions of ergs of energy invested the black community finds itself in worse condition now than it was in whereas the use of black_power as a slogan is tatically unsound the larger community must understand the legitimacy of this cry of despair and frustration when you draw the bottom line we are further behind than we were when the supreme court ruled favorably in the historic brown vs board of education case in what is the nations excuse can you be convinced that we do not have the material resources or the creative programs or the knowhow we do not have the will it is the perennial lowpriority given to the concerns of the black community in america that has spawned the black_power spectrum america cannot blame stokely carmichael america needs to blame america let me suggest a for instance we have had a major and specific voting rights bill years overdue the department of justice has notcannot will notprovide sufficient federal registrars to guarantee the unhampered right to vote all over the south the alleged problem manpower yet in the santo domingo crisis some months ago within hours america put marines ashore it is a clear matter of priority the bare reality is that america does not yet have the moral maturity to deal totally with the dilemma of race until america is able to digest the concept of intermarriage there will not be any lasting and significant breakthrough in race relations to narrow the province of my selection of a partner in marriage to my own kind is to deny my basic humanity if you do not accept me first as a human being then you do not give a tinkers dam as to what kind of job opportunity i have where i live and what kind of education my children secure the die is cast america either we must be provided unqualified equal opportunity or we must be exterminated vietnam the present dilemma in southeast asia and our hysterical response to dissent on the conduct of the war has overtones of this same racism first the fine hand of racism betrays itself in the bitter denunciation of dr martin_luther_king jr i say without reservation that martin_luther_king is the most marvelous human being i have ever encountered this may seem like an overstatement but you see i havent met everybody i need file no brief for dr_kings historical importance time will take care of that im sure he is without peer in the social revolution he is an able and gifted preacher he is a possible throwback to the orators of several generations ago he has had some considerable influence on the theological thinking of our day he was in fact the nobel honoree for peace in this is the man who has been vilified most for taking a position against the war in vietnam consider for a moment that all of the credentials catalogued above are negated because of the circumstances of color who is the adversary in this circumstance there is no need to list the far right the segregationists etc some are former white liberals they presume wrongly that breaking with martin_luther_king leaves their liberality intact they recount their unstinting support of civil_rights and they add but dr_king lost me at the u n they decry the mixing of civil_rights and the peace movement as if to sayand some dothat martin_luther_king is either unqualified to speak on matters of foreign policy or his arena is civil_rights and he ought to stay in his place then there are some former black liberals who presume that they too are qualified i guess by their blackness to denounce dr_king for dragging civil_rights into the peace movement the norfolk journal and guide one of the best papers we have editorialized in this tone the grim portent of hurting the civil_rights movement is underscored without much attention given to rightness or wrongness of dr_kings position in the same vein one of our new york papers headlined a release from the freedom foundation based in valley forge pa i believe thusly responsible negro leadership denounces kings peace stand as i read the article and saw the names of the negroes involved there was no guessing who they were they were the same negroes who a few months and years ago we had to drag literally drag kicking and screaming through the sitins the freedom rides the march on washington and the selma to montgomery march these were the responsible negro leaders who denounced dr_king remember we dragged them kicking and screaming you can have them theyre all yours in the second place somewhere sight has been lost of the fact of the complete immorality of our involvement by what tortuous route did we come by our advisorship and thence to a man war when french colonialism died in southeast asia we were at the side of the french with dollars and materiel helping them to reestablish colonialism colonialism as you know is another name for slavery finally france lost her stomach for that lost cause but we wanted to continue we fought against the geneva accord of unsuccessfully and then refused to sign it then we helped to make diem dictator and kept him dictator until he lost his usefulness to our purposes it is a fact that he was one of the most brutal and corrupt men in asia and chief betrayer of the geneva accord i ask the same question sen robert kennedy asks what are we doing in vietnam i suspect that the u s military bases which ring southeast asia are our only concern and that is selfserving and selfdefeating third there is no connection apparently between dr_kings position on vietnam and that of other outstanding leaders in national and govemment life i refer to the new york times of april where in four different speeches by senators of different political stripe and temperament there is stated the substance of dr_kings speech at the u n senators fulbright mcgovern gruening and robert f kennedy the secretary general of the u n u thant agrees that the escalation of the war in vietnam is moving us toward world war iii dr benjamin spock has not been publicly chided to my knowledge to go back to tending babies but martin_luther_king well i think the message is clear the sum and substance of the king position on vietnam and its connection with human rights in america is a question of the moral capacity of our nation can we respond to the demands of morality if america has no morality beyond her shores how can she be moral at home or stated conversely if america has no morality at home how can she be moral in southeast asia god that brings me to the final concern the challenge of this age is to resist and conquer in each of our own being the racist brainwashing that is still active in our midst if there is no other significance to this day it must be noted that students have had an opportunity to develop their individual potential in an aura of academic freedom and independence thats what virginia union and hampton and morehouse are all about these hallowed grounds and dear old walls reek with the sacrifice of noble saints who refused to go along with the system black and white they believed under god in the full humanity of the newly freed men and their progeny in those early days wooden buildings would have been acceptable but they insisted that the walls be of granite to depict permanence and solidity the form of education was in the classical tradition uncle remus tales would not do for reading lessons it had to be thomas paine and rousseau and latin in iambic pentameter and the greek of xenephons anabasis to be absolutely sure that our grandparents had a chance at exactly the same things the students at harvard and yale and smith received the fundamental basis of that insistence was their commitment to the hebraic christian tradition this is a wicked world but it can be made better the black colleges must survive their best chance is in the extension of black students and their lives to the world as far as we have come we have come most of the way on the strength of our preachers and teachers and doctors and lawyers many of them nameless whose baccalaureate degrees were conferred by the churchrelated and independent colleges and universities that we founded and nurtured in the hebraicchristian tradition the relevance of what i am getting at is corroborated in the lives of the alumni of these institutions it is not by chance that the chairman of the board of trustees of virginia union for example has galvanized his profession into meaningful involvement in the present social revolution dr john holloman has marched and demonstrated in the south for three summers aided by his leadership the medical profession has made wide services available where none were before but more importantly he has been a gadfly within his profession fighting racism unequivocally in the health services of the nation he has taken his fight to the congress of the united states on more than one occasion there are others too numerous to mention milton reid here in virginia walter fauntroy in the nations capital virgil wood in boston these men have committed their lives to the fundamental principles upon which black colleges were founded wherever they work and live whatever they do there is exhibited a tenacity that disclosed they know the things for which they struggle are just and right win lose or draw be under no illusion children have v been brainwashed into believing that they are jy inferior beings it is the general concensus that the white race is responsible for white superiority propaganda there is undoubtedly much truth to this but believe me whites have had some strong allies among negroes themselves negroes who are responsible for the training of young minds must bear a part of the blame for the insecurities among their people i imagine that as far back as the average negro can recollect he has been indoctrinated with the idea of white superiority it is easy to make the white race the scapegoat for this fallacy what few negroes realize or are willing to admit is that if negroes had a firm and secure belief in themselves it would be difficult for someone to give them an inferior image the negroes who are partly responsible for this indoctrination i label negro propagandists these solid citizens band together in social cliques which lack the characteristics of a true social circle and form what i call social knots their members are oound together by a special type of insecurity outwardly they present a picture of efficiency and unquestionable belief in themselves they place themselves above caring what the other race thinks about them they lead the type of social life they lead because that is what they want to do they read certain books and wear certain styles of clothing because that is what they want to do they are beyond being influenced by another supposedly superior group of people at any rate that is what they want others to believe the pathetic truth of the situation is that the negro propagandist is unaware of his own subconscious beliefs in his own racial inferiortiy he has been brainwashed from his mothers knee all the way to adulthood his beliefs are deeply planted the propagandists mother worked for mrs soandso the grandeur and finery of the whitefolks world was breathtaking mrs soandsos spacious house her closets of beautiful clothes her bountifully laden dinner table all left mama flabbergasted to say the least at the end of each weary day mama filled the childrens ears with the splendor of the whitefolks world the beauty of that other world was indelibly imprinted on the minds of the young listeners their daydreams were based on the happiness and the finery they believed existed in the world of mr and mrs soandso character values and human frailties were not ingredients which were included in this world of dreams in the allnegro schools the same children who had listened at mamas knee and who had compared their lots with that of mrs soandso were further brainwashed into believing in the superiority of that other world the negro teacher whose indoctrination had also begun with mamas tales used the phrase like the white people as though it were a whip children please come to school clean and fresh tomorrow comb your hair and wear your nicest outfits the white children will be at the planetarium too listen to classical music because white children listen to classical music dont you want to be like the white children practice good table manners like the white children when these same children reach adulthood they have the tendency to seek ideals they believe white people would embrace they play golf form bridge clubs garden clubs and even take trips to europe for basically the same reason with which they have been indoctrinated since early childhood now there isnt anything wrong in encouraging children to practice good health habits or to desire the finer things in life neither is bridge golf or a european tour undesirable it is the motive for doing these things that is undersirable why not simply do these things because they will enrich ones life one should accept new behavior patterns and ideals because they will make one a happier person the practice of behaving the way one thinks another race behaves in order to acquire happiness is absurd how can one be sure that the adoption of certain behavior patterns can bring happiness what is wrong with enjoying a barbecue instead of a garden party what is wrong with a western film instead of a shakespearean play if one would enjoy and understand it better what is wrong with being ones self just plain you self improvement doesnt come from pretense the idea that another race is truly happy doing these things is based on circumstantial evidence supplied by mama when she worked for mrs soandso is an illiterate domestic worker qualified to properly judge and evaluate all the situations she encounters false assumptions are born this way negro propagandists are usually professional people who are in a position to guide and to help less fortunate negroes seldom do they extend a helping hand instead they assume a special kind of superiority they form tight little social knots whose only purpose is to see which individual can more closely resemble mamas picture of mrs soandso to the outsider their little game of mimicking seems to bring unbelievable pleasures they are secure in their own social paradise but are they really all it would take to rattle their apparent security would be the introduction of one white individual into their knot an example that comes to mind is the announcement made in an allnegro school that there would be a white studentteacher from the nearby recently integrated negro teachers college on the campus in a few weeks plans had to be made the principal carefully scrutinized his faculty to find the best suited criticteacher on his staff after this decision had been made slow learners and unkempt students were ushered into some other teachers classroom when the young apprehensive white student arrived fighting her own preconceived ideas she was presented with a classroom of spotless aboveaverage pupils one lone frightened student had turned an entire school upside down the principal and his faculty are considered to be highly respected members of the society knot why had they panicked why did they have to impress an apprentice in their own field why did inferiority run amuck did they secretly harbor feelings of white superiority its funny perhaps pathetic would be a better wordhow negro propagandists flaunt their superiority over other negroes when they are in their own realms then one lone white individual can shatter their facade the younger generation of negroes has also been able to see through their flimsy veneer they rebel against these modern uncle toms the young lack respect for teachers ministers social workers and even parents who attempt to force upon them a set of values that reek of phony security they ask the question why they find the game of mimicking disgusting not exactly knowing what to do about the situation they lash out against the white race in general and those members of their own race who expect them to swallow such beliefs this type of behavior is as wrong as the negro propagandist who mimics what he believes life is like in the whitefolks world hate campaigns and inferiority campaigns bear the same markings it is time for the negro to stop and reevaluate himself the recently passed civil_rights acts permit them the opportunity of seeing first hand not through mamas eyes what white americans are really like integrated educational facilities gives each individual the chance to judge people by his relationship with them superiority and inferiority have no place in this learning process todays first graders are learning for themselves what my generation had to literally play by ear they are learning that neither race of americans are all perfect or all imperfect all wealthy or all poverty stricken all highly educated or all illiterate perhaps they will be able to learn from each other superiority and inferiority must come from within a belief in ones self is the antidoteto the implantation of seeds of insecurity in many instances we are not as advanced in student government as other institutions but i am determined that were going to set up some kind of student government in which they the students handle all student discipline that does not stem from academic work this is not going to be wholeheartedly supported by all of the faculty but im going to get this approval i cant go any further with this kind of heavyhanded operation so im going to stop it james madison nabrit jr president of howard university had seemingly made his position clear in the interview carried in the washington post he reflected upon the gains of howards first years and the goals and aspirations that he had for the future the centennial year was over halfcompleted and for the most part the scheduled year long activities had progressed as planned seldom drawing more than small recognition in the daily papers less than three weeks later ronald o ross and leonard mccants both students and cochairmen of project awareness introduced the evenings guest speaker lt gen lewis b hershey of the selective service as the general began to speak a youth at the rear of the auditorium stood and yelled beast another screamed america is the black mans battleground at this point approximately students rushed to the stage waving signs saying america is the black mans battleground vietnam hell no and pictures of two hanging burned black men surrounded by a crowd of milling laughing whites the shock and bewilderment of the audience was visible evidence of their ignorance of the planned demonstration but perhaps even more important was the fact that over per cent of the audience cheered and applauded while the youths expressed their indignation and beliefs on the stage shortly after his assistance off the stage by the university police and administrators gen hershey in a classical stroke of paternal benevolence said i agree with the right to dissent but this is not the way to do it im a guest here but i dont criticize my host for what has happened that statement was published in all the papers what was not published at that time was the statement he also made that if you see a symbol of something that you are very much opposed to you take advantage of that symbol to protest it and i am a symbol i represent what these people are very much opposed to reactions were swift ronald ross one of the sponsors of the generals visit stated more of this type of reaction will occur until america solves its problem concerning the black man the other cosponsor was quotedas having said as a black person myself i found the entire affair repulsive the following day ernest goodman howards public relations director was quoted in the washington evening star as saying that only one of the demonstrators who surged onto the stage was identified as a student others he said were nonstudents known to be active in protest demonstrations in the washington area whether it is for civil_rights against the war in vietnam or what have you president nabrit mailed the general an official apology while in front of cramton auditorium a press conference was being held to announce the formation of the black_power committee dr nathan hare the oklahomaborn sociologist shared the reading of a prepared statement with huey labrie a freshman from oakland calif and robin gregory the pretty naturalhaired homecoming queen the committee they began has as its goals the overthrow of the negro college with white innards and to raise in its place a militant black university which will counteract the whitewashing black students now receive in negro and white institutions and at the same time responsible student leaders presented a statement to the press which stated that we decry and deplore the irresponsible premeditated and unforgivable manner in which gen hershey was treated and would like for it to be known that the manner in which these persons conducted themselves is in no way representative of the student community absent from the list of signatures was that of miss carolyn carter the editor of the hilltop the universitys student newspaper her comment the statement stinks on april four students including miss gregory the homecoming queen were scheduled to appear before a university disciplinary committee on charges stemming from the hershey demonstration in order to show their feelings about the hearings some or more students rallied and set fire to the hanging effigies of gen hershey pres nabrit and dean frank m snowden college of liberal arts after threatening to charge the committee room the dissenters regrouped on the campus and continued their rally the hearings were postponed for a later date one week later the faculty forum held a rally and charged the administration with three breeches of academic freedom denying students and faculty the use of campus institutions an unjust firing of a philosophy instructor and the kangaroo court trial of the students allegedly involved in the hershey affair the charge of denying the use of campus institutions was a result of the rescinding of permission to use cramton auditorium for a talk on vietnam by floyd mckissick the reason given for the rescinding order the facilities were overburdened during the centennial year keynote speakers at the rally were dr hare dr andress taylor of the english dept and prof ivan eames of the sociology dept unknown to anyone at that time all of these instructors would be fired within two months the following day about students forced their way past three doors and down a corridor with the intention of halting the rescheduled disciplinary hearings encouraged by students behind them they were only stopped by the locked door of the conference room the students called the hearings unfair and demanded that the charges be dropped or that the hearings be held in public the students refused to move until miss gregorys mother emerged from the conference room and stated that her daughter requested that they leave and allow her attorney to state his defense miss gregory came out and pleaded for compliance at which time jeroyd w jay greene a law student stated thats it brothers if she feels that she doesnt need or want our help then we have to respect her wishes to leave and they did jay greene was later to receive a letter stating that he would not be allowed to register in the fall almost daily rallies were being held in front of frederick douglass hall by the more vocal and militant members of the faculty and student body discussions and arguments ranged incessantly but the subjects seldom varied from black_power student autonomy the administration the draft and minister muhammad ali on saturday april rd dr hare the sociologist and former professional boxer addressed a nonuniversity authorized rally of people in front of douglass hall brothers and sisters he began it took the black_power committee to bring to howard university a man who is a better fighter and a better man than i am we who are gathered here today stand at the doorway of a new era of black pride and black selfassertion some men are born to lead us in this struggle one such man is muhammad ali the heavyweight champion of the world and minister of peace voicing the teachings of elijah muhammad proceeded to tell the sympathetic audience exactly why the black man is still catching hell the following week the university issued a point statement which protests must be confined outside the lecture hall and limited to orderly picketing a location shall be designated where students may conduct rallies at certain specified times the university shall not allow itself to be converted into either a recruiting place or a regular forum for advocates of any particular ideology discourtesy or incivility to guests visitors or members of the university shall not be permitted students and faculty may exercise their rights as citizens as individuals and not as representatives of the university a judiciary committee of students and faculty structured along the fundamentals of due process shall be maintained all public announcements and news releases shall be cleared through the public relations office arrangements to have representatives of the public communications media present on campus must be cleared by the public relations office all administrators faculty and students have a responsibility to abide by and support the above lawlessness and disorder shall not be permitted the university is dedicated to all races violations of any of the by the academic community shall be dealt with by the university in obvious disregard of the mandate the black_power committee held a press conference immediately after the announcement and a hilltop editorial called the attempt to turn the office of public relations into a censorship bureau the most outrageous of all student groups began to close ranks bridge differences and temporarily overlook ideological and political differences in their shaky but growing solidarity the student groups at howard range from the traditionally conservative social greek organizations and elected student government through the new student autonomyseeking students rights organization sro and the militant secret black_power committee continual charges of outside agitators were reminiscent of george wallace but nonetheless visitors from new york philadelphia newark watts and other black centers were constantly on campus often speaking before groups of students and faculty members between classes sometimes teaching sometimes learning but most often criticizing and encouraging in an offcampus meeting a group of students and faculty members were meeting to discuss what could and should be done in light of the administrations policy statement it was finally agreed to boycott but the problems that would have to be overcome for a successful boycott were staggering in order to be successful it was clear that over per cent of the student body would have to agree to stay out of classes how could a single program appeal to the black_power committee the sro the elected student government the greeks and the largest group of all at howard the nonaligned the committee agreed that if student demands were to be met it would be necessary to have at least one of the demands cover the needs of each student on campus on monday may jay greene told a gathering of some students that the boycott was a movement to free us from bonds that do not allow us to act as adults and as individuals the charismatic law student denounced the universitys paternalistic and totalitarian policies at that time greene stated that the campus chapter of the american association of university professors aaup went on record as supporting the student protests against the disciplinary proceedings surrounding the hershey incident greene predicted that the boycott would be per cent successful on the day preceding the boycott the university announced that threats on the life of president nabrit and other administration and faculty members had been received warning them to stay away from classes president nabrit was scheduled to be in new york on the day of the boycott honoring a long standing commitment to receive an award from brotherhood in action inc and to confer with a number of officials at a rally on the steps of douglass hall the boycott leaders stressed that doorways to all buildings would be picketed during the boycott but that there would be no interference with anyone attempting to attend classes on the morning of the boycott students living offcampus were met on their arrival by boycott committee workers with copies of the list of demands and a schedule of the days activities by this time the list had been revamped and compromised many times in order to draw the widest possible support the demands listed on the final draft were all charges against the four students allegedly taking part in the hershey incident be dropped as the university has no written code of conduct which they have violated a guarantee in writing that no action retroactively or prospectively be taken against any student because of his or her political activities during the current academic year abolishment of all senior comprehensive examinations since this university requires final exams in all courses and a minimum grade point average gpa of to graduate the senior comprehensive which is an additional exam raises an inference that final exams and gpas have no validity in determining the academic proficiency of prospective graduates that no faculty member be dismissed or denied promotion because of his political activism or nonconformity any university needs faculty members who espouse different or radical ideas because the academic growth of students depends upon exposure to different ideas and issues that compulsory rotc be abolished immediate repeal of the recent policy statement on student protest the policy as it now stands is totalitarian as well as paternalistic it is antithetical to academic freedom and is only an inducement to activist students to defy it thus it will tend to provoke demonstrations rather than accomplish its avowed purpose of curtailing demonstrations the signers included the student body president editor of the hilltop president of the liberal arts student council chairman of the sro chairman of the howard university student forum president of the interfraternity council and the black_power committee first on the agenda during the boycott was a faculty teachin in which the instructors spoke on any subject that pleased them it seems that the instructor who returned to microphone most often lectured on the absurdity of the boycott and the need for the students to return to their classes he was respectfully ignored a little later the record message to the grass roots by the late malcolm_x was played at eleven oclock a large contingent of law students marched from the law school to the university administration building with his back to the building william a blakely presidentelect of the student bar association faced a large crowd of students and read a petition opposing the policy statement that limited demonstrations over law students had signed the petition including jay greene and arthur goldberg these two students were among those to be felled by the dismissal axe during the summer recess the atmosphere surrounding their dismissals was itself puzzling goldberg more so than greene greene prized for his ability to rap as well as for his academic standing constantly insisted that the students demand autonomy over nonacademic functions and that they take greater pride in being black arthur goldberg was another matter also an excellent student it appears that his one mortal sin was that of reputation formerly a leader of student unrest at berkeley he frequently longed to take an active part in the growing student unrest at howard but goldberg a jew felt that howard as a black school should be lead out from under its present problems by black students at that time per cent of those students were staying out of their classes in the next few weeks all charges against miss gregory were dropped while the three young men were given written reprimands and deprived of the privilege of running for student offices during the next academic year almost as a prelude to the summers rebellious outbreaks across the country students and faculty members were stunned to discover early one morning that during the night someone or some group had spraypainted the words join the black guard in large black letters on the pillars of douglass hall along the side of the ira aldridge theater and on the side of an abandoned house harshly visible from the front of cramton auditorium a few days later fire department officials began investigating a series of suspicious blazes which had broken out on the campus students and faculty members were surprised to discover armed patrolmen and fire marshals in the corridors on each floor of the building the room in which i took one of my finals showed the result of one of those suspicious blazes the pulldown maps were little more than charred remains while that entire corner of the room was black every window in the room had cracked under the apparently intense heat if there was any doubt as to the seriousness of someones intentions it was eradicated while viewing the aftermath as i left the room i looked out the cracked windows at the recruitment appeal splattered on the wall a few hundred feet away join the black guard i wondered what would happen next during the fourth week of june i found out as many students had been predicting all along the university had waited until the summer and then fired five professors and expelled students the american civil liberties union aclu requested howard to reinstate the ousted students and faculty until they could be given a hearing the aclu board charged that the faculty had been dismissed and the students barred without due process for exercising freedom of speech the aclu threatened legal action if the university refused to hold a hearing the american association of university professors general secretary bestram davis sent a letter to the university asking howard to rescind its dismissal of five faculty members until they were accorded hearings the howard law alumni association of the greater washington area went on record as condemning the university andor interested parties responsible for the recent dismissal of students and faculty members without any semblance of administrative due process our condemnation flows from the fact that this unfair conduct is contrary to the historical role traditionally adhered to by howard university copies of the condemnation were sent to the board of trustees perhaps one of the most accurate gauges of student reaction was penned by law student taunya lovell banks in a letter to the editor of the washington post as a student i am fearful of the caliber of education i will receive in an atmosphere which openly and flagrantly stifles dissent and criticism i am both outraged and ashamed that my university has reacted in this distasteful manner because a courageous few sought to maintain through dissent the ideals once fostered by howard universityas an institution and as a composite of individuals on monday july president nabrit announced his desire to retire as soon as the board of trustees can find a successor in a statement issued through the office of public relations the president was quoted as saying emphatically that the unrest that has plagued the universitys campus during the past year did not influence his decision to retire at this time the report further stated that he was deeply distressed by the events of the past year as well as by the steps it became necessary for him to take in order to maintain law and order on the campus i was distressed too by the erroneous interpretation that some people gave to my actions intimating that i had deviated from my lifelong adherence to civil_rights civil liberties and freedom of speech the following day in a press conference president nabrit conceded that black_power on campus is all right until it disrupts the order that the process of education requires but when black_power attempts to make this a black institution it ceases to be a group in the civil_rights struggle and becomes an institution trying to set up control of howard this would result in the elimination of white members of the board the administration the faculty and the students i have fought all my life for integration and i do not propose to preside over this kind of thing at howard the type of thing that he is presiding over at howard at this time is similar to the growing nationwide demand of more student voice in student affairs howard however has an element that makes its case a particular one and that element is black_power the absolute refusal of the majority of campus organizations to allow their names to be used on any boycott literature that carried the slogan is proof enough of the controversial atmosphere surrounding it yet the majority of the campus black_power advocates were not members of the militant black_power committee these students believe that the greatest and perhaps the only prospect for improving the welfare of black people will have to be a collective political economic and social effort it will begin with the realization that none of the governmental programs in existence in this country today have lifted the level of life of the average black man it means realizing that if the government of the united states were to allot five states to black people tomorrow to set up a nation we would be bankrupt by the middle of next week because we are neither ready nor prepared to administrate it means that once the rebellions that raced across the country are over we are going to have to be prepared to help rebuild a nation of people either within the present governmental setup or in a completely new context it can and must be done but as students we are going to need room to grow to meet and to discuss when per cent of the student body boycotted last spring to show their desire for needed reforms their answer was a barrage of firings and dismissals it is not expected that that will be the end of student unrest dr hare has already turned down two offers at larger more richly endowed institutions while jay greene has refused an allexpense scholarship to the yale law school to remain here in washington and fight for his readmittance to howard the washington post in an editorial referred to the censureship clause of the university policy statement and called it not only objectionably paternalistic but unenforceable and unlikely to be obeyed commenting on the dismissal of the faculty members and expulsion of the students the editorial stated without offering any judgment as to the merits of these disciplinary decisions some of which are now being contested in the courts we are left with a strong impression that they were made arbitrarily without the elements of a fair hearing and in a manner certain to exacerbate unrest and anger on the campus this does not seem prudent policy in relation to a student body already seething it invites rebellion in the most cherished peaceful and nonviolent manner the students and faculty demonstrated their desires by boycotting classes and listing their reasons for doing so they were rebuked for their efforts but most tragic of all is the fact that the administration the students and the faculty all seek a greater howard unfortunately it still appears that the students and administration are on a collision course it is time to avert a needless but certain disaster postscript contrary to mr malsons wishes all did not go quietly and well when classes were resumed on september as president james m nabrit jr addressed the student body more than students and faculty members stalked out of cramton auditorium in protest against the universitys action in dismissing militant faculty members and expelling militant students outside the auditorium fired professor nathan hare spoke to the students and admonished them against listening to the lies of the university administration just put them out of business close them down because we are all domestic slaves mr hare is quoted as saying a suit challenging the dismissal of the students and the professors is pending in the united states court of appeals in washington d c a district court judge upheld the universitys action in the dismissals meanwhile dr nabrit has expressed some sympathy with the militants on the faculty and among the students he recognized that black people have grown tired of americas promises and that there is a spirit of revolt at work which will not be satisfied until a new order is established it is unfortunately true that negroes have not reaped the full harvest of their expectations africanamerican a y nationalism first came j into my life in j when i heard brother malcolm_x speak for the first time since that time it has become the dominant ideology in my life to me it includes all the various aspects of being part of a group culturally africanamerican nationalism demands that we as black people accept the fact that we have a distinctive and valuable cultural heritage which we must cherish nourish and pass along to our children it means that songs must be sung books must be written plays must be performedall extolling the rich and varied cultural heritage of our people africanamerican nationalism demands that the accepted criteria for beauty for worthiness for esthetic value be determined by us based upon what is good for us politically africanamerican nationalism demands that our community leaders be chosen solely by us based upon their contributions to the progress and security of the total group it demands that our leaders be representatives of our group to the larger community a representative is an integral part of the group from which he comes while an intermediator usually stresses his neutrality between two opposing forces africanamerican nationalism demands group solidarity not the kind of solidarity which totally suppresses internal dissent but the kind which instantly solidifies against any outside threat to the group this kind of nationalism operates under the principle may my people always be right but my people right or wrong it recognizes the fact that this country is based on racial religious and national groupings and that the individual progresses as his group progresses africanamerican nationalism rejects extreme groupdefeating individualism instead it stresses collective group action as the best means for promoting progress and security it judges events both nationally and internationally in terms of how they affect our group if it helps our people its good if not forget it it recognizes that just as a strong and stable family relationship helps the individual in his dealings with other groups africanamerican nationalism forms a solid base for effective political power for its allows us to form alliances from a position of strength with other groups whose interests coincide with ours on a particular issue it accepts the fact that power is what ultimately counts in relationships between groups just as it does in relationship between countries that is why we must develop group power in our constant struggle for survival and continuation as a distinctive people we have to remember another old but pertinent cliche we have no permanent friends permanent interests economically africanamerican nationalism demands that we use collective economic power wherever it is feasible as a means to improve our groups economic position the important word is collective the group must pool its economic resources in order to gain a most elementary positioneconomic control of our communities this collective power can be used in two ways first the small businesses such as grocery stores laundries clothing stores restaurants must be owned by black people on a collective basis second in areas which we dont own but in which we spend heavily we must use collective economic power to force changes which will benefit the total group this would entail wellplanned and wellcoordinated programs of boycotts selective buying and other such tactics africanamerican nationalism regards such programs as powerful weapons in the struggle for liberation educationally africanamerican nationalism demands that black people finance and support schools and centers which will be used to promote group identity among our children in these schools and centers the imagecreating process will be completely controlled by nationalistminded teachers authors artists and musicians who will use their talents to give the children the proper symbols and knowledge needed to maintain strong group identity history for instance will be taught as interpreted by trained and competent black historians in the already existing public schools africanamerican nationalism demands that black parents and black teachers use all means at their disposal to insure that the public schools in black communities are geared to the needs of the students of those communities internationally africanamerican nationalism demands that we attempt to create a sound working relationship with our counterparts in africa this relationship will be based not on a solely emotional basis but on a practical belief that the progress of the africanamerican will ultimately help the africans and that as brother malcolm once said a strong and united africa will be a protection for black people everywhere africanamerican nationalism demands that we give our wholehearted support to the true african nationalists who are fighting to gain control of their continent it demands that we promote the cause of african nationalism in this country we must judge international events in terms of how they affect the cause of african nationalism finally africanamerican nationalism accepts the principle that our future wellbeing has to be based upon a strong relationship with africa and friendship with that portion of the colored world which offers friendship to us africanamerican nationalism is slowly increasing in strength among our people the espousers of group identity racial consciousness and black_power are all expressing a form of nationalism africanamerican nationalism is an ideology umbrella under which the human resources of our people can be utilized to insure group stability group progress and group security to me africanamerican nationalism is our only sure path to liberation during the last decade coinciding with the explosion of negro civil_rights movements into public consciousnessa number of negro playwrights have gained considerable notice louis peterson lorraine hansberry ossie davis james baldwin leroi jones and others collectors of awards and honors a few catapulted into international fame and dramatic prominence critical barometers and geiger counters whipped out to gauge possible winds trends and resulting fallout however this flurry of attention has tended to misrepresent the real status of negro playwrights despite an eminent handful negro dramatists remain sparse in number productions sporadic at most and scripts too few to indicate discernible trends last year during a forum on what negro playwrights are saying not even panel members could cite enough plays to make plural subject matter viable moreover even when deemed successfulthe critical and financial rewards reaped by a raisin in the sun excepted and on a smaller scale leroi joness dutchman few productions have managed to recoup capitalization no the millenium has not been reached many factors contribute to this situation but surveying the total landscape of american theater results could hardly be otherwise the legitimate theater that fabulous invalid which compared to its electronic bedpartner is still dreamed of as the repository of high culture and artistic achievement in america hardly qualifies when examined from a negro viewpoint tirelessly predictably almost repetitiously on cue theater critics and other jeremiahs deplore rampant commercialism the monopoly of escapist musicals the dominance of brittle frothy comedies and the inadequacy of experimental ventures they also leave the impression that a little minor surgery would work wonders that palliatives could restore health but the patient is sicker than even the most pessimistic diagnosis suggests no matter how severe their prognosis pundits seldom question the basic structures or assumptions of their theater with rare exceptionsan occasional native play of quality or intermittent foreign infusions american legit theater even at its most ambitious seriousness is essentially a theater of the bourgeois by the bourgeois about the bourgeois and for the bourgeois a pretentious theater elevating the narrow preoccupations of restricted class interests to inflated universal significance tacitly assuming that its middleclass affluentoriented absorptions are central to the dominant human condition a theater rarely embracing broader frames of reference or more inclusive concerns a theatereven if it triedincapable of engaging the attention of anyone not so fortunate as to possess a college diploma or fivefigure salary more specifically a theater in its loftymodern niche broadway offbroadway offoffbroadway happeningsland whereveroverwhelmingly riddled with works of ingroup concerns belleslettres pomposity instant despair stultifying boredom humorless humor hastypudding hijinks pseudoabsurdity and closetavant daring a theater of diversiona diversionary theater whose main problem is not that its too safe but that it is surpassingly irrelevant occasional productions of stature and significance must usually display a cachet of foreign authorship and reputation to justify presentation maybe this is all as it should be computer consensusas yet doesnt spawn meaningful plays the most powerful country in the western world doesnt necessarily usher in a golden age of drama it is not surprising that the negro playwright and the power of his potential fits only peripherally into this spectrum by his mere historical placement in american society the negro exists as a disturbing presence an embarrassment to majority comfort an actuality deflating pretenses an implicit witness and cogent critic too immediate for attention also just as in real life a black playwrightsight unseen play unheard is soothsayed as too bothersome a prod to the sleeping conscience of numerical superiors the stage establishment like hollywood consigns even the most innocuous negro subject matter to an ogrecategory of problem drama even sympathetic advisers constantly bug the dark craftsman to shun racial themes and aspire to that pantheon of olympian universality which all white playwrights ironically enough can enter by merely getting themselves born as one naive wellmeaning but frighteningly boorish scribe put itno longer negro playwright just playwright whoever heard of batting an eyelash of lowercaste condescension when sean ocasey is mentioned as an irish playwright that the negro playwright is more or less excluded from legit boulevards is not a revelation for concern more important is the fact that even when produced within this environment the very essence of his creative function is jeopardized his plays by a majority least equipped to understand his intentions woefully apathetic or anesthetized to his experience often prone to distort his purpose spectators who though afflicted with selfimposed ignorance demand to be taught abcs at the very moment when the writer is impatient to explore the algebra of his thematic equations observers even when most sympathetic whose attitudes have been repeatedly shaped by preconceptions and misconceptions warped by superficial cliches and platitudesliberal conservative or radical though they may be catering to such insistences presages barren results with imagination shortcircuited valuable time is wasted clueing in exposition is demanded when action should be unfolding the obvious must be overillustrated and fantasy literalized finally when the curtain descends whether the writer has pampered illusions lectured ignorance comforted fears shouted for attention or flagellated consciences probability dictates his defeat and the victory of customerstriumphantly intact in their limitations with tears dried the shouting quieted or the aches of the catoninetails subsided the writer has been neatly appropriated usurped his creativity subvertedfor those negro playwrights eager to volunteer for this function theres no advice to offer they know the rules they play the game and take their chances but for a negro playwright committed to examining the contours contexts and depths of his experiences from an unfretted imaginative negro angle of vision the screaming need is for a sufficient audience of other negroes better informed through commonly shared experience to readily understand debate confirm or reject the truth or falsity of his creative explorations not necessarily an allblack audience to the exclusion of whites but for the playwright certainly his primary audience the first persons of his address potentially the most advanced the most responsive or most critical only through their initial and continuous participation can his intent and purpose be best perceived by others the validity of this premise has been borne out previously in other productions and most recently during the current run of my own plays happy ending and day of absence two works of satirical content written from an unapologetic negro viewpoint throughout the run negro attendance has averaged close to per cent hundreds witnessing a professional play for the first time besides contributing immeasurably to the longevity of the run the freshness of their response immediacy of in volvement and spontaneity of participation have significantly underscored the essence of the works themselves and provided crucial illuminations for others with negroes responding all around white spectators congenitally uneasy in the presence of negro satire at least cant fail to get the message any future hope for the negro playwright depends upon whether or not this minuscule singular alltoinfrequent experience can be extended multiplied and made permanent as long as the negro playwright remains totally dependent on existing outlets he stands to continue as a pauper begging sustenance never knowing from day to day year to year whether a few scraps will be tossed his way even burgeoning taxsupported privately endowed repertory companies are beyond the reach of his ambition imagine rushing to present day of absence or any other work which would require jobbingin negro actors when your roster only allows for two or three at mostoften tokens at that eventually an allembracing allencompassing theater of negro identity organized as an adjunct of some negro community might ideally solve the negro dramatists dilemma but such a development to memust arise as part of a massive effort to reconstruct the urban ghetto smallscale cultural islands in the midst of the ghettos separate and apart from a committed program of social and economic revitalization of slums are doomed to exotic isolation meanwhile potential talent ready for exercise cannot wait without engagement it lies dormant stillborn time passes aging proceeds the talent withers and eventually dies of nonuse if any hope outside of chance individual fortune exists for negro playwrights as a groupor for that matter negro actors and other theater craftsmenthe most immediate pressing practical absolutely minimally essential active first step is the development of a permanent negro repertory company of at least offbroadway size and dimension not in the future but now a theater evolving not out of negative need but positive potential better equipped to employ existing talents and spur the development of future ones a theater whose justification is not the gap it fills but the achievement it aspires towardno less high than any other comparable theater company of present or past world fame a theater concentrating primarily on themes of negro life but also resilient enough to incorporate and interpret the best of world dramawhatever the source a theater of permanence continuity and consistency providing the necessary home base for the negro artist to launch a campaign to win his ignored brothers and sisters as constant witnesses to his endeavors this is not a plea for either a segregated theater or a separatist one negroes constitute a numerical minority but negro experience from slavery to civil_rights has always been of crucial importance to americas existence theres no reason why whites could not participate in a theater dedicated to exploring and illuminating that experience if they found inspiration in the purpose also just as the intrusion of lower middleclass and workingclass voices reinvigorated polite effete english drama so might the negro a most potential agent of vitality infuse life into the moribund corpus of american theater one more river to cross by will henry is published by random house new york and sells for the subtitle is the life and legend of isom dart the author employs the biblical usage of changing a persons name after an extremely significant event occurs in his life ned huddleston is the name that this exslave uses through most of his life and he ends up being called isom dart this novel is ostensibly based on a western folk tale and the story is based on legendary events in the history of isom dart the notion of adding to the repertoire of american folk tales the story of a black man is an excellent idea certainly it is important to the american literary scene that this be done in that the main body of this countrys folklore displays a conspicuous absence of the contributions of the people of african ancestry parenthetically it would help if historians would stop camouflaging the racial origins of the many blacks who have made significant contributions and are disguised by these historians as white will henry has written a great many folk stories based on western legends and seems to know a great deal about living patterns in the west however he fails miserably in his attempt to portray isom dart as a heroic figure in fact a reading of this book makes one ask why he bothered to describe such a pitiful character his efforts are ludicrous when one realizes that he even intended to create a heroic figure maybe mr henry just could not believe the legend of isom dart as he has heard it and amended it to fit his own picture of a black man the author superficially portrays isom dart as a fierce and brave figure whose reputation strikes fear in the hearts of anyone who hears about him for miles around isom dart is realistically fearless and his horsemanship tracking and hunting ability is unequaled during the course of his life isom has to kill many mexicans and indians without any psychological problems however when confronted by an armed white southerner who disarms himself and whips isom with isoms whip all that mighty isom is able to do is to drop to his hands and knees not to strike back the white man left him there disdaining even to look back at him our hero isom stayed down once was not enough for our author there is a repeat performance in the last episode in the novel this time it is even better after tracking down a white man who has killed isoms beloved adopted halfbreed daughter and while facing the white villain with gun in hand it reads boy youre plain lucky the way things are now you understand me uncle im weary and wore down and i wont say it twice you go and get your horse and you get on him and you get the hell over the river yonder and you keep going rash the white man was not wearing a gun he waited upon the will of isom dart and waited but isom did not strike yes suh said the tall negro and turned away perhaps the authors basic problem can be traced to a statement made early in the story when isom then called ned is trying to plot his future course he recalls his childhood in his musing the author puts these words in his mind ned reared in kindness and treated decently all his boyhood life if will henry can conceive of a slave being treated kindly and decently then he is in bad shape as an author who intends to portray an authentic human being words like these cannot even be thought of when one is attempting to describe the tragic and despicable lot of a black slave of a white man in conclusion mr henry had better stick to writing about white heroes and leave the dramatization of blacks to blacks before he was killed in colombia last year the catholic priest camilo torres admonished his countrymen who at least in pose shared his religious affiliationthat not one of them who was not on the side of the people who was not in essence involved in the revolution against the rulers could rightly consider himself catholic i think while not attempting a definition of what catholic in fact is that the catholicism of camilo torres as an expression of his religion obtained a special relation to man as a being it was of course precisely that relationship to man that placed him at odds with and indeed made him an enemy of the state torres religion was the religion of john brown nat turner and malcolm_xand others whose destruction was essential to the prolongation of state over man but the religion of torres and i think this can be said empirically as well as sensed was not a religion shared by very many catholic priests in these united states thomas merton perhaps freedom from domination freedom to live ones own spiritual life freedom to seek the highest truth unabashed by any human pressure or any collective demand the ability to say ones own yes and ones own no and not merely to echo the yes and the no of state party corporation army or system this is inseparable from authentic religion writes trappist monk merton in conjectures of a guilty bystander doubleday commenting on his work merton tell us maybe the best way to characterize this book is to say that it consists of a series of sketches and meditations some poetic and literary others historical and even theological fitted together in a spontaneous informal philosophic scheme in such a way that they react upon each other the slightly erratic structure of the book with its five separate parts into which many of the authors conjectures could as easily have fallen into one parts as they did seemingly fall into another keeps pace with that statement but the value of mertons christian reflections is in no way lessened by the fact that one occasionally loses patiencethe title of his book is no abstractionwith the lack of continuity merton is among the truly educated men of our time not in the narrow american sense meaning one who in becoming technically efficient took from a few courses in the humanities a superficial familiarity that might be used not unlike playing the piano as a social grace that elan of love the frenchman gabon insisted must be aroused if education is to have purpose is alive in merton or closer to home kenneth b clark suggested in the american scholar that in the training of human beings we must find some way to give them the assurance to love the security to be kind and the intergrity required for a functional empathy did he say mankind needs not more bombs but more mertonsthis rare noncolored man in whom the western assumption to know gives way to the educational imperative to think thomas merton is free of the american madness a letter arrives from some woman in france a total stranger evidently an ardent catholic asks me for the prayers of the monks of gethsemani that america may at last start a nuclear crusade against russia and draw all the fearful pusillanimous western nations with her into it all this in the name of religion christian and serious we cannot stand it any longer she said i wonder that god can stand it no network would have broadcast the merton report on the evening of november it would have been too sane the country is undergoing a real emotional crisis all the more so as oswald suspected of shooting kennedy has now been shot himself by a superpatriot a curious impulsive type a nightclub owner the whole thing is so odd it is barely credible or seven days later the whole question of the kennedy assassination is extremely complex and obscure but now everybody wants it to be settled and settled it is all have agreed on the answer the general justice is satisfied one feels that all have wanted a solution at any price and have taken the first one that was at hand is it good enough the perceptive merton discovers even in the monastery the kind of power struggle over absurdities that make life on this planet a satire he notes that there are people playing politics over whether the hoods should be up or down when the monks are listening to reading in the refractory and other little proprieties that mean nothing it is a question says merton of who shall have the last word who is boss in the end this kind of nonsense produces luthers or would do so if we had anyone around capable of becoming a luther fortunately we are all too stupid or too lazy it was merton who said in his book seeds of destruction most of us are congenitally unable to think black and yet that is precisely what we must do before we can even hope to understand the crisis in which we find ourselves furthermore we do not bother really to listen to what the negro says because we assume that when the dialogue really begins he will already be thinking just like ourselves the white jesus weve known so well could never issue a conjecture this honest the negro is clearly invited to one response he has had untold reasons for hating the white man they are now being solidly compounded and confirmed even though he has nothing whatever to gain by violence he has also nothing to lose and violence will at least be one decisive way of saying what he thinks of white society the result is likely to be very unpleasant and the blame will rest squarely on the shoulders of white america with its emotional cultural and political immaturity and its pitiable refusal of insight merton who considers himself neither conservative nor an extreme progressive is a man who sees and feels a man in whom the pragmatic question of the politiciancan we winis at all times subjected to the poets questioncan we be more fully human one cannot in reviewing this book say that it is good or bad or great it is a joy it might be said of merton as truman nelson has written of thoreauwhose affinity to nature lives on in merton that he has come to realize that there is an exalted form of individualism which merges into universality and becomes one with it i am tempted to think writes merton rather introspectively that the complexities of our own cenobitic system hem one in with arbitrary fantasies keep one in an absurd corner for the sake of some obscure principle or other some point of ideology in such a case to do what is really right one has to go at it backward as if he were doing something else as the soulful sncc folks say cmon way from there babydavid lloren and promises to keep the southern conference for human welfare vanderbilt university press is a very exhaustive historical work that traces the most liberal efforts on the part of southerners to reform their society the author thomas a krueger went to great lengths to document this liberal group the southern conference for human welfare through its brief years of life it is interesting to note the lengths to which the conservative south was willing to go in order to preserve its way of life in terms of the obvious social problems in the south this group did relatively little to solve these problems it tried valiantly and maybe in years to come history will tell what it did accomplish but the outstanding message of this book is that this group apparently did relatively nothing it was labeled out of existence with such titles as communist and radical the only consistent following it seemed to have were negroes which as the author points out did not help its image it is a duplication of an old story white people apparently are not going to do what is right just because they feel they should and an appeal from this perspective is futile this work is clear and objective however the same question could have been asked of the southern conference for human welfare as could be asked of the author why bother a year ago dodd mead company published a book which received little notice but which should have considerable interest for those interested in black writers in general and in the harlem renaissance in particular the book was countee cullen and the negro renaissance by blanche e ferguson the book has characteristics of both a travelogue and a memoir much of the space is devoted to the poet cullens visit to europe and the holy land in the early twenties and of his long stay in paris under the auspices of a fellowship for the older generation there is the pleasure of recognition of the names and personalities who black and white influenced the black world in the period between the first world war and the end of the second one not many of the people remain alive today but a few of them doarna bontemps sterling a brown and saunders redding among them in a way countee cullen lived a gilded life in a gilded age his was not the hard brutal life endured by so many of his generation and he spent all of his life in the north for the younger generation the book provides an opportunity to gain an insight into a muchdiscussed and apparently overrated time the period the harlem renaissance however the young reader should be warned that the time and its people should be seen in the context of the world and history and should not be judged by todays yardstick the christian role in todays society by the right reverend monsignor george a kelley is published by random house and is priced at it is written by a man who has had a great many valuable experiences but it is like locking the barn after the horses have escaped the society that he calls todays sounds like society must have been at the turn of the century he symptomatically treats the issues of our culture his basic premise is that things are bad but he feels that if people would do what is right all of the problems will be alleviated for instance he very astutely describes the evils of segregation and discrimination however he sees the solution as arriving when white people stop doing mean things like that there is no prophetic proclamation that evil has its rewards he never deals with the question of the decay that these segregating people have already engendered he not only seems to be writing just to white people but he is also only writing to roman catholics his ideas are laced with roman catholic jargon and he very clearly assumes a double standard ordinary people behave one way while roman catholics another the book might more aptly have been titled the catholic role in yesterdays society a quote from the book that bears these ideas out a hundred years ago what the majority of the population thought did not affect catholics they were in a minority these catholics were able to lead good christian lives without concerning themselves with problems beyond their own communities by remaining in close relationship one with the other they could and did live good and holy lives were they indeed good and holy while they condoned slavery worked little children justified colonizing the world treated women like dogs etc the point is foolish to argue that people are different now from what they once were like is ridiculous the fact is that environmental conditions change and therefore the potential contributions of people during each era are different another anachronism in this work is that the author is utilizing four teenth century catechismal didacticism he tells people what they are supposed to do this attitude is revealed in the title he says the christian role when if he were aware of any of the theological developments of the twentieth century he surely would have titled his book the christians role there could not be only one christian role yet he because of his title and his book seems to believe just that unlike monsignor kelley many of us have never believed in this good christian culture that he fears we are dangerously close to losing to many of us it has been too long in dying so that maybe we can now build a brotherhood of this world not just of the roman catholic churchmacfadden books has published a cheap cents paperback student edition of africa in the united states which is very much a bargain the book is edited by vernon mckay who also contributed a chapter american interest in africa in an introduction to the book mr mckay writes that the symposium is designed to illustrate the rich plurality of american interests in africa and its future it does not tell the story of africa itself but focuses on the remarkable work of africa being done in the united states by thousands of americans through their government their civic organizations their schools and churches their philanthropic foundations their art museums and music centers and through other institutions to this end such articles are included as the image of africa in the united states by the late melville j herskovits african students in the united states by the house subcommittee on africa and us government programs on africa within the united states by fred l hadsel there is an interesting article on the influence of africans on american culture by john a davis former head of the american society of african culture dr davis comments on the historical alliances and associations between africans and afroamericans and makes some statements relative to the contemporary status of relationships between the two groups probably the most useful article in the book is adelaide cromwell hills consideration of african studies programs in the united states dr hill currently a research associate in the african studies program at smith college provides a reasonably comprehensive rundown on african studies programs which could serve admirably as a guide for anyone interested in such programs a buy well worth the money africans were great story tellers long before their first appearance in jamestown virginia in the rich and colorful history art and folklore of west africa the ancestral home of most afroamericans present evidence of this and more contrary to a misconception which still prevails the africans were familiar with literature and art for many years before their contact with the western world before the breaking up of the social structure of the west african states of ghana melle mali and songhay and the internal strife and chaos that made the slave trade possible the forefathers of the africans who eventually became slaves in the united states lived in a society where university life was fairly common and scholars were beheld with reverence there were in this ancestry rulers who expanded their kingdoms into empires great and magnificent armies whose physical dimensions dwarfed entire nations into submission generals who advanced the technique of military science scholars whose vision of life showed foresight and wisdom and priests who told of gods that were strong and kind to understand fully any aspect of afroamerican life one must realize that the black american is not without a cultural past though he was many generations removed from it before his achievements in american literature and art commanded any appreciable attention i have been referring to the african origin of afroamerican literature and history this preface is essential to every meaningful discussion of the role of the afroamerican in every major aspect of american life past and present before getting into the main body of this talk i want to make it clear that the black race did not come to the united states culturally emptyhanded i will elaborate very briefly on my statement to the effect that the forefathers of the africans who eventually became slaves in the united states once lived in a society where university life was fairly common and scholars were beheld with reverence during the period in west african historyfrom the early part of the fourteenth century to the time of the moorish invasion in the city of timbuktu with the university of sankore in the songhay empire was the intellectual center of africa black scholars were enjoying a renaissance that was known and respected throughout most of africa and in parts of europe at this period in african history the university of sankore at timbuktu was the educational capital of the western sudan in his book timbuktu the mysterious felix dubois gives us the following description of this period the scholars of timbuktu yielded in nothing to the saints in their sojourns in the foreign universities of fez tunis and cairo they astounded the most learned men of islam by their erudition that these negroes were on a level with the arabian savants is proved by the fact that they were installed as professors in morocco and egypt in contrast to this we find that the arabs were not always equal to the requirements of sankore i will speak of only one of the great black scholars referred to in the book by felix dubois ahmed baba was the last chancellor of the university of sankore he was one of the greatest african scholars of the late sixteenth century his life is a brilliant example of the range and depth of west african intellectual activity before the colonial era ahmed baba was the author of more than books nearly every one of these books had a different theme he was in timbuktu when it was invaded by the moroccans in and he was one of the first citizens to protest this occupation of his beloved home town ahmed baba along with other scholars was imprisoned and eventually exiled to morocco during his expatriation from timbuktu his collection of books one of the richest libraries of his day was lost now west africa entered a sad period of decline during the moorish occupation wreck and ruin became the order of the day when the europeans arrived in this part of africa and saw these conditions they assumed that nothing of order and value had ever existed in these countries this mistaken impression too often repeated has influenced the interpretation of african and afroamerican life in history for over years years negroes played an important part in american life history and culture long before our relationship to this country is as old as the country itself africans first came to the new world as explorers they participated in the exploratory expeditions of balboa the discoverer of the pacific and cortes the conqueror of mexico an african explorer helped to open up new mexico and arizona and prepared the way for the settlement of the southwest africans also accompanied french jesuit missionaries on their early travels through north america in the united states the art and literature of the negro people has had an economic origin much that is original in black american folklore or singular in negro spirituals and blues can be traced to the economic institution of slavery and its influence upon the negros soul after the initial poetical debut of jupiter hammon and phillis wheatley the main literary expression of the negro was the slave narrative one of the earliest of these narratives came from the pen of gustavas vassa an african from nigeria this was a time of great pamphleteering in the united states the free africans in the north and those who had escaped from slavery in the south made their mark upon this time and awakened the conscience of the nation their lack of formal educational attainments gave their narratives a strong and roughhewed truth more arresting than scholarship gustavas vassa established his reputation with an autobiography first printed in england vassa born in was kidnapped by slavers when he was years old and taken to america he was placed in service on a plantation in virginia eventually he was able to purchase his freedom he left the united states made his home in england and became active in the british antislavery movement in he presented a petition to parliament to abolish the slave trade his autobiography the interesting narrative of the life of gustavas vassa was an immediate success and had to be published in five editions at the time when slave ships were still transporting africans to the new world two th century negroes were writing and publishing works of poetry the first of these was jupiter hammon a slave in queens village long island in hammon published an evening thought salvation by christ with penitential cries in all probability this was the first poem published by an american negro his most remarkable work an address to the negroes of new york was published in jupiter hammon died in phillis wheatley like hammon was influenced by the religious forces of wesleywhitefield revival unlike hammon however she was a writer of unusual talent though born in africa she acquired in an uncredibly short time both the literary culture and the religion of her new england masters her writings reflect little of her race and much of the age in which she lived she was a new england poet of the third quarter of the th century and her poems reflected the poetic conventions of the boston puritans with whom she lived her fame continued long after her death in and she became one of the best known poets of new england another important body of literature came out of this period it is the literature of petition written by free black men in the north who were free in name only some of the early petitioners for justice were caribbeanamericans who saw their plight and the plight of the afroamericans as one and the a same in th century america two of the most outstanding fighters for liberty and justice were the west indiansprince hall and john b russwurm when prince hall came to the united states the nation was in turmoil the colonies were ablaze with indignation britain with a series of revenue acts had stoked the fires of colonial discontent in virginia patrick henry was speaking of liberty or death the cry no taxation without representation played on the nerve strings of the nation prince hall then a delicatelooking teenager often walked through the turbulent streets of boston an observer unobserved a few months before these hectic scenes he had arrived in the united states from his home in barbados where he was born about the son of an englishman and a free african woman he was in theory a free man but he knew that neither in boston nor in barbados were persons of african descent free in fact at once he questioned the sincerity of the vocal white patriots of boston it never seemed to have occurred to them that the announced principles motivating their action was stronger argument in favor of destroying the system of slavery the colonists held in servitude more than a half million human beings some of them white yet they engaged in the contradiction of going to war to support the theory that all men were created equal when prince hall arrived in boston that city was the center of the american slave trade most of the major leaders of revolutionary movement in fact were slaveholders or investors in slavesupported businesses hall like many other americans wondered what did these men mean by freedom the condition of the free black men as prince hall found them was not an enviable one emancipation brought neither freedom nor relief from the stigma of color they were still included with slaves indentured servants and indians in the slave codes discriminatory laws severely circumscribed their freedom of movement by prince hall saw little change in the condition of the blacks and though a freeman at least in theory he saw his people debased as though they were slaves still in bondage these things drove him to prepare himself for leadership among his people so through diligence and frugality he became a property owner thus establishing himself in the eyes of white people as well as the blacks but the ownership of property was not enough he still had to endure sneers and insults he went to school at night and later became a methodist preacher his church became the forum for his peoples grievances ten years after his arrival in boston he was the accepted leader of the black community in hall petitioned the massachusetts legislature protesting the kidnapping of free negroes this was a time when american patriots were engaged in a constitutional struggle for freedom they had proclaimed the inherent rights of all mankind to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness hall dared to remind them that the black men in the united states were human beings and as such were entitled to freedom and respect for their human personality prejudice made hall the father of african secret societies in the united states he is the father of what is now known as negro masonry hall first sought initiation into the white masonic lodge in boston but was turned down because of his color he then applied to the army lodge of an irish regiment his petition was favorably received on march hall and fourteen other black americans were initiated in lodge number when on march the british were forced to evacuate boston the army lodge gave prince hall and his colleagues a license to meet and function as a lodge thus on july african lodge no came into being this was the first lodge in masonry established in america for men of african descent the founding of the african lodge was one of prince halls greatest achievements it afforded the africans in the new england area a greater sense of security and contributed to a new spirit of unity among them halls interest did not end with the lodge he was deeply concerned with improving the lot of his people in other ways he sought to have schools established for the children of the free africans in massachusetts of prime importance is the fact that prince hall worked to secure respect for the personality of his people and also played a significant role in the downfall of the massachusetts slave trade he helped to prepare the groundwork for the freedom fighters of the th and th centuries whose continuing efforts have brought the black american closer to the goal of full citizenship the literature of petition was continued by men like david walker whose appeal an indictment of slavery was published in dynamic ministers like samuel ringgold ward and henry highland garnet joined the ranks of the petitioners at the time a journalist literature was being born frederick douglass the noblest of american black men of the th century was the leader of the journalist group he established the newspaper north star and later the magazine douglass monthly john b russwurm and samuel cornish founded the newspaper freedoms journal in in a third poet george moses horton published his book the hope of liberty in his second volume naked genius he expressed his antislavery convictions more clearly george moses horton was the first slave poet to openly protest his status throughout the early part of the m th century the slave narrative became a new form of american literary expression the best known of these slave narratives came from the pen of frederick douglass the foremost negro in the antislavery movement his first book was the narrative of the life of frederick douglass ten years later an improved and enlarged edition my bondage and my freedom was published his third autobiography life and times of frederick douglass was published in and enlarged in douglass fought for civil_rights and against lynching and the ku klux klan no abuse of justice escaped his attention and his wrath it was not until that an afroamerican writer emerged who was fully a master of the short story as a literary form this writer was charles w chesnutt chesnutt an ohioan by birth became a teacher in north carolina while still in his middle teens he studied the traditions and superstitions of the people that he taught and later made this material into the ingredient of his best short stories in august his short story the goophered grapevine appeared in the atlantic monthly this was the beginning of a series of stories which were later brought together in his first book the conjure woman the wife of his youth also appeared in the atlantic july and gave the title to his second volume the wife of his youth and other stories of the color line three more stories appeared later baxters procrustes in the atlantic june and the doll and mr taylors funeral in the crisis magazine april and aprilmay chesnutts novel did not measure up to the standards he had set with his short stories though they were all competently written in he was awarded the spingarn medal for his pioneer work as a literary artist depicting the life and struggle of americans of negro descent paul laurence dunbar a contemporary of charles w chesnutt made his reputation as a poet before extending his talent to short stories both dunbar and chesnutt very often used the same subject matter in their stories chesnutt was by far the better writer and his style and attitude differed radically from dunbars dunbars pleasant folk tales of traditionbound plantation black folk were more acceptable to a large white reading audience with preconceived ideas of negro characteristics in all fairness it must be said that dunbar did not cater to this audience in all of his stories in such stories as the tragedy at three forks the lynching of jube benson and the ordeal of mt hope he showed a deep concern and understanding of the more serious and troublesome aspects of afroamerican life collections of his stories are folks from dixie the strength of gideon in old plantation days and the heart of happy hollow only one of his novels the sport of the gods is mainly concerned with afroamerican characters chesnutt and dunbar in their day reached a larger general reading audience than any of the black writers who came before them the period of the slave narratives had passed yet the black writer was still an oddity and a stepchild in the eyes of most critics this attitude continued in a lessening degree throughout one of the richest and most productive periods in afroamerican writing in the united statesthe period called the negro renaissance the community of harlem was the center and spiritual godfather and midwife for this renaissance the cultural emancipation of the afroamerican that began before the first world war was now in full force the black writer discovered a new voice within himself and liked the sound of it the white writers who had been interpreting our life with an air of authority and a preponderance of error looked at last to the black writer for their next cue in short story collections like jean toomers cane and langston hughes the ways of white folks heretofore untreated aspects of afroamerican life were presented in an interesting manner that was unreal to some readers because it was new and so contrary to the stereotypes they had grown accustomed to in her book mules and men zora neal hurston presented a collection of folk tales and sketches that showed the close relationship between humor and tragedy in afroamerican life in doing this she also fulfilled the first requirement of all booksto entertain and guide the reader through an interesting experience that is worth the time and attention it takes to absorb it in other stories like the gilded six bits drenched in light and spunk another side of miss hurstons talent was shown in the midst of this renaissance two strong voices from the west indians were heard claude mckay in his books gingertown and banana bottom wrote of life in his jamaican homeland in a manner that debunked the travelogue exoticism usually attributed to negro life in the caribbean area before the publication of these books harlem and its inhabitants had already been the subject matter for a group of remarkable short stories by mckay and the inspira tion for his book home to harlem still the most famous novel ever written about that community in eric walrond a native of british guiana explored and presented another side of west indian life in his book tropic death a near classic in these naturalistic stories eric walrond concerns himself mostly with labor and living conditions in the panama canal zone where a diversity of people and ways of life meet and clash while each tries to survive at the expense of the other clear perception and strength of style enabled mr walrond to balance form and content in such a manner that the message was never intruded upon the unfolding of the stories rudolph fisher another bright star of the harlem literary renaissance was first a brilliant young doctor the new and light touch he brought to his stories of afroamerican life did not mar the serious aspect that was always present the message in his comic realism was more profound because he was skillful enough to weave it into the design of his stories without destroying any of their entertainment value his stories blades of steel the city of refuge and the promised land were published in the atlantic monthly high yaller appeared in the crisis magazine during the heyday of that publication and was later reprinted in the obrien anthology best short stories of unfortunately he died before all of his bright promise was fulfilled the harlem literary renaissance was studded with many names those already mentioned are only a few of the most outstanding during the period of this literary flowering among black writers harlem became the mecca the stimulating holy city drawing pilgrims from all over the country and from some places abroad talented authors playwrights painters and sculptors came forth eagerly showing their wares three men w e b du bois james weldon johnson and alain locke cast a guiding influence over this movement without becoming a part of the social climbing and pseudointellectual aspect of it w e b du bois by continuously challenging the old concepts and misinterpretations of afroamerican life gave enlightened new directions to a whole generation as editor of the crisis he introduced many new black writers and extended his helpful and disciplining hand when it was needed following the death of booker t washington and the decline of the booker t washington school of thought he became the spiritual father of the new black intelligentsia james weldon johnson moved from florida to new york his diversity of talent established his reputation long before the beginning of the new negro literary movement later as a participant in and historian of the movement he helped to appraise and preserve the best that came out of it in his books autobiography of an excolored man the book of a merican negro poetry black manhattan and along this way an autobiography james weldon johnson showed clearly that negro writers have made a distinct contribution to the literature of the united states his own creative talent made him one of the most able of these contributors alain locke is the writer who devoted the most time to the interpretation of the new negro literary movement and to afroamerican literature in general in he expanded the special t harlem issue of the magazine survey graphic which he edited into the anthology the new negro this book is a milestone and a guide to afroamerican thought literature and art in the middle twenties the objective of the volume to register the transformation of the inner and outer life of the negro in america that had so significantly taken place in the last few preceding years was ably achieved for many years mr lockes annual appraisal of books by and about negroes published in opportunity magazine was an eagerly awaited literary event early in the harlem literary renaissance period the black ghetto became an attraction for a varied assortment of white celebrities and just plain thrillseeking white people lost from their moorings some were insipid rebels defying the mores of their upbringing by associating with negroes on a socially equal level some were too rich to work not educated enough to teach and not holy enough to preach others were searching for the mythological noble savage the exotic negro these professional exotics were generally college educated negroes who had become estranged from their families and the environment of their upbringing they talked at length about the great books within them waiting to be written their white sponsors continued to subsidize them while they developed their latent talent of course the great books of these camp followers never got written and eventually their white sponsors realized that they were never going to writenot even a good letter ironically these sophisticates made a definite contribution to the period of the new negro literary renaissance in socially inclined company they proved that a black american could behave with as much attention to the details of social protocol as the best bred and richest white person in the country they could balance a cocktail glass with expertness behind their prem tense of being writers they were really actorsand rather good ones they were generally better informed than their white sponsors and could easily participate in a discussion of the writings of marcel proust in one minute and the music of ludwig von beethoven the next as social parasites they conducted themselves with a smoothness approaching an artistic accomplishment unknown to them their conduct had done much to eliminate one of the major prevailing stereotypes of afroamerican life and manners concurrently with the unfolding of this mildly funny comedy the greatest productive period in afroamerican literature continued the more serious and talented black writers were actually writing their books and getting them published opportunity magazine then edited by charles johnson and the crisis edited by w e b du bois were the major outlets for the new black writers opportunity short story contests provided a proving ground for a number of competent black writers among the prize winners were cecil blue john f matheus eugene gordon and marita bonner writers like walter white jessie fauset wallace thurman nella larsen george s schuyler sterling a brown and arna bontemps had already made their debut and were accepted into the circle of the matured the stock market collapse of marked the beginning of the depression and the end of the period known as the negro renaissance the exotic negro professional and otherwise became less exotic now that a hungry look was upon his face the numerous white sponsors and wellwishers who had begun to flock to harlem ten years before no longer had time or money to explore and marvel over harlem life many harlem residents lived and died in harlem during this period without once hearing of the famous literary movement that had flourished and declined within their midst it was not a mass movement it was a fad partly produced in harlem and partly imposed on harlem most of the writers associated with it would have written just as well at any other time in the intervening years between the end of the negro renaissance and the emergence of richard wright black writers of genuine talent continued to produce books of good caliber the lack of sponsorship and pampering had made them take serious stock of themselves and their intentions the crisis organ of the national association for the advancement of colored people and opportunity organ of the national urban league continued to furnish a publishing outlet for new black writers the general magazines published stories by black writers intermittently seemingly on a quota basis during this period writers like ralph ellison henry b jones marian minus ted poston lawrence d reddick and grace w thompkins published their first short stories in richard wrights first short story to receive any appreciable attention big boy leaves home appeared in the anthology the new caravan the ethics of living jim crow an autobiographical sketch was published in american stuff anthology of the federal writers project the next year in when his first book uncle toms children won a prize contest conducted by story magazine his talent received national attention with the publication of his phenomenally successful novel native son in a new era in afroamerican literature had begun here at last was a black writer who undeniably wrote considerably better than many of his white contemporaries as a short story craftsman he was the most accomplished black writer since charles w chesnutt after the emergence of richard wright the period of indulgence for negro writers was over hereafter black writers had to stand or fall by the same standards and judgments used to evaluate the work of white writers the era of the patronized and pampered black writer had at last come to an end the closing of this era may in the final analysis be the greatest contribution richard wright made to the status of negro writers and to negro literature when the united states entered the second world war the active negro writers like most other writers in the country turned their talents to some activity in relation to the war the first short stories of ann petry began to appear in the crisis the negro caravan the best anthology of negro literature since alain locke edited the new negro sixteen years before had already appeared with much new material chester b himes a dependable writer during the depression period managed to turn out a number of remarkable short stories while working in shipyards and war industries in california in he received a rosenwald fellowship to complete his first novel if he hollers let him go in frank yerby won an o henry memorial award for his excellent short story health card which had been published in harpers magazine a year before a new crop of postwar black writers was emerging in their stories they treated new aspects of afroamerican life or brought new insights to the old aspects principally they were good story tellers aside from any message they wanted to get across to their readers the weepy sociological propaganda stories so prevalent during the de pression era had had their day with the negro writer and all others there would still be protest stories but the protest would now have to meet the standards of living literature opportunity and the crisis once the proving ground for so many new black writers were no longer performing that much needed service the best of the new writers found acceptance in the general magazines among these are james baldwin lloyd brown arthur p davis owen dodson lance jeffers john o killens robert h lucas albert murray george e norford carl r offord john h robinson jr john caswell smith jr and mary e vroman with the rise of nationalism and independent states in africa and the rapid change of the status of the negro in the united states the material used by black writers and their treatment of it did of necessity reflect a breaking away from the old mooring among black writers the period of the s was the period of richard wright the period of the s was the period of james baldwin the now flourishing literary talent of james baldwin had no easy birth and he did not emerge overnight as some of his new discoverers would have you believe for years this talent was in incubation in the ghetto of harlem before he went to europe a decade ago in an attempt to discover the united states and how he and his people relate to it the book in which that discovery is portrayed the fire next time is a continuation of his search for place and definition baldwin more than any other writer of our times has succeeded in restoring the personal essay to its place as a form of creative literature from his narrow vantage point of personal grievance he has opened a window on the world he plays the role traditionally assigned to thinkers concerned with the improvement of human conditionsthat of alarmist he calls national attention to things in the society that need to be corrected and things that need to be celebrated when richard wright died in paris in a new generation of black writers partly influenced by him was beginning to explore as ralph ellison said the full range of american negro humanity in the short stories and novels of such writers as frank london brown william melvin kelly leroi jones paule marshall rosa guy and ernest j gaines both a new dimension and a new direction in writing is seen they have questioned and challenged all previous interpretations of afroamerican life in doing this they have created the basis for a new american literature the black writer and his people are now standing at the crossroads of history this is the black writers special vantage point and this is what makes the task and the mission of the black writer distinctly different from that of the white writer the black writer concerned with creating a work of art in a segregated society has a double task first he has to explain the society to himself and create his art while opposing that society second he cannot be honest with himself or his people without lending his support at least verbally to the making of a new society that respects the dignity of men the black writer must realize that his people are now entering the last phase of a transitional period between slavery and freedom it is time for the black writer tos draw upon the universal values in his peoples experience just as sean ocasey and sholem aleichem drew upon the universal values in the experiences of the irish and the jews in the next phase of afroamerican writing a literature of celebration must be created not a celebration of oppression but a celebration of survival in spite of it carrie mae her c mothers voice sound ed hurried as she en tered the sunless dim of the shack mans outsidemista bust willwants you to mind his chillen while his wifes way the girl looked up still frowning from the patchwork darning she was trying to perform on her brothers overalls all right mama itll mean money for them shoes you need honey the woman said gazing down at the bare crossed feet he said hed pay you a dollah guess ahd better git billy ray nother pair of these instead the girl sighed tossing the pants over a chair my its sure warm she rubbed her arms across her face the color of light brown cinnamon it was late july and hot carrie mae got off the cot and stretched flexing her arms high above her head she was tall for her fifteen years and already her young breasts were pointing sharply through the cotton dress spry your feet chile he acts in a hurry carrie mae went to the bureau mirror now only a jagged scar since billy rays ball had shattered it and quickly pinned her long black braids in a crown across her head where you going carrie mae billy ray whispered pushing his face through the window from outside to work bring me something hun he said excitedly forgetting to whisper this time maybe please carrie mae sara dont never bring me nuthing sister sara has to help mama buy food and pay the rent takes all she can git then smiling softly the girl reached out and rubbed his head if they got some candy laying round comon chile and quit fooling with that boy mama urged impatiently ah done tolt you that man acts in a powful hurry mama and the girl walked out onto the porch blinking in the brash sharp light the porch sagged deeply in the center where the boards were rottening faster than the others carrie mae stepped carefully walking gingerly down the steps mindful of not getting a rusty nail caught in her foot the man was waiting in the sun beside an old black ford coupe rustied by weather and streaked with the everlasting mississippi mud he was tall and lean trim looking in a keen edged way he wore khaki pants imprinted darkly down the sides from wiping sweaty hands his upper torso was bare showing a hairy suntanned chest almost her natural color a baseball cap jauntily brimmed his eyes pulled low shading a high bridged nose he was smoking and restlessly scraping the ground with his foot absently covering two already smoked butts with dust ahm ready suh she said coming beside him he wheeled quickly dropping the cigarette and stomping it with the others when he shoved his cap back she noticed his hair was a whitish blonde and his eyes were a pale blinding blue not seeming to register anything at all but still piercing sharply through her git in he muttered opening the door and sliding in on the drivers side she hesitated seeing the back seat was torn out and just the skeleton springs remained to prove it had once been there git in ah said he repeated roughly frowning impatiently at her she climbed in beside him and closed the door the car started off quickly jerking unevenly with each gear shift she kept her neck twisted smiling back at the two forms growing smaller and smaller and at the lopsided shack fading in the distance the man drove silently toward the main highway careening down the narrow dirt road steering with one hand as he fumbled in his trouser pocket and extracted a crumpled pack of camels with a small tarnished silver pocket lighter he applied flame to the cigarette inhaling deeply she huddled closer to the window trying to escape the smoke fumes but instead breathing in the dust from the road she felt perspiration begin to flow warmly down her body embarrassed she pushed her arms tightly against her sides hoping the gesture would stop the rivulets this was the first time she was to take care of his children and she didnt want him to think her unclean but it was so hot especially sitting on this side facing the sun the back road ended at the stop sign clumsily he scraped the gears his hand brushing her knee the road he turned on was paved and fringed with scattered old farm houses not far now he said interrupting the long silence narrowing his eyes at her he continued slowly ah hear you a pretty good babysitter carrie mae least thats what mista gordy says she smiled proudly mister gordy was rich and important and didnt let everybody keep his children ah takes care of mista gordys chillen the best way ah know how mista will mama always says if anythings worth doing its worth doing right he didnt say anymore just stared at the road cigarette hanging from his mouth his face appeared preoccupied immobile except for his squinting occasionally when smoke got in his eyes she wondered about his children their ages whether they were hard to keep or nice as the gordys pretty gal like you go to school he asked abruptly yes suh ahm in the seventh grade she was a little ashamed knowing she ought to be going to the county high school but when cotton picking time came the colored children had to work in the fields and school closed the cigarette was down to the mans lips now he threw it out the window and reached in his pocket again for the pack finding it empty he threw it out too the car reached the towns entrance and screeched to a stop at the red light when the light turned green his hand brushed her knee like before feeling hot and prickly to her flesh she moved without seeming to move closer to the door believing she was in the way as if he had forgotten the turn he wheeled the car roughly off the main highway to a dirt road amidst screeching brakes and burning rubber she was thrown against him her body touched the strong muscle of his arm which seemed to tighten at the contact and she caught the pungent sweaty odor of him mixed with a strange sour apple smell resembling the homemade wine mama served company at christmas time she slid quickly over in her corner hoping he wasnt mad halfexpecting a sharp rebuke white folks here didnt like colored to get too near them she knew that by the colored and white signs that were in town the signs their preacher said shouldnt be there anymorebut they were it was something for her to be sitting here on the front seat with him the reason she knew because there wasnt any back seat without looking directly at him she saw he was breathing hard his chest moving in and out like he had been running too fast he pressed harder on the gas and the car sped faster past the corn fields sweltering in the sun blaze and on until snarling brush weeds and tall cool trees took up where the fields ended finally he jerked to a stop in front of a decrepit white onestory frame house needing paint cardboard venetian blinds hung crookedly covering the front windows while faded green shutters sagged weakly from their hinges git out he said tautly as if something had caught in his throat he started up the pebbled path his naked brown back sweat glistening in the sun she followed slowly avoiding the decapitated doll whose face was inches away from the crushed body inside the living room was dimly obscured by the drawn blinds a greasy bacon smell permeated the housethe thick kind brought on from too hurried frying with the house closed the room was small burdened with a crushed red horse hair sofa matching chair and scarred walnut coffee table her eyes rested on a picture of a fat smiling stringy haired woman holding a baby while a small boy tugged at her dress christ the man breathed taking off his cap and throwing it on a chair its hottern hell but he made no effort to open the windows or doors he went through the narrow doorway into the kitchen from where she stood she could see him opening the icebox and taking out a bottle of beer she scarcely moved until he called comon out here soundlessly she went into the kitchen here the smell was stronger soiled dishes with coagulated yellow egg and hardened white grease stains were piled in the sink a babys high chair was beside the table freckled with dried pablum she felt the man watching her closely as he sucked thirstily on the beer cold sweat ran down the bottles sides the coldness made her more conscious of the heat and dust still peppering her throat she wanted a glass of water but custom and habit made her keep silent my wife didnt have no time to clean up before she left he said motioning she wondered if he expected her to if so maybe she could get more money aunt died in the city he went on flatly she felt rooted to the spot as perspiration dampened her face a surging inadequate wave swept over her causing her to feel young and unwittingly helpless some whites were peculiar and took their own gooddoing time about telling you what to do others like mama once said just thought you ought to know what they wanted done should she start with the dishes and where were the children she listened hard thinking maybe they were asleep or outside playing but there were no visible sounds except for a birds lonely chirpno sounds at all you know carrie mae youre twice as goodlooking as theyre saying in town he commented eyes travelling slowly over her face and down to pause at the sprouting breasts like pointed cones the way he said it mouth barely moving tongue moistening his lips made an alien hotness aside from the rooms heat envelop her she stared childishly wideeyed questioning straining for any sound beside the birds mocking chirp finishing the beer he tossed the bottle in the filled can near the sink seeing her unconsciously follow the movement he smiled thinly want one astonished she shook her head she had never tasted beer before but maybe she should have said yes since he was white maybe he was going to get mad because she didnt or could be testing her to see if she was dependable a hundred shuttering maybes tore through her just one aint gonna hurt he laughed leaning back against the sink its nice n cold n gives you a real nice feeling ah dont drink beer mista will his face took on a pretended surprise you mean you aint never sat in that niggrah beer garden in town on satday night numbly her head moved slowly from side to side of course she had never sat in that beer garden why mama would die she could see mama now on saturdays when they went into town to shop how mama pinched lipped would drag her quickly by the place noisily thumping out music and loose laughter while beer and whiskey smells floated out and tainted the air aw comon now carrie mae he said voice lowering intimately now ah just know pretty you are you sneak there with boys sometimes dont you no suh she denied shaking her head never well where do you go with the boys the questions bewildered her she couldnt understand them or why this white man would even bother to ask her such things she saw his eyes were strangely aflame blazing with a queer brittle light reminding her of a mirror throwing out a sun glaze ah dont go nowheres with no boys mista will mama say ahm too young to keep compny water was running down her face freely now she wished he would stop asking all those things and tell her what to do and she wished he would let some air in the closeness seemed to be affecting him too for sweat was lacing his face and chest he didnt seem to mind it though standing there arms folded lounging back on the sink watching her yeah he murmured tightly you suren hell pretty as they say she didnt know whether to feel good about what he was saying or not and were those they the white men who loafed by the pool hall smirking and saying nasty things to the colored girls going by she was puzzled and didnt say anything comere she stiffened a constriction gathering in her chest comere ah said he straightened up tensing himself on the balls of his feet a knot worked in his jaws when his eyes moved to her breast again dont be scared ah aint going to hurt you she walked stiffly toward him her eyes fearful closer she could smell the beer she stopped warily not too close not too far away enough to show the white man she had obeyed suddenly his arms reached out and snatched her against him her nose was pushed into the brush thicket of his chest as his arms imprisoned her relax now he said arms entombing her body like ah said ah aint gonna hurt you just thought we twod have a little fun mista will she began eyes enlarged in terror ahm sppose to keep your chillen suh you said you wanted me to keep your chillen he was breathing harshly now like in the car and his face had a funny queer look like he hadnt heard or couldnt an electric quiver trembled his body as his hand encircled her breast jesusss christ he mumbled pressing his body hard against her squeezing the jutting softness comon carrie mae loosen up ah know you done this before out in the bushes colored girl your age always has we both kin feel real fine together aint nobody gonna know nobody here but us nobody here he laughed easily thinking her surprise relief hell naw wife done took the kids with her yesditty ah got lonely out here in these woods by myself got to laying wake last night remembering how pretty the boys said you were damned if they didnt describe you to a t a frightened knowingness washed away all the silent questions besieging her panic flooded her rising through and up to her throat exposing itself in one raw cry no she beat against him attempting to break away what this white man wanted wasnt right even if he was white it wasnt right please suh let me go help shut up damnit cant nobody hear you no way shut up ah said his hand slapped her hard causing her head and senses to spin for a moment she leaned weakly against him fighting the foaming black dizziness then his hand felt downward between her legs shock ripped through her she lashed out bringing her knee up in a swift blow he grunted halfbending dropping his arms to grab himself when he did she broke away scrambling to the back door the door was locked panicstricken she turned quickly measuring the distance between him and the passage to the front door in a flash she streaked wildly by him knocking over the high chair pain stabbed her knees his arm shot out catching the back of her dress she gave a muffled animal cry as she broke from his grasp dress tearing in his hand she reached the front door frantically jerking it open comon back here ah said comon back she ran and ran and ran until the words were not even an echo mama was sitting on the front porch when she reached the cabin breathlessly she stumbled up the steps falling at mamas feet and dropping her head in mamas lap chilechilewhats the matter she felt the large warm arms enfolding her and it seemed a long time until she could get her breath before she could tell when she finished mama kept saying nochillennochillen in a singsong kind of way suddenly like the devil had been let loose mama jumped up exclaiming loudly we going to the pollice billy ray ran from around the house looking questioningly at them pollice what for you going to the pollice mind your bizness billy ray mama retorted shoving him aside the boy slyly lowered his lashes at carrie mae did you git my candy carrie mae shut up boy mama said thats all you think about your stomick her eyes fell upon the girl again looking at her face bruised and swollen and at her feet blistered and powdered with dust angry pain flashed in her face lets go chile she said low put this safety pin back of your dress we going just like this and show the pollice what that man tried to do billy ray you stay here til sara gits home ah wanna go ah wanna go the boy screeched jumping up and down now you keep quiet ah said stay here whimpering the boy edged sulkily into the house the law ought to take care of him for sure mama mumbled why he want to be messin round with young girls mamas voice grew indistinct and carrie mae couldnt hear the rest as they started toward the road a man in a pickup truck gave them a ride to town they tried to ignore his curious glances and outspoken what happened when mama asked to be let out at the courthouse wearily they began to climb the twenty narrow concrete steps to the big stone building housing the courthouse sheriffs office and jail there was a landing between the tenth and eleventh stepsa wide concrete platform supporting a statue of a confederate soldier a cool drinking fountain was in front of the soldier with a white only sign crudely printed attached to it they paused breathing heavily from the climb and heat beside the white only fountain mamas huge bosom rose and fell like a heaving wave then after a while she took hold of the girl and they began once again the climb the sheriff was moonfaced and needed a shave his obese form was sprawled carelessly behind a desk cluttered with papers pencils empty coke bottles and filled ash trays a large poster was framed behind him showing an american flag waving in a blue background with big black letters printed on it reading liberty and justice for all the sheriff scared carrie mae the way his flabby jaws worked in monotonous rhythm as he chewed tobacco and the way his small eyes glared stonily unblinking at them but he didnt seem to scare mama when he growled yeah whatdoyouwant mama spoke right up so distressed that the words tumbled out ahead of each other all right all right auntie take your time he interrupted fumbling through papers now he squinted at an official looking form whats your name lillie henry suh where you live lillie just outside town on mista tom wrights land suh whats her name he asked glancing briefly at carrie mae carrie mae suh hummm the pen stopped its scratching sound leaving a brief silence between them now lillie he began again frowning you say a man tried to assault this girl suh mama asked puzzled by the way he chewed his words with the tobacco ah said you say a man tried to git at this girl he snapped impatiently mama looked at carrie mae who stood motionless with her head down thats right mista sheriff she replied leaning over the desk in her anxiety he said he wanted her to mind his chillen while his wifes away but his wife and chillen were gone werent nobody there but him all the time sure damn looks like somebody tried to do something he snorted laughing this nigger live in town mama stared gravely watching him playing with the pen this wasnt no cullurd man mista sheriff this was a white man the sheriffs jaws abruptly stopped their grinding leaving the small pink lips slightly ajar for the first time he looked directly at her you mean to stand there and tell me a whiite man tried to rape her mama nodded shaking her head emphatically thats right suh mista bust will he came but before she could finish the sheriffs voice rose harshly waitaminute he was standing now face fiery red his bulbous stomach breathing like a separate entity hanging over his belt aint no nigger coming in mah office with any old accusashon like that aint a whiite man in this town whod even bother with any old nigger gal moving uncannily fast for his size he bridged the space around his desk with lightning speed trying to blame a niggers dirt on a whiite man now git outta mah office before ah put both your black asses in mah jail mama stood stark still mouth jarred loosely like she didnt understand or didnt want to understand what he was saying nigger he said dangerously even you hear what ah said clutching the girls hand mama moved out of the office feeling his eyes blazing through their backs hotter than the sun had been without a word they went dully down the twenty narrow concrete steps not pausing this time beside the confederate soldier and the white only fountain mamas hand squeezed painfully around hers like she was afraid the girl would disappear or like she needed something to hold on to bad they walked slowly through the town and on out to where the highway began oblivious to the town with its scattered knots of people and the ancient unmovable town scenes they were halfway down the road when the girl made a strangling sound and began to cry mama stopped and watched her face heavy and still the girls thin body shuddered as the sobs racked her body then after a long while ever so gently mama took her big apron and wiped the girls face hush chile hush she murmured softly aint no use in crying now aint no use the girl kept her face hidden in the aprons curtain smelling the aprons freshness and needing the aprons shelter finally the sobs subsided under the whispering kindness of the voice and the smooth familiar caress of the womans hand silent moments later mama pushed her gently away the girl watched her stare for a timeless eternity at the fading sky seeing mamas lips move ever so slightly like they did when she prayed in church on sunday then mamas hand reached for hers again and together they started slowly down the road home youre leaving f txt yes she said youre leaving me no n no leavins you

window he stood watching snow flakes flutter in the cold breeze he stood watching the snow flakes flutter and cover the blank stone spaces of the rooftops below and after awhile he returned to bed ill tell you how much more he began and fell silent she was snoring softly he covered her gently not wishing to wake her we are all let us face it mississippians we all fervently wish that the negro problem did not exist or that if it must exist it could be ignored confronted with the howling need for decent schools jobs housing and all the other minimum rights of the american system we will do our best in a halfhearted way to correct old wrongs the hand may be extended grudgingly and patronizingly but anyone who rejects that hand rejects his own best interests for minimum rights are the only rights that we are willing to guarantee and above those minimum rights there is and will continue to be a vast area of discrimination and inequity and unfairness the area in which we claim the most basic right of allthe right to be stupid and prejudiced the right to make mistakes the right to be less and worse than we pretend the right to be ourselves when this majority right is threatened the majority will react accordinglywith results that could be disastrous to all of us from the editorial a new white backlash in the september saturday evening post black_power has claimed its first two victims they are vice president hubert humphrey and roy wilkins executive secretary of the naacp both men honored veterans of the civil_rights movement succumbed temporarily at least to the most ancient of maladies the inability to adjust to a new idea we find nothing subversive in sncc chairman stokely carmichaels remarks on the contrary this type of thinking is both practical and traditionally american nor should the older generation of civil_rights leaders object to the young negroes wanting to run their own show with white men supporting rather than dominating the various organizations this should be interpreted as a sign of maturity it means that negroes having won their le gal rights under the old system now are ready to work toward their goals under their own leadership like any other minority this too is traditional american history does not show that the irish were content to be led by yankees or that working men were content to be led by their employers in short we are suggesting that the older generation of civil_rights leaders avoid the mistakes of hubert humphrey and roy wilkins and resist the urge to panic at the sound of black_power we suggest that the older civil_rights generation reexamine this new concept of direct action and concentrate on the more thoughtful speeches of black_power advocates these young men are surprisingly realistic and are fully aware of both their caabilities and their limitations and ike it or not they are destined to be the doers of the new era of civil_rights whether they do good or evil depends in part on whether their predecessors encourage or repress themfrom the boston herald july the countrys newspaper proprietors the vast majority enjoying a monopoly preside over an institution that should be the most sensitive detector of change in society but among major american institutions newspapers have been the least responsive to upheavals in civilization since world war ii government education religion and much of corporate life have adapted to altered conditions in economic and social life but newspaper owners have clung to the past they seem to be reminded of their special status under the first amendment only when someone suggests changes in the secondclass mailing privilege or the payment of standard wages to delivery boys their response to the nation of the press being accountable to the public is to bar reporters from sessions of the american newspaper publishers association in addition the dangers of news monopoly are increasing from houstons shackled press by ben h bagdikian in the august atlantic behind the nondebate is a very real crisis in the movement which is more precisely a crisis in american life the dream of an integrated national community is about over all the dreamstuffthe assumptions about a mobile pluralistic egalitarian societyseems to be vanishing the country has responded to negro demands over the past decade primarily by eliminating the symbols of southern feudalism legal segregation disenfranchisement official brutality otherwise there have been few changes in american institutions the economy still excludes the underclass of poor negroes from productive employment the naacp is the traditional home of the small negro middleclass its president is white and jewish its director roy wilkins is the grin on the democratic

an eightyear old negro a girl flipped the pages of her new third y grade social studies book as she came to the last page she seemed puzzled she reread the books cover and began a more deliberate inspection of its contents after scanning the book a second time the littli girl raised her hand and asked her teacher where am in this book undoubtedly a similar question has run across the minds of millions of nearo vounasters from whence have i come in americas history and who am i and where do i fit in american society this is not a new feeling seventysix years ago edward a johnson noted nearo historian and educator wrote of how the little colored child feels when he has completed the assigned course of united states history and in it found not one word of credit not one word of favorable comment tor even one among the millions of his foreparents who have lived through nearly three centuries of his countrys history the unfortunate and tragic fact is that generations of negro children have grown up with a warped attitude toward themselves their parents and grandparents inside the american classroom they have not found anything to give them a sense of dignity and selfworth they have searched vainly through pure white books for some positive recognition of their races contribution to the civilization of man outside the classroom these negro youngsters and their parents have been subjected to the severe hardships the unending frustrations and humiliations of discrimination and segregation they have become a people robbed of their rich history and culture by historians through omissions neglect and the perputation of racial stereotypes and myths this has been a great american tragedy we have no way of knowing how many negro youths have become frustrated discouraged and bitter over their feeling of nobodyness we have no way of knowing how many potential negro scientists scholars doctors teachers and businessmen have been swept into the ditch of oblivion by the psychological backlash from the negro history gap dr charles h wesley educator author and historian who cur rently serves as executive director of the association for the study of negro life and history has written history is not the story of men and women of one race or color and the neglect and omission of the men and women of another race and color it is neither the glorification of white people nor black people but it is the story of people irrespective of race or color it should deal with people in all times and places and should present the contribution of all the people to civilization when a part of the people has been neglected or given subordinate places history in order to be truthful must be reconstructed i agree with dr wesley let us reconstruct american history as it really happened let the full facts be known the real story told of the remarkable contributions of negroes to americas growth and greatness let all our children negro and white learn the complete history of our country let them learn that negroes were here as far back as the days when columbus discovered the western hemisphere that negroes accompanied the spanish and portuguese explorers of the new world negroes were among the settlers who founded los angeles explorer jean baptiste point du sable a frencheducated negro trader founded our countrys second citychicago in surveyor benjamin banneker helped major pierre p enfant plan and lay out the city of washington inventor elijah mccoy devised the selflubricating machine matthew henson was the first man to set foot on the north pole minutes ahead of his chief admiral perry let our boys and girls learn about slavepoetess phillis wheatley who began the tradition of negro literature in america about frederick douglass a great american orator and statesman who played a significant role in the outcome of the civil war let the education of both youths and adults include proper recognition of the nameless black masses whose toil helped build american cities let all of us understand and appreciate the true role of the negro in this countrys struggle for freedom and justice let every american know that the very first man to lose his life in the cause of american independence was crispus attucks shot down by the british in the boston massacre of five thousand negroes fought in the forces of general george washington in our war for independence gave their lives to the north from among in the union armies and navy negro troops charged up san juan hill with teddy roosevelts rough riders they fought and died for their country in world wars i and ii throughout the truth of negro history runs a nobility in the face of adversity an epic faith over pain and travail a courage which exalts character the negros past is americas past as is his present and future he is an integral part of the warp and woof of the varied american fabric america has made a start in closing its history gao but much work remains to be done in recent years boards of edu m cation have written and published their own supplementary texts on negro history some textbook publishers have revised and updated their materials on the negro in american history professional organizations in recent months have sponsored national conferences on the treatment of minorities in textbooks this is a good beginning all segments of our society must work together in bridging our history gap for the shared pride in negro history and achievement is a solid foundation upon which to build a new and healthy climate of mutual respect and understanding among all elements of society in the words of frederick douglass this is a time when the american people are once more being urged to do from necessity what they should have done from a sense of right and of sound w statesmanship arter g woodc son was always so full of new ideas that he had no need to repeat himself yet on many occasionsespecially at the saturday sessions of the annual meeting of the association for the study of negro life and history when school teachers were present he would make a statement that went something like this it will be a great day for the association and for the study of american history when it will no longer be necessary to direct special attention to the fact that the negro has always been a part of american history he would then go on to say that the purpose of negro history week was to promote the history negro to the history week longer be necessary year in and year out dr woodson worked diligently to promote a new american history that would reject the notion that the negro had no history or that he should be treated in some special way no one was a more vigorous protagonist of the idea that the history of the united states should be completely integrated no one did more to point out the fallacies and inaccuracies of works in history assumed that the negro had no place in such works no single person did more to promote a new american historya democratic equalitarian american historyas far as racial and ethnic groups are concerned happily dr woodson lived long enough to witness the feeble beginnings of a new american history that accepted his ideas and premises but his wildest dreamsand he did dreamcould not have visualized what would happen in this area in the years following his death today heightened interest on the part of americans in discovering a new and more accurate place for the negro in american life and history is the result of the operation of a number of factors and forces it was interestingly enough stimulated by the legal fight for equality that began in earnest during the postwar years in the united states supreme court drew attention to the question of the history of the negro in american life by inquiring into the intent of the framers of the fourteenth amendment did they intend that the amendment should prevent segregated schools and other forms of segregation immediately lawyers and their consultants in the field of history scurried to the libraries and archives and began to pen lengthy and learned treatises on the activities of negroes during the reconstruction the programs and motives of their protagonists and the abortions performed on the fourteenth amendment by its wouldbe subverted it was a part of the general search for a broader and deeper meaning of the american experience brought on in part by the wartime effort to articulate a democratic ideology and in part by the postwar search for moral stability the search sent historians in a dozen different directions and they wrote on such diverse subjects as the american political tradition the image of man in america and faith of our fathers one historian emphasizing the transitory nature of some of our institutions and the recency of some others argued successfully that the legal institution of segregation was not nearly as old as the myth would have us believe perhaps most of all the search for a new american history was a direct consequence of the generationlong persistence of woodson his associates and the slowly increasing number of adherents to the view that american history as it had been taught and written in the past was tragically and deplorably incomplete thus it was not unlike the history of the civil_rights movement of a later date those who came to embrace the civil_rights movement did not invent it although some thought they did they merely discovered it those who began to think about american history and write about it in a new dimension did not invent it although some thought they did they merely discovered it as they searched among the heap of revisionist historical writings and suggestions for new approaches that had been ignored and disregarded for many years by the main body of american historians it was a most rewarding discovery made even more rewarding by a new willingness to discover new truths even if it called for a revision of longheld highly regarded views it made possible a new appraisal of ancient african cultures for which dr woodson had called in his african background outlined it facilitated a new look at the conditions among negroes before the civil war which dr woodson had helped to illuminate in his education of the negro prior to a score of other areas came to the attention of those who sought to fill the gaps in the history of american life the role of negroes during the civil war the complex relationships of freedom to the social order during reconstruction the intellectual response of negroes to postreconstruction degradation and the economic and political meaning of the color line in the twentieth century the veritable spate of books and articles that have come from the writers of the new american history in the past years has inevitably resulted in the massing of a great body of new facts and the projection of many new interpretations but the discovery has only just begun anyone familiar with the old american history knows all too well that we must yet fill innumerable gaps about such matters as the colonial negro the negro artisan the negro abolitionist the negro in the early days of organized labor and even the negro in congress but it is equally clear that the logjam created by silence or distortion has been broken and that in time more gaps will be filled they will be filled by those who present the results of their diligent research at the annual meetings of the association for the study of negro life and history the southern historical association the american historical association the organization of american historians and numerous other historical societies it seems almost unnecessary to remark that all historical activities today do not necessarily contribute to the new american history some historians whose writings reflect both diligence and zeal resist new interpretations with a vigor that is similar to the vigor of those in other areas who seek to keep inviolate the old order others more subtle and if i may say so more sinister work assiduously to discover new materials only to use them to reflect unfavorably on the very idea of a new american history still others opportunists pure and simple and frequently merely pseudohistorians at best seize the opportunity presented by a more congenial climate to write or more properly to slap together somethinganythingon the negro these opportunists see the ready market and they would not miss it for the world their interest is not new american history but new american dollars one can only say that the reader nay the buyer beware neither the antagonists nor the opportunists can stem the tide that has set in although they can perhaps delay it or subvert it we move nevertheless inexorably toward a condition in our study of american history where it is possible to reexamine the total american past and on the basis of that reexamination we can write a new synthesis of the american experience this is not to imply that such a work should have an air of finality about it indeed it would be better if it emphasized the tentative nature of its findings and interpretations for example we already know a great deal about reconstruction we know that the night was not as long or as dark as we have been told and we can prove it but we yet have much to learn about what actually happened during the socalled night of reconstruction and we have much to learn about who kept it from being so dark or so long and how they did it in other words the very spirit of the new american history is one of revisionism and one of the most important things that the revisionist spirit does is to recognize the possibility of further modification as well as greater precision and refinement even when the materials are readily available the writing of a new american history is no easy task first of all it calls on the writer to make certain assumptions that are in keeping with the underlying forces in american history among them is the assumption that american history is not the success story of white anglosaxon protestants who as the story goes made this country strong and great against all odds rather the history of the united states is the story of a joint enterprise with various groups and individuals playing certain roles either taken by them or assigned to them the roles they have played however exalted or however humble have been important in the making of america secondly it rejects the notion that the history of the united states is merely an exercise to inspire blind loyalty and patriotism this is not to say that the new american history should set out to undermine devotion to country that would be a tragic mistake it is to say however that a healthy devotion to country must rest on a clear understanding of what actually happened and not on some fantasy of what should have happened any american history worth writing or worth studying recognizes the fact that this land was peopled from the beginning with ordinary human beingsvery fallible human beings they made mistakes many mistakes and they were wrongheaded in many ways it is unfortunate that the colonists did not want negroes in the continental army but the fact is that they did not it is a sad commentary on the use of the natural rights philosophy that the continental congress would not permit the condemnation of slavery in the declaration of independence but the fact is that it would not it is tragic that for more than years the united states would not recognize haiti because it was a black nation but that is an undeniable fact it is not pleasant to discover that the entire american experience is suffused with certain doctrines of racism that have at times been decisive in determining the course of american history but who can deny this after studying the history of the ideology of white supremacy in the united states that has justified slavery segregation discrimination and degradation the lesson that the new american history teaches is that only by a critical realistic appraisal of the past can we understand the roots of the difficulties that plague the nation today otherwise we will be like the master who in describing his runaway slave as one with whelps and gashes on his back then commented sardonically that he could not possibly understand why the slave ran away it should be added that the new american history requires a sense of balance and proportion that may be easily upset by the zeal that comes from the effort to redress the balance in reassessing the negros role in american history to give an absurd example one must not insist that crispus attucks was the central figure in the war of independence he died five years before it began in restating the negros valiant resistance to slavery one must not insist that every slaveowner had his brutus or his nat turner it is well to remember that most slaveowners had one or two slaves and they were in no position to mount a large scale conspiracy it is indeed remarkable if a given generation of oppressed restrained degraded people cc produce one nat turner it derstandable that some inose who have suffered from centuries of almost complete omission from the nations history should now insist on converting the history of the united states largely into a history of the negro people but the new american history cannot answer the call either for preferential treatment as is advocated in the argument for greater job opportunities for negroes or for proportional representation as if history could be allocated to people in the way that congressional districts are arranged happily there are now some historians who on the basis of preparation understanding and temperament are prepared to write the new american history but we can derive no great satisfaction from that fact for the numbers are not large and we still desperately need more such historians we need more of those who will search out the still undisclosed facts that will illuminate every page of the history of this country and we need historians who will provide new works for every level of understanding it is not enough that the new american history should be revealed in the pages of the learned journals or even in the college textbooks many of which are still merely warmedover versions of the old history the new american history must become a part of the curriculum of our schools the need for a new history in the elementary grades and in the eighth and eleventh grades is at least as great as the need for a new mathematics or a new biology i hasten to add that the new american history requires still other qualities of the historian namely commitment determination and courage while the parents and others may accept the new math merely because they are mesmerized by its mysteries many of them will not take the new history without a fight they confidently feel that they know the history of their country and the uses to which history should be put unaccustomed as they are to revisionism or indeed to any innovations they will resist change with a fierceness that will frighten the fainthearted and with a zeal that will defeat the uncommitted for example one must not be surprised if management is outraged by any suggestion that selfishness has been a motivating force in the conduct of american business or if labors feelings are hurt by a description of racial discrimination in the unions one must be prepared to hear patriotic mothers expressing distress if the new history has no picture of betsy ross making the first american flag and isolationists decrying any reference to the united nations and one must realize that ethnic and minority groups will have axes to grind such as negroes weeping if the recently discovered negro cowboys do not receive equal treatment in the story of the winning of the west the forces resisting the new american history have great influence and are in many instances wellorganized a member of a school board in a great american city has declared that as long as one of the new history books has a certain statement in it she will mock its use in the schools of that city the statement is a quotation from president lincolns speech to the negroes of richmond in which one of his listeners reported him as having said let me say god has made you free although you have been deprived of your godgiven rights by your socalled masters you are now as free as i am and if those that claim to be your superiors do not know that you are free take the sword and bayonet and teach them that you are free for god created all men free giving to each the same rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness one wonders what the board members reaction would have been if instead of using the richmond quotation the historian had used the peoria quotation in which lincoln said that he did not believe in the social and political equality of whites and negroes the ingenuity as well as the resources of the opponents of the new american history may be regarded as virtually limitless in one state where a new history book has been under consideration it has been condemned as one that is designed to give a white child a sense of guilt because it has an entire chapter on slavery and because there is a drawing of a negro child in looking rather wistfully at a group of white children playing on a school ground opponents have demanded that the drawing be omitted or that it be redrawn to include the negro child at play with the white children it is indeed easier to redraw the picture than to integrate the schools of south carolina in or in the book has been condemned as polemical because it presents a chart showing that school desegregation has progressed at a snails pace it is true that a new day has dawned for the new american history it enjoys a congenial climate and it flourishes in some places but if one seeks merely to promote the study of historyany history in the united states the line of least resistance still is to write the old history that offends no one except history itself and those who have no place in it but we cannot take that line any more than we can desert the larger struggle for equality for the new american history is in a real sense a part of the struggle to achieve dignity and equality in american life if any among us ever fancied ourselves as resting safely in the ivory tower of learning alienated from life itself then we should retreat to the security of the old history but if we regard ourselves as fighters for freedom and equality we need not go far to find the battleground the opponentsthe defenders of the old order and the old historylie in wait and the battleground is at the very place where we take up our pens and do battle for a new truthseeking democratic american history in our a number of mean something country we celebrate nationwide holidays like george washingtons birthday but we also have historic days which primarily to a particular group or which are celebrated in only one state or region it is not surprising that the negro a longtime american would have his quota of special days to remember it is to be noted too that these negro history holidays were dates on which something had taken place not locally but on the national or international scene the first of these historic days is a case in pointmarch this was the boston massacre in which the british soldiers shot and killed five civilians one of these was crispus attucks a mulatto the first to die the boston massacre would not be forgottenthe colonial patriots would see to that its anniversary was duly observed each year in a public ceremony bells would toll during the day and in the evening a leading citizen would deliver a stirring address against british tyranny the boston massacre marked the dawn of the american revolution but in with the coming of the fourth of july it fell into disuse as a holiday it was resurrected by boston negroes in as a protest against the dred scott decision appropriately enough the meeting place of the commemorative exercises was faneuil hall from which attucks had been buried and the speaker was the abolitionist orator wendell phillips thirty years later in the dream of the boston negroes was realized when the state legislature and the city council appropriated for the erection of a crispus attucks monument to be placed on the boston common in the occurrence which we commemorate the colored race has a profound interest for one of that race was the principal figure in it said william h dupree negro chairman of the citizens committee as he opened the exercises boston negroes of a later generation would succeed in having governors of the state officially proclaim march as crispus attucks day another date dear to negroes of a bygone century was august west india emancipation day when in an act of parliament abolishing slavery in englands island possessions went into effect negroes and their abolitionist supporters were not enthusiastic about our own fourth of july believing it a mockery to celebrate american independence and freedom as long as slavery existed in our country they found a satisfying substitute in august it was a date of vast significance to us wrote peter h clark of cincinnati it was the morning star heralding the rise of the sun of our liberty in many instances negroes celebrated august in company with whites for racial intermingling in a friendly and relaxed setting no affair could touch an august picnic in some instances negroes held celebrations all their own this was particularly true after the civil war whites ceasing to mark the day once american slavery had ended negroes however continued to welcome all who might wish to come to the celebration in topeka kansas in they extended an earnest invitation to all freedom loving white persons to turn out with us on that occasion the august anniversaries naturally struck a serious note with a sermon and an address often climaxed by an original poem by someone like frances e w harper or j m whitfield but coming in midsummer an august celebration was sometimes held in a shady grove thus becoming something of a picnic in fact if not in name the proceedings might be enlivened by games of dexterity and stunts and perhaps a band concert a military drill a fireworks display or even a balloon ascension in the cities the day might be ended by a formal dance or by a concert by someone like elizabeth greenfield the black swan in san francisco in the sponsors of the celebration advised potential customers not to worry about how to get home assuring them that the horse cars will run all night with the coming of the twentieth century the august celebrations tended to become fewer being observed mainly by negroes who had come from the west indies the civil war years brought two of the negros historic holidays both of them slaveemancipating occasions the first of these was april when the slaves in the district of columbia were set free by an act of congress lifting their voices in joy and thanksgiving negroes from coast to coast held a series of celebration meetings if we rejoice and give thanks to the almighty wrote the editor of the angloafrican we rejoice less as black men than as part and parcel of the american people for it is clearly a great boon to the nation at large than to the class more immediately concerned however the subsequent observance of april was almost exclusively left in the hands of the negro understandably too it gradually became a district of columbia affair primarily generally the april celebrations took the form of a street parade followed by a formal speech indoors led by a squad of mounted police the parade was usually directed by christian a fleetwood a congressional medal winner for heroism in the civil war companies of the national guard benevolent societies and fraternal organizations made up the line of march generally the procession halted before the home of senator charles sumner while the band played auld lang syne then the paraders went to a hall or a church for a twohour address by the speaker of the day often this would be the peerless frederick douglass a resident of the district with his death in the celebration lost something it never regained the second of the slaveemancipating occasions celebrated by negroes was the day of jubilee itselfjanuary the day when president lincoln declared free the slaves in the rebellious states negroes could scarcely contain themselves over the good news throughout the country there were proclamation meetings all of them the scenes of joyous excitement the most glorious day this nation has ever seen wrote the young schoolteacher charlotte forten in her diary certainly it was the greatest day in the history of the negro american its annual observance became an honored tradition the historian frenise a logan describes a typical emancipation day celebration in the towns throughout north carolina replete with brass band a negro militia company a negro fire company and several social organizations negroes would march through the principal streets to the courthouse here the procession would gather to hear the reading of the emancipation proclamation followed by an address from a prominent negro or a sympathetic white man but for all its importance emancipation day came at a season when the weather was likely to be cold and blustery hence some negroes preferred september as slaveemancipation day it was on this date in that lincoln issued his preliminary proclamation declaring that if the rebel states did not lay down their arms by january he would declare their slaves free but as a historic holiday september despite its more favorable position on the calendar never really rivalled january after the latter itself lost some of its popular appeal tending to become an indoors affair even in the warmer climates with the negro churches as its chief sponsor out of the freeing of the slaves came some of the negro holidays restricted to one state on july nev york negroes inaugurated the annual observance of the abolition of slavery in their state in the negroes in texas launched the yearly celebration of june juneteenththe day on which slavery there came to its end during the hopeful years after the civil war the negro people warmed up the fourth of july now that slavery was gone they felt that they could celebrate independence day without mixed emotions certainly if anyone had a right to celebrate the fourth it was the negro the return of the festival of our national independence wrote john greenleaf whittier in has called our attention to a matter which has been carefully kept out of sight by orators and toastdrinkers we allude to the participation of colored men in the great struggle for american freedom negroes had always wished to unite with other americans in observing the glorious fourth indeed as if in anticipation the young men of the banneker institute in philadelphia held an independence day celebration at franklin hall in a brass and string band played several national airs opening with hail columbia the orator of the day william h johnson asserted that the declaration of independence included black men as well as white men and that it encourages us to live and labor zealously for our rights here in america johnsons words seemed to come true in when the fifteenth amendment was ratified sometimes referred to as the keystone of reconstruction this measure sought to protect the negro at the polls the day of ratification was march and it marked another day to be encircled in the negros calendar in some cities negro women wore shawls of red white and blue at a ratification celebration held in baltimore more than negroes marched through the streets we have a future everything is possible to us said one of the speakers ratification day did indeed seem to have a future some negroes preferred it to emancipation day on the grounds that lincolns proclamation benefited the slave whereas the fifteenth amendment benefited all negroes and it was true that the amendment was ad vantageous to the negro whether north or south its sponsors definitely having in mind the negro vote in the north but the march observances petered out within a decade baltimore holding one of the last of them in by then the southern negro was fast losing the ballot and the bright promises of reconstruction were fading hence it is not surprising that a civil_rights act passed in gave rise to no new negro holiday it was just as well eight years later in the supreme court ruled that the act was illegal the day this decision was handed down was a gloomy one for negroes a day not unlike that on which john brown was hanged or lincoln was shot in the twentieth century perhaps the nearest thing to a nationwide negro history holiday would be may when the supreme court ruled that public school segregation was contrary to the constitution but since world war ii there have been many breakthroughs and firsts on the race relations front with so many things happening no single date could take on standout proportions in taking a final glance at the negro redletter days it is to be noted that all of them celebrate some aspect of freedom this is their significance and their essential americanism for what is it that makes the united states a nation not a common ancestry and not a history stretching back into legendary times our nationhood is based upon our commitment to the ideas of liberty and equality these are the twin goals which negro americans have expounded and for which so many have put their lives on the line and the holidays which they have held in highest esteem were those which marked a milestone in their countrys journey along freedom road contrary to the beliefs of all too many scholars relatively large numbers of negro americans have for centuries identified with africa this identification has been reflected in backtoafrica movements missionary efforts historicalcultural references and what i here refer to as the rhetoric of african recognitionthat is the accept ance and affirmation of ones african origins the major focus of this paper is on w e b du bois and to a lesser extent carter woodson two of this centurys leading advocates of african consciousness among negro americans these men however were not alone in their concern with african history and culture othersmartin delaney and alexander crummell during the th century bruce and schomburg during the th to name a fewspent much of their lives in search of the african past though the latter two were not as well equipped by training to unravel what was at best a conundrum for most americans in the early part of the century their views are nevertheless mentioned for both men played significant roles in promoting the study of african history and culture it is beyond the scope of this paper to attempt an exposition and interpretation of the full corpus of thought on africa entertained by du bois and woodson my purpose is to present the most salient views of du bois and woodson on africa and test them at certain critical points against the findings of modern scholarship in the process i hope to determine the extent to which these men provided a better understanding of the history of africa moreover i shall present the views of du bois and woodson against that backdrop of african consciousness among many negroes which persisted despite efforts at repression over the centuries with respect to du bois writings on the psyches of persons of african descent i want to suggest through the introduction of fairly representative examples of his thinking on the subject an analogy between his views and the negritude schools of thought finally i have not entered into a discussion of either the garvey movement or the new negro movement but certainly a more complete treatment of the conflict between garvey and du bois over the african question is much needed and long overdue and an examination of the artistic views held by du bois visavis poets like langston hughes claude mckay and countee cullen would certainly throw into sharper relief the particular variant of negritude espoused by du bois however terrible the shocks through which slaves went before and after their arrival in americatraumas which p doubtless in time erased practically all memories of the an cestral home from the minds of these black mensome articulate ones among the race throughout the centuries identified with africa in making this identification they probably spoke for a large segment of the inarticulate masses benjamin banneker writing at a time when mockery was made of the negros color and ancestral home wrote to thomas jefferson in that he freely and cheerfully acknowledged the fact that he was of the african race and in that color which is natural to them of the deepest dye forty years later david walker in his militant appeal urged the slaves to revolt exclaiming if any are anxious to ascertain who i am know the world that i am one of the oppressed degraded and wretched sons of africa rendered so by the avaricious and unmerciful among the whites between bannekers letter and walkers appeal an event took place which probably had much to do with the way many th century negroes were later to view africain the american colonization society was founded for the purpose of transporting all free negroes back to africa st clair drake has observed drake is probably correct in his theory that after the formation of the american colonization society many negroes tended to eschew use of the word african and opt for colored nevertheless the use of the word african was much in evidence throughout the th century having frequently been used by negro abolitionists and intellectualsnotably henry h garnett and alexander crummelland reconstruction leaders such as richard cain and bishop henry m turner indeed these men not only frequently referred to negroes as africans but made a more significant identification with africa by advocating at one time or another emigration to africa in this regard crummell and turner had lasting influence identification with africa at the turn of the century seemed to be as it had been during earlier periods closely related to how negroes were faring in america during the s increasingly large numbers of negroes became disenchanted with race relations and either looked to africa or to central america as a place of refugein much the same way that embattled jews have looked to israel in our time the harsh decades from to doubtless contributed to the efficacy of bishop turners back to africa movement and to the growth of african consciousness along historical lines by the close of the century unquestionably as the lines of race hardened in the opening years of the century august meier has written there was an increasing tendency to use negro history to foster race pride and group solidarity as the basis of advancement by collective action and as an antidote to prejudice and discrimination as an expression of this growing interest in the heritage of people of african descent there was a veritable proliferation of negro history groups prominent among such groups were the american negro historical society of philadelphia the negro society for historical research and the association for the study of negro life and history it should be recalled that the influence of social darwinism was not inconsiderable in america during the last quarter of the th century and the early decades of the th century the period during which negroes were becoming increasingly interested in their history glorifiers of the anglosaxon race sat in some of the most important seats of learning propounding the thesis that only the teutonic nations were able to maintain states in which freedom could flourish james k hosmer short history of anglosaxon freedom and john w burgess political science and comparative constitutional law celebrated the anglosaxon virtues and sought to establish the view that government of the people and by the people is of ancient anglosaxon origin rejecting the notion that africans and asians could govern themselves hosmer concluded that the inevitable issue is to be that ft the primacy of the world will lie with us english institutions english speech english thought are to become the main features of the political social and intellectual life of mankind people of color to be sure were unfit and not likely to survive but the traducers of people of african descent in the western world had long been active drake has written thus a formidable task lay ahead for those who would attempt to establish the negros humanity by reclaiming his heritage for the heritage of negroesslave as well as africanhad been systematically scored for centuries while it would be easier for negro scholars and writers to demonstrate negro achievement in americanell william wells brown and george washington williams had long since documented negro achievements from the colonial period to the civil war the job of discovering african achievement would for a number of reasons be much more formidable for one thing previous identification with africa among th century negroes had taken in the main missionary or emigrationist lines for another european expansion into africa during the th century had been attended by considerable antiafrican propaganda this expansion according to drake came at a period when the coincidence of certain factors made an extremely derogatory appraisal of africa almost inevitable among these factors were the tide of humanitarian sentiment the theory of the survival of the fittest the movement to set out to save africa for christ the attempt to partition africa and break native resistance and the rapid increase of literacy which laid the base for a penny press selling sensationalism the members of the various american negro historical associations were not unmindful of this propaganda they like other american negroes growing up in the early part of the twentieth century probably heard of africa in church when ministers appealed for financial aid to support missionary work in africa the president of the negro society for historical research john edward bruce in some ways anticipating cheikh anta diop declared that the history of whites prior to b c was a monumental fraud a total blank the white man stole his alphabet and derived his knowledge of science and religion from ancient african civilization which bore more than favorable comparison in many respects to modern europe the secretary of the society arthur a schomburg urged negroes to learn arabic because much of our life is undoubtedly wrapped up in the history customs and traditions of africa negro history should be taught in the public schools because it is the season for us to devote our time to kindling the torches that will inspire us to racial integrity the most impressive and scholarly work done by negroes to recover the african past and instill pride in negroes however was done by carter woodson and w e b du bois though both were better equipped by training than men like bruce and schomburg there was no question that they were out to prove through the application of science to history the essential humanity of people of african descent this desire led both men to attack negro stereotypes born of the slave experience as well as those more directly related to europan expansion into africa at the close of the th century as one of the first negro scholars thoroughly grounded in the scientific method of handling historical materials carter woodson was a leader in the effort to present a more faithful representation of the negros past it might be said that his concern over the harm being done to the american negros psyche by racist propaganda led him to explore the african roots of that past l d reddick writing in crisis has described the forces which led woodson to realize the need for a racial revision of the writing of the history of people of african descent woodson saw clearly what american culture was doing to the psyche of the negro racist elements were strong whether one looked at literature newspapers science or social science historically most of the nations scientists social as well as naturalhad gone along with the theory that the negro was a more animallike physical type and definitely inferior mentally actually the whole context of this consideration was subjective yet to the man in the street the words of an eminent biologist anthropologist or psychologist meant scientific proof it was this scientific proof that woodson set out to challenge in his most noted work the negro in our history he devotes four chapters to african history and one to african art writing in a time in which few american historians evinced an interest in african history woodson discusses among other things the geography of africa the myth of african inferiority and the misrepresentation of travelers public functionaries and missionaries in africa concerning the missionaries he reports that among a few there was some tendency toward fairmindedness and an attempt to rise unto an appreciation of the africans contribution to civilization many of them however use exaggerating language contradicting themselves in praising africans in one place and denouncing them in another the missionarys account of the african cannot in the main be relied on for it would be unwise to expect that the partisans of a particular religion seeking to uproot another can be depended upon to report definitely on the virtues of the people whom they would proselyte woodson observed that if the missionary had a good impression of the natives religion and morals he would necessarily be disqualified for missionary effort he argues that the books written by most of these missionaries therefore are largely worthless in arriving at an appreciation of african culture implicit in woodsons criticism of the accounts of travelers public functionaries and missionaries was his own deep appreciation of african civilization he believed that black africans had not only distinguished themselves in developing and maintaining empires of the stature of ghana mali and songhay but were in large measure responsible for the birth of egyptian civilization for carter woodson history seems to indicate that that country egypt was first settled by a negro tribe that mingled later with mediterranean people coming from the north egypt was the land of mixed breed or persons comparable to negroes passing in america onethird of the egyptians in his view were distinctly black woodson based much of his thinking on black african influence in egypt on the works of the distinguished anthropologist franz boas particularly boas the mind of primitive man and leo frobenius the voice of africa though railed at by many who thought he was making too much of black african achievements woodsons insistence that egypt was greatly influenced by black africa has since been corroborated by many distinguished africanists notably basil davidson and immanuel wallerstein to be sure few serious students of africa today deny this influence though there is some disagreement as to the extent of black african participation in the construction of egyptian civilization carter woodson devoted considerable attention to african empires in his writings this was especially true as regards his treatment of ghana more than any other american says rayford logan woodson made known the medieval kingdom of ghana so that it evoked real meaning when the gold coast became selfgoverning on march his the african background outlined according to melville j herskovits represented a serious attempt to comprehend the entire picture of the negro african and new world in its historical and functional setting woodsons discussion of african institutions does not for the most part vary significantly from what anthropologists such as herskovits have subsequently written concerning traditional african life and customs he clearly demonstrated that there was nothing simple and backward about the organization of african societies with respect to the training of children the conception of religion the morals of the people and the forms of political organization and woodson fully realized the need for american negroes to understand and appreciate these aspects of the african past for as herskovits has remarked concerning this matter no group in the population of this country has been more completely convinced of the inferior nature of the african background than have the negroes woodson speaking of general reactions among negroes framed the problem in in these terms just as woodson detected africanisms in american negro religious practices so did he view new world negro artistic expression as being under the strong influence of africa which was in his view the natural setting indeed woodson held to a view of the negro much like that held by later proponents of negritude it is generally agreed now he wrote that the negro has more of a spiritual makeup than other races he has not permitted his mind wholly to dominate his body he feels things deeply and he can express them emotionally the negros art could be explained by his temperament or his natural gifts no one else popularized interest in africa among american negroes as much as woodson he could number scholars and large segments of the negro people among his followers the interest in africa inspired by woodson was accomplished through the annual meetings of the association for the study of negro life and history which he headed through his negro history week celebrations which he began promoting in and through the pages of the journal of negro history in addition to the meetings of the association and negro history week as vehicles for imparting information on africa was the negro in our history a book which had gone through eight printings by the end of world war ii though undistinguished in style and organization this book as rayford w logan pointed out in conveyed to more persons white and black pertinent information about the negro than has any other single volume in the year carter woodson established the association for the study of negro life and history the home university library brought out w e b du bois slim little volume the negro if woodson had a greater impact on american negroes in the promotion of african history du bois influence on africans and the american academic community was destined to be far greater very early in his life while but a child on his greatgrandmothers knee he had had his first introduction to africa it is of no small significance that his introduction was cultural with africa i had only one direct cultural connection and that was the african melody which my greatgrandmother used to sing where she learned it i do not know perhaps she herself was born in africa or had it of a mother or father stolen and transported but at any rate coming to the valleys of the hudson and housatonic black little and lithe she shivered and shrank in the harsh north winds looked longingly at the hills and often crooned a heathen melody to the child between her knees thus do bana coba gene me gene me do bana coba gene me gene me ben dnuli nuli null ben dle if the significance of this strange music did not surface upon the consciousness of du bois until later his african racial feeling came exclusively from his later learning and reaction his recoil from the assumptions of the whites and his experience in the south and at fisk he felt himself african by race an integral member of the group of dark americans who were called negroes by the time he entered harvard in du bois largely due to his experiences at fisk university had already developed an interest in negro american culture much superior to that of most negro students so close were africans and negroes linked together in his mind that he chose for his harvard commencement address the topic jefferson davis and the african which was later changed to jefferson davis as a representative of civilization in his masters thesisthe suppression of the slave tradeafrica and the american negro were again linked this study was published in the annual report of the american historical association as the enforcement of the slave trade laws the first of the major du bois historical works which earned for him the title of historian was through the publication of the volume the suppression of the african slave trade to the united states of america in partial fulfillment for the degree of doctor of philosophy awarded in at harvard university du bois was years of age when he worked on this subject there were chapters and appendices embracing colonist and state legislation and typical slave trade cases in pages with voluminous footnotes and a bibliography the study won a place as the first volume of the harvard historical series daniel p mannix and malcolm cowley remark in black cargoes that the suppression of the african slave trade has not been superseded as an account of the political struggles over the trade du bois based the study on national and state historical sources colonial statutes congressional documents personal narratives and reports of antislavery societies reviews of the book in the american historical review the english historical review the annals of the american academy the atlantic monthly and the nation were on the whole quite favorable at this point in his intellectual development du bois had not evinced a serious interest in african history as such while at harvard albert bushnell hart had directed his attention to the history of the negro but there was at harvard at that time little knowledge of or interest in the history of africa four years prior to the publication of his doctoral dissertation however du bois had resolved to make a name in science to make a name in literature and thus to raise my race this decision before long led him to deepen his interest in africa by du bois was in london writing the resolutions for the first panafrican conference in an address written for the occasion du bois identified those present as men and women of african blood and declared that the history of the world both ancient and modern has given many instances of no despicable ability and capacity among the blackest races of men du bois called for the cessation of sacrificing african natives to the greed of gold cautioned against robbing them of their liberties debauching their family life and repressing their aspirations he spoke of the ruthless economic exploitation and political downfall of less developed nations and called on britain germany and france to look to the best in their traditions and promote progress and prosperity in their colonies the identification of negro american and african which du bois earlier had made an integral part of his thinking was expressed on the political plane in a passage which brought together people of african descent throughout the world let the nations of the world respect the integrity and independence of the free negro states of abyssinia liberia haiti and the rest and let the inhabitants of these states the independent tribes of africa the negroes of the west indies and america and the black subjects of all nations take courage strive ceaselessly and fight bravely that they may prove to the world their incontestible right to be counted among the great brotherhood of mankind his championing of panafricanism dates from that address which followed by years the congress of berlin at a time when practically the whole of africa was under european domination du bois was affirming the essential humanity of africans and calling for an end to the exploitation of that continent but it would not be until some years later that he would attempt to set forth the contributions to world history of the blackest races of men in franz boas spoke at atlanta university du bois was never the same after hearing the words of the great anthropologist it was boas who brought the history of africa to his attention few today are interested in negro history because they feel the matter settled the negro has no history i remember my own sudden awakening from the paralysis of this judgment taught me in high school and in two of the worlds great universities franz boas came to atlanta university where i was teaching history in and said to a graduating class you need not be ashamed of your african past and then he recounted the history of the black kingdom of the sahara for a thousand years i was too astonished to speak all of this i had never heard and came then and afterwards to realize how the silence and neglect of science can let truth utterly disappear or even be unconsciously distorted nine years later the home university library published du bois the negro a book devoted largely to african history including chapters on ethiopia and egypt african culture the slave trade and the west coast of africa the book was in many ways up to that time the most impressive one written by an american in the field of african history writing in the preface to the book du bois pointed out that the time has not yet come for a complete history of the negro peoples noting the fact that archaeological research had just begun in africa du bois contended that racial prejudice against darker peoples was too strong in socalled civilized centers for judicial appraisement of africa dr du bois essayed to present such short general statement of the main known facts and their fair interpretation as shall enable the general reader to know as men a sixth or more of the human race the negro was of interest to the scholar as well as to the general reader small in size but large in quality the book utilizes the theories of franz boas and guiseppi sergi additional writers on whom du bois relied in varying degrees were ibn batuta leo africanus leo frobenius h barth w d cooley lady lugard and e w blyden to name a few most africanists today will probably not subscribe to du bois viewborrowed from boasthat black african people were the first to smelt iron but his assertion that egypt was influenced by black africans is agreed upon by a significant number of scholars and his outline of west african empires seems in the main consonant with the best of modern scholarship at the time du bois wrote of these empires few scholars were willing to believe they even existed dr du bois in addition to challenging the aryan myth of superiority took issue with those who espoused the view that islam was responsible for the creation of west african states a position still subscribed to by some scholars islam did not found new states but modified and united negro states already ancient it did not initiate new commerce but developed a widespread trade already established it is as frobenius says easily proved from chronicles written in arabic that islam was only effective in fact as a fertilizer and stimulant efforts to ascribe the artistic products of yoruban civilization to the white race also came in for considerable criticism as did similar efforts so fashionable at the time the negro was writtento attribute every evidence of sophisticated achievement to the inspiration of white people du bois in concluding sets forth the thesis of class conflict and the unity of the white and black working classes for the establishment of a better society writing vigorously and succinctly wesley remarks du bois presented facts about african history and culture which were unknown in a time when the concept of racial inferiority and african savagery were rampant and dominant in the thought of the american people in the preface to black folk then and now a work published in du bois commented that he wanted to do again and i hope somewhat more thoroughly the task which i attempted twentythree years ago in a little volume of the home university library called the negro he tells the reader that some of the material of the negro is incorporated in black folk then and now but that the new book is an entirely new production and seeks to bring to notice the facts concerning the negro if not entirely according to the results of thorough scholarship at least with scholarship as good as i am able to command with the time and money at my disposal du bois does not hide the fact that in addition to his role as an historian he will be the advocate of people of african descent observing i do not for a moment doubt that my negro descent and narrow group culture have in many ways predisposed me to interpret my facts too favorably for my race but there is little danger of long misleading here for the champions of white folk are legion the negro has long been the clown of history the football of anthropology and the slave of industry i am trying to show here why these attitudes can no longer be maintained i realize that the truth of history lies not in the mouths of partisans but rather in the calm science that sits between her cause i seek to serve and wherever i fail i am at least paying truth the respect of earnest effort du bois was concerned therefore not only about the history of people of african descent but in addition with the relationship of these facts upon race prejudice in the modern world utilizing materials unavailable at the time the negro was written he seeks to reevaluate africa and its civilization in the light of these more recent findings there is a somewhat detailed discussion of the word negro one in which du bois points out the fallacy of restricting it to certain groups of africans the black and brown people of ethiopia egypt and north africa according to the american standard would be regarded as negroes not whites as certain writers designate them in essential agreement with carter woodson du bois in black folk then and now attacks the practice of designating hamitic peoples as white it is his view that millions of negroidssome of them the blackest of menunder cover of the term hamite were characteristically transferred to the white race by some eager scientists he contends that a hamite is simply a mulatto of ancient negro and semitic blood thus according to du bois the civilizations of north africa owing to the infusion of negro blood must be considered at least in part negroid civilizations a position not only attested by contemporaries such as franz boas but one which is supported by later scholars such as immanuel wallerstein of columbia university suffice it to say now for the purpose of discussing the african past that the best evidence of today seems to indicate a very great racial intermingling in africa as elsewhere over the past five thousand years and that the egyptians or hamites of yesteryear might well find themselves classified as negroes today in precisely those countries where such classifications matter suffice it further to note that many of the archaeological remains of which we shall speak at first credited to arabs or hamites have on closer or less biased inspection turned out to be unmistakably negroafrican in origin in his chapter the trade in men du bois sets forth a number of interesting theories he ascribes the decline of african culture to the slave trade which he contends robbed africa of from a fourth to a third of its population whole regions were depopulated whole tribes disappeared and the character of the people developed excesses of cruelty instead of the flourishing arts of peace and yet du bois avers people ask today the cause of the stagnation of culture in that land since there are to be sure many africanists who today would question du bois position regarding the number of people lost to the slave trade their figures being considerably more conservative than his yet few deny the contention that the impact of the trade however much it accelerated commerce and stimulated the growth of new kingdoms wreaked considerable havoc among the people whom the trade affected most du bois speaks of the great and significant contribution of the labor of blacks that the trade made available to the rise of western industry and the growth of capitalism a position that eric williams was later to develop in some considerable detail in his capitalism and slavery whatever the contribution of brawn however the human loss was staggering raphael painted luther preached corneille wrote and milton sang and through it all for years the dark captives wound to the sea amid the bleaching bones of the dead for years the sharks followed the scurrying ships for years america was strewn with the living and dying millions of a transplanted race for years ethiopia stretched forth her hands unto god something of the poetof the historian and prose writer at his best is reflected in the above passage he is more clearly the advocate in the world and africa this work includes a number of chapters on african history chapters which are in some respects quite similar to those found in the negro and black folk then and now the edition published in contains essays on panafricanism the relationship between africa and china and a variety of additional pieces which appeared originally in newspapers in the foreword of the edition however du bois describes the world and africa as not so much a history of negroid peoples as a statement of their integral role in human history from prehistoric to modern times the edition is that and more du bois sees the future of the african people linked with world socialism in this regard it is interesting to note du bois urges africans to base their socialism on the socialism of former african societies and concludes awake awake put on thy strength o zion reject the weakness of missionaries who teach neither love nor brotherhood but chiefly the virtues of in discussing the work of du bois carter woodson and others in the writing of african history august meier concludes most significant was the work of du bois not only was he aware of the complexity and sophistication of contemporary african culture but also acting more on mystic racial yearnings than on scientific investigation du bois was the precursor of the africanist melville j herkovits in tracing the american negro culture and institutions to african origins did his mystic racial yearnings cast him in the role of precursor to the later negritude movement as early as he wrote i am the smoke king i am black i am darkening with song i am hearkening to wrong i will be black as blackness can the blacker the mantle the mightier the man i am carving god in night i am painting hell in white i am the smoke king i am black the celebration of blacknessthe attempt to transmute its negative attributes into positive onesappears time and time again in the writings of du bois six years before the publication of the souls of black folk du bois gave what was perhaps the first indication that he felt the negro possessed certain peculiar artistic qualities that america could ignore only at her peril the negro said du bois in a paper submitted to the american negro academy had given america its only original music its only touch of humor and pathos amid its mad moneygetting plutocracy du bois then believed in a race spirit which he considered the greatest invention for human progress du bois belief in racial integrity was in this respect similar to that of schomburg who a few years later was to speak of kindling the torches which inspire to racial integrity the negros artistic gifts were due to subtle psychic differences which characterized all men dividing them into races he was later to develop this thesis at some length in a bookthe gift of black folk the very title of which calls to mind the views of the negritude schooof writers before the appearance of this book however du bois published the souls of black folk a work which affected not only american negroes but africans as well saunders redding reports that peter abrahams of south africa said that until he read this book he had no words with which to express his negroness abrahams himself wrote that the book had the impact of a revelation a key to the understanding of my world the dualism so prevalent in the thinking of leopold senghor aime cesaire and other proponents of negritude is expressed by du bois in the opening chapter of souls it is a peculiar sensation this doubleconsciousness this sense of always looking at ones self through the eyes of others of measuring ones soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity one ever feels his twonessan american a negro two souls two thoughts two unreconciled strivings two warring ideals in one dark body whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder and there is the same longing for a higher synthesis of which senghor speaks in referring to cross cultural fertilization he the negro would not africanize america for america has too much to offer the world and africa he would not bleach his negro soul in a flood of white americanism for he knows that negro blood has a message for the world the allusions to negro blood often appear in the writings of du bois just as senghor often refers to african blood the negro never lost his african temperament or style of life du bois asserts in the gift of black folk he refers to a peculiar spiritual quality which the negro has brought into american life and civilization a certain spiritual joyousness a sensuous tropical love of life as against new england reason which was cool and cautious a slow and dreamful conception of the universe together with an intense sensitiveness to spiritual valuesall qualities which in his view tell of the imprint of africa on europe in america there is no denying or explaining away du bois remarks this tremendous contact of the north and south of black and white of anglosaxon and negro the qualities of negritude of being negro developed deep in the forest fastness and by the banks of low vast rivers in the deep tense quiet of the jungle where the human soul whispered its folk tales carved its pictures sang its rhythmic songs and danced and danced describing the music of the slavethe spiritualdu bois hears the sorrow of riven souls suddenly articulate the sobs of raped daughters the quiver of murdered bodies the defiance of deathless hope it is great art born of suffering and tragedy in another passage from the gifts of black folk du bois describes the slave laborer as a product of the tropics who possessed sensuous receptivity to the beauty of the world and was therefore not easily reduced to the mechanical drafthorse which the northern european laborer became though often accused of laziness the slave brought to modern manual labor a renewed valuation of life du boisin affirming the emotional nature of negroes in his use of culture as a basis for group solidarity in zealously attempting to rediscover the historic roots of the negro people in positing the notion that negroeswherever they livehave a certain style of life and in his allusions to primitive african socialismwas a precursor of negritude much like cesaire his negritude theories were not hammered into a comprehensive system of thought and like cesaire they appear to derive more from his personal stand as a writer student of history and culture and black man caught between two worlds as charles wesley has written most of du bois workseven his novelshave included some material on the african background in addition to books and articles in which mention was made of africa for many years du bois promoted a pageant based on the african past a pageant designed for children it appears that his mind conceived practically every conceivable use to which african history could be put including teaching it in sunday school to youngsters this is not the place for an assessment of his work in fathering and promoting the panafrican movement let it suffice to say as has martin kilson that he had a deep spiritual attachment to and belief in africa and her peoples and in his dedication to panafricanism there was no sacrifice too great for him to bear nor any road too difficult for him to travel he has been hailed as the father of panafricanism by heads of african countries and his influence has been recognized by african leaders from kenyatta to nkrumah it can be said in perfect justice that generations of negro intellectuals changed their negative views of africa due to the influence of du bois he left the united states in his nineties and returned to africa to become a citizen of ghana and set in motion a project of which he had long dreamedthe writing of an encyclopedia africana when he died at he had at least lived to see a number of stages in the project completed more importantly however he had left behind an historic record which today corroborates the view which he espoused in at the london panafrican conference that the worlds history both ancient and modern has given many instances of no despicable ability and capacity among the blackest races of men let us suppose that by edict of some authority it was decreed that a theory similar to the nazi master race theory must be incorporated in our american history and taught in our schools certainly the public would be shocked and revolted by a decree affirming the superiority of aryans and the inferiority of jews teachers would rise in horror how could we teach this false theory how could we pervert the history of our country and commit such injury to the tender and impressionable minds of our youth but let us go on to suppose that we were compelled by an irresistible force to do what we fully knew was so shockingly wrong so repugnant to our consciences as teachers and citizens our phrases parroting the false doctrine would be labored and reluctant surely the sense of joy in teaching would become only a faint memory the sweat doubt and struggle of our creative act of teaching would be destroyed the common striving that gives joy and excitement to both students and teachers the search that is eager and hard for knowledge and understanding could no longer exist butis not all this just nightmare fantasy certainly we do not we need not violate our consciences in such a way in our american history classrooms our traditional history but why ask we dont teach the fantastic nazi master race theory no we do not we teach our own the ruling groups in the south have traditionally insisted that in their schools american history be taught from a white supremacist standpoint recent authoritative scholarship has shown that from about to world war ii the study of american history was dominated by scholars who reflected or accepted biased views in their work at the turn of the century john w burgess dean of the faculty of political science at columbia university in the introduction to his major work reconstruction and the constitution said a black skin means membership in a race of men which has never of itself succeeded in subjecting passion to reason has never therefore created any civilization of any kind it is also known that textbook publishers went even beyond the prevailing scholarly interpretations in their desire to cater to the southern market northern school systems based their teaching on these textbooks and historical interpretations thus a biased and censored version of american history became imbedded in both northern and southern classrooms we all grew up on itour traditional history this did not happen by the imposition of a triumphant dictatorship newly swept into power in a nation caught up in a mad ideological rampage no in our country this grand miswriting of history seeped into books teaching and traditions through the hard work of serious scholars aided and abetted by racial theories and in stitutions that flourished after the civil war as they had before weigh the magnitude of the issue it is often alluded to by the term negro history it is that and much more the course of race relationships with all of its ramifications for white and negro comprises one of the mainstreams of american history we can only contemplate what our history would have been and what our country would be like today if people from africa had come to america as freemen instead of being brought here as slaves clearly a wholesale distortion of the history of race relationships in the united states amounts to nothing less than a major falsification of americas past even so what are the effects they could hardly be benevolent our traditional history has been a bulwark of the prevailing system of prejudice discrimination and segregation in this nation insofar as we continue to deny a valid account of their history to our students both negro and white we continue to cripple their ability to understand and confront the dangerous and immoral racial system which remains deeprooted throughout our nation all in the name of education and at the taxpayers expense but as educators are we not also victims what other history could we know what other books could we obtain in the last two decades a new scholarship has emerged one which has effectively challenged this traditional history the works of its distinguished scholars are now widely accepted and respected in our universities furthermore the pioneering research of previously neglected historians such as carter g woodson and w e b dubois has achieved widespread recognition certainly the many articles monographs and books of these revisionist historians have been available to teachers civil_rights groups have publicized the issue as have nationally popular magazines such as saturday review time and newsweek yet how many teachers have responded to the challenge have we said there could be no more serious charge about my work i must sample this new scholarship to be able to assess it for myself i must bring this issue urgently to the attention of my colleagues since it is a professional challenge we must resolve together what would it mean in our classrooms if we taught the historythatactuallyhappened with the help of valid scholarship instead of that historythatwastransmitteddowntous let us explore a bit the imaginary melting pot how relevant to studentsand how historically accurateis the traditional introduction to an american history course students are told in the fifth grade again in the eighth grade and finally in the th grade that america is made up of a blend of many nationalitiesirish english dutch italian french and so on yet we exclude africans consider the provocative themes if we confronted the entire rainbow of america including africanamericans those forced immigrants for whom there was no melting in the imaginary pot perhaps teachers foresee some difficulty in mentioning the old world of africa we have studied some european history we know something of the great chinese civilizations and have confidence in our knowledge of the contributions of these great ancestors yet too often our studentsboth negro and whitethink of africa only as the dark continent egypt the cradle of civilization seems to have slipped into the mediterranean sea and her black men and women are lost chapters of history negro students know only too well that for them the melting pot is a myth but they must also learn that the dark continent is equally unreal should not their introduction to american history include the earliest use of the wheel the story of the civilizations of kush the empires of ghana mali and songhay the great city of timbuktu and the university of sankore with its scholars of many hues we will have provided ne gro youngsters with the ability to walk with new pride through the halls of their schools calling themselves askia the great or munsa musa and our white studentswill they gain a new breadth of knowledge and a shaken sense of superiority the freedom to destroy freedom w if it is true that we as a nation look with horror upon the mass murder by nazi germany of more than million persons and as teachers cannot overlook this aspect of teaching world war ii how can we continue to ignore the depopulation of the continent of africa as a result of slave trading historians state that in excess of million africans were taken from their homelands twothirds of these human beings perished as a result of the brutalities of the trade were not these engaged in thiseuropeans americans and africans alikecorrupted in a process whereby millions of souls were lost what of our rationale for the continued importation of africans to north america were white people really concerned with bringing the benefits of christianity and civilization to black people malcolm cowley in the introduction to black cargoes a history of the atlantic slave trade states that the slave trade left behind it a myth of negro inferiority an embittered conflict and a sense of guilt that refuses to disappear it is as if we were all responsible now for the sin of our forefathers and as if the sin was so great that not even the civil war could atone for it what response would it provoke if we placed the slave trade in its historical context of the renaissance period dr w e b du bois called the renaissance a birth of a new freedom the freedom to destroy freedom to exploit should we help our students locate the slave trade in the world forces of the renaissance the commercial revolution of european economic life the rise of national states in western europe and the foundation of the new world black americas strivings why is it after much time spent studying the civil war and its causes and effects so many american high school students have demonstrated by hostile reactions to open housing or school integration their desire to fight this war all over againamerican brother against american brother white power against black_power have we as teachers allowed this sea of ignorance to overflow into the streets of our isolated white communities have we been teaching the causes of the civil war as though the institution of slavery played no significant part if the black man in american history was viewed as a part of the events of our heritage if his hopes his ambitions his enslavement and resistance to that enslavement his manhood in fact were considered would this not help stem the swirling tide of prejudice apparently we have allowed our students to assume that slaves didnt think react to their conditions or desire freedom we must document not only the lives of the plantation slave and the household slave but the lives of the many slaves who worked in the cities of the south as carpenters mechanics shipbuilders etc richard c wade in the introduction to his book slavery in the cities the south states the important books and significant controversies have all assumed the plantation and farm to be the special setting of the institution yet from almost the beginning slavery was also urban and was in many ways quite different from its rural analogue thousands of free negroes lived both north and south and many negro men and women joined the abolitionist movement but in our classrooms they seem to get lost in a toobrief study of garrison and phillips the many national and state conventions held by negro men throughout this nation from colonial days attest to their paramount desire for freedom the eloquent statements prepared at these conventions and addressed to our national government should become a part of our storehouse of knowledge perhaps then white americans will not look with surprise upon the organizations of black americans today addressing the nation for equal rights we can learn much from the words of richard cain a negro congressman from south carolina on the floor of the house of representatives in washington in cain said to his white colleagues i am clothed with humanity like you i think i reason i talk i express my views as you do is there any difference between us not so far as our manhood is concerned unless it be in this that our opinions differ and mine are a little higher up than yours in fact only a small minority of whites worked actively against the racial system and received rather little honor for their efforts is it not reasonable to assume that black americas strivings were more in keeping with our espoused democracy than white americas actions lincoln was not our man it should come as no surprise that nearly negroes fought for their freedom in the civil war when we are aware of the thousands of negroes who died attempting to revolt against the system that enslaved them and their loved ones negroes will come alive in the pages of history when their debates with each other and with white abolitionists and revolutionists become a part of the drama of the classroom we must ask such fundamental questions as the following did frederick douglass agree with john brown what about the negroes who were with john brown when he raided harpers ferry what motivated them did frederick douglass simply support a braham lincoln and not disagree with him when douglass summed up his measure of lincoln at the unveiling of the freedmens monument to the man he said lincoln was not in the fullest sense of the word either our man or our model in his interests in his associations in his habits of thought and in his prejudices he was a white man we are at best only his stepchildren children by adoption children by force of circumstance and necessity but we entreat you to despise not the humble offering we this day unveil to view for while abraham lincoln saved for you a country he delivered us from a bondage according to jefferson one hour of which was worse than ages of the oppression your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose should not our students confront the great emancipator as a man as well as a myth the measure of racism an historical phenomenon the days of reconstruction following the civil war offer the most meaningful backdrop upon which to sketch the events of the recent freedom movements in the south unfortunately if we have not provided that backdrop we cannot expect our students to live in a changing society with a sense of appreciation for the historic events which have occurred since rosa parks sat down in the white section of a bus in montgomery as negroes protest their inability to vote in america today we should be able to contrast and compare the events of a hundred years ago in the same counties of the south instead too many history texts today write off the reconstruction period as a blackout of honest government we teach that money was spent unwisely during reconstruction without stating the many reforms instituted which cost extra moneythe establishment of the first public school system in the south for example we decry the carpetbaggers without realizing that many dedicated northerners went south to teach and help rebuild people and places we ignore the many black men who were free and educated in europe canada and the north during the slave period and decided to return to the south to help reconstruct their people and governmentwhich now included them we must examine carefully the black codes the documents of the early reconstruction written by white men desiring a return to slavery and the birth of the klan which gave strength to these laws then compare these codes to the new constitutions written three years later in by both negro and white men attempting to build a democracy in their southern states we find in the speeches of negro congressmen elected from their southern states to the senate and the house from the s to the words of men who were proud to be black and spoke eloquently for lasting civil_rights congressman richard cain directed the following remarks to white southern congressmen who opposed an civil_rights bill there are periods in the histories of nations and of peoples when it is necessary that men belonging to a race or races whose rights and interests are at stake should lay aside all feelings of delicacy and hesitation and vindicate their rights their character and their nationality i have been surprised at their attempts to ridicule and cast a slur upon a race of men whose labor has enabled them and theirs for years to feed and drink and thrive and fatten the debates on that bill in should be contrasted with debates on recent civil_rights legislation what eagerness young people have for the truths which will give them the ability to understand the history which they view each day in their newspapers and on television screens place the plessy vs ferguson decision of the compromise speech of booker t washington in the rewriting of each southern state constitution and the period of the white mans burden in the philippines hawaii and cuba in into the context of the racism of the new political leaders of this period when we see this complete picture of the birth of jim crow we can understand better the need for a civil_rights revolution to put an end to jim crow today have our students had a chance to dig into the tortured history of white supremacy as it developed in and affected white society in what kind of trap did white society blindly entangle itself as it pursued its massive attempts to crush the humanity of black people in southern white society before the civil war free speech and political processes were denied to any who would voice opposition to slavery violence was imbedded in the life of the communitywhether shown by the scars that marked the bodies of many slaves or by the semimilitary pattern of life in a land ever fearful of revolt a superbly ingenious moral hypocrisy imbued the thought patterns of its citizenry spokesmen of the south trump eted its superior morality and civilization while its businessmen protected by law tore apart the families of fellow humans southern economic progress was stultified under the slave system public education lagged far behind the other regions and its system of justice was subverted to the cause of human chatteldom all this is past the slaves were freed but racism became entrenched in america and when will we be free of it can our students then take the measure of racism in america as an historical phenomenon its depth scope nature and future men we shall have the record of the pastas it is transmitted to usis a living force today our traditional history is part of our consciousness it expresses itself in our daily thoughts and emotions in our interpretations of current events and our responses to these events those who wrote the traditional history which has been incorporated in textbooks and classrooms are still guiding our understanding and attitudes what they wrought is one of the keystones of the structure of racism that prevails in this country today that integrity in history is sacrificed to racial bias should be no surprise the fundamental premise of racismthat one group is superior in human qualities and the other inferioris itself false white supremacy needed a falsified na tional history to protect its original lieand got it negro children must attend school under our compulsory school laws there they are taught a history which on the one hand is compounded of prevarications based on white supremacist assumptions and which on the other hand robs them of their heritage as people of african descent and as citizens of this country what more could we do to undermine psychologically a group of unprotected children this is lying and stealing on a vast insidious and devastating scale white children too have been denied the history of their country what illusions fears and anxieties have been created as a consequence what intellectual emotional and moral disabilities have been born is this then what is happening in classrooms across america is this what we call our creative act of teachingleading our children to the poisonous wells of racist history can teachers fulfill their responsibility without knowledge of the best of modern scholarship can we simply depend upon a new textbook or must we dig into the writings of franklin woodward woodson stampp du bois and others we need not try to become experts but we should explore enough to grasp the major themes and issues to be able to consider to judge and to change this would take time and effort but the new american history this negro history and the history of white racismwhat compelling shocking reading many doubts will arise doubts about the ability to change the difficulties of change there will be inward struggle as old knowledge and attitudes resist the impact of new experience and there will be struggle in the classroom new materials new concepts new objectives how will the students respond and fellow teachers administrators parents but this struggle is not a new one the prophetic du bois sixtyfour years ago challenged teachers with the issue and the hope that lies in it malcolms essential content was so simple and elemental his arguments like thoreaus so unanswerable that the american press even when not covertly racist could not understand him accustomed as it is to the settled contradictions of civil logic in a biracial country what answer is there to the accusations that in a large part of america a century after the th amendment some kinds of murderers cannot be punished by law that the law is the murderer is it an answer that we must tolerate injustice so that we may enjoy justice contemning such deformed logic and adhering to obvious moral truths malcolm like the bogalusa deacons had little difficulty in understanding and explaining to his audiences the thomistic conception of law better than the attorney general of the united states understands it malcolm was always disconcerted when the powers that be and their exponents refused to recognize the legality of humanity his strongest vocal emphases were on words like law and right they dont use law he exclaimed of the central congolese government which was directed by outside interests and the lawfulness of the eastern government was more valid he thought because it was of its own people justice and equity and emancipation not violence not hatred not retribution and not the theology of the muslims were the central matter of malcolms oratory though that theology was useful as a repudiation of american white christianity he had entered the stream of sane and moral social teaching before his parting from elijah muhammad and was deepening his knowledge and expression of it at the moment of the death he expected each day john illo the rhetoric of malcolm_x in the columbia university forum in the american south the system of justice is crude barbaric and savage there are few parallels for it in a civilized society it is a system which enables whites to murder or maim negroes with scarcely any fear of retribution it is a system which provides for the savage cruel punishment of negroes for crimes they did or did not commit hundreds of examples can be given of this shameless thriving barbarism it is true that american liberals are vigorously fighting this system it is true that american newspapers far from hiding the evil brutal system of southern justice are exposing and condemning it but it is equally true that the system persists with the american public people standing by and doing nothing effective about it it is a grave indictment of their country that such horrors should continue joel mervis editor of south africas johannesburg times in the louisville courierjournal since july of millions of moviegoers in this country and throughout the world have seen the spectacular motion picture khartoumin cinerama ultrapanavision and technicolor some movie critics have hailed this picture as nothing less than superb and the most realistic battle action in movie history others have said that this is historical truth brought to the screen this is where the appraisers have erred the truth about the battle for the sudan in the s has been distorted to suit the needs and prejudices of the hollywood movie czars and their subjects who are mainly white the picture stars charlton heston as general charles gordon the enigmatic british mystic who was sent to the sudan in central africa to rescue an egyptian army and thousands of british civilians besieged in khartoum by the nationalist uprising of muhammad ahmad the mahdi and his devoted followers in the picture and in the extensive advertisements about it the mahdi is depicted as an arab religious fanatic he was both religious and a fanatical african nationalist but he was not an arab he was a moslem very often when it suits the antiafrican propaganda purpose of most white writers and nearly all white motion picture makers africans who are moslems and heroes are called arabs this infers that they are white men by this not so subtle method people of african descent all over the world are robbed of heroes that rightfully belong to them the motion picture khartoum is a case in point the black writer must now examine and sometimes challenge all interpretations of the history of his people and their heroes that have been made by other people for an examination of the life and times of muhammad ahmad known as the mahdi a few questions are in order who was this man and what is the significance of his fight to free the sudan from british and egyptian rule what is the importance of his country and his people what indeed is the real mahdi story the sudan is an old african country and it has not always been called the sudan it was once a part of the biblical land of kush and has also been known as nubia or bilad alnuba the arabs called the country bilad alsudan meaning the land of the blacks from the early part of the sixteenth century to the latter part of the nineteenth century the sudan was dominated by a series of invaders who ruled recklessly and taxed the people without mercy or any consideration for their well being corruption and injustice went unopposed for years until in a great leader appeared to unite the sudanese people against their oppressors his name was muhammad ahmadibnseyyidabdullah his career is synonymous with the title mahdi meaning one who is divinely directed when muhammad ahmad assumed the mahdiship in he was under he was born in august on an island in the nile river called labab in the province of dongala his family claimed to be descendants of the prophet mahomet though they were humble boat builders while muhammad ahmads brothers followed their fathers trade he displayed an aptitude for religious studies muhammad ahmad the youngest of his parents four sons was sent to a khalwa school to learn reading and writing and to commit the koran to memory his interest and enthusiasm inspired his teachers to send him to a second school in khartoum and a third one in the gezira where he completed his studies of the koran and then studied muslim laws and traditions later he journeyed to the city of berber to pursue religious studies at the hands of the sheikh mahed el kheir the renowned religious leader of the time the most notable of his many teachers was sheikh muhammad sharif by muhammad ahmad had acquired a large following and was proclaimed the mahdithe future savior of the sudan the mahdi having challenged the authority of the government had no option but to prepare for the jihad or holy war in defense of islam and for the freedom of the sudan he started to train his followers and to prepare his flags on which he inscribed there is no god but god muhammad is his prophet and the mahdi is his caliph the government detachments landed in aba in the middle of a dark night in the rainy season the soldiers felt their way towards the village amongst grass and bush and lagoons all of a sudden the mahdists fell on them using swords and spears and giving them no time to use their firearms the majority of the soldiers lost their lives and the small number that escaped the disaster fled to khartoum in their steamers the mahdists rejoiced in their first triumph and in the spoils of arms and ammunition left behind which they could use in days to come that was on august the mahdist revolution against the turkoegyptian regime had started the mahdi and his followers automatically became rebels after the incident at aba as their island was within easy reach of the government and as they were still in a minority they deemed it wise to migrate west far way from the government and to unite with their allies and associates in kordofan and the nuba mountains the mahdi and his small group of followers crossed the white nile from aba on their way westward they were continually joined by followers until they reached taqali in taqali king adam umm dabbalu gave them a hearty reception and promised them his protection the mahdi and his followers then moved to jabal qadir the attempts of the governor of kordofan to intercept their progress failed and the mahdists reached jabal qadir in safety there they were joined by the inhabitants of the surrounding mountains who flocked to join the mahdist cause others from the different parts of the sudan then journeyed in large numbers to join the mahdi and to take part in the new mission and in the struggle against the government all internal attempts to nip the mahdist revolution in the bud failed it then became imperative for egypt assisted by great britain to face the situation a large army was conscripted out of the disrupted egyptian nationalist army of urabi pasha and others and sent to khartoum by sea via suakin as soon as preparations were complete for an expedition against the mahdi the army under the command of hicks pasha moved forward the expedition first followed the white nile southwards to al dueim then it struck westward into a country most hostile to it in order to come within range of the mahdists the scouts of the mahdist army lost no chance of attacking them whenever circumstances allowed and in compliance with the orders of the mahdists the villages on the route of the turkoegyptian army were evacuated and the wells filled with earth the country through which the army was to pass was thus left desolate of inhabitants and short of drinking water as the situation of the army grew more pathetic every day differences of opinion between ala aldin pasha and hicks pasha the leaders of the army sharpened when hicks pashas expedition reached alrahad after a long and tiring march and then moved towards kazgail the mahdist hordes from el obeid and those who joined them from the baqqare jimas tribe under their sheikh asakir abu alkalam had arrived on the scene as hicks army was marching out of kazgail and entering the forest of shaykan the mahdists fell on them and a fierce battle raged for a whole day hicks army was annihilated almost to the last soldier in november with the defeat of hicks expedition the government lost its last disciplined army and most of its men and stores in the sudan what remained of the armies of the government were distributed in small garrisons defending the remaining posts those garrisons could not be depended upon in the governments struggle against mahdism the victorious mahdi then returned to el obeid to allow his armies the wellearned rest they required after their long struggle against the government to receive more disciples and followers and to start a new victorious era in the annals of the revolution soon afterwards slatin bey governor of darfur surrendered his province and became a prisoner of the mahdi for a very long time from el obeid the mahdi also sent emissaries and small forces to preach mahdism and to harass the remaining garrisons of the turkiya so the west succumbed to mahdism and the central sudan associated itself with it in the eastern sudan osman digna the mahdist hero who joined mahdism on the fall of el obeid and who was dispatched by the mahdi in the capacity of a mahdist amir to preach mahdism was able to win the tribes of the red sea hills to the mahdist cause they then began to harass the government headquarters in the eastern sudan he captured sinkat and laid siege to the government garrisons in suakin and tokar from his headquarters near suakin osman digna continually attacked the government garrisons in suakin and tokar while the mahdists moved from one victory to the other in the west now muhammad ahmad and general gordon at khartoum became rival claimants for supremacy over the minds of the sudanese people they were also rivals in another sense for both of them claimed to be the messengers of god the mahdi called himself muhammad ahmad el mahdi monutazer that is to say the prophet and guide awaited by the world his followers had already adopted the cry of muhammad ahmad rassoul allah nili allah roughly translated muhammad the messiah and messenger of allah of the many rumors that were being circulated about him and his followers one was that he intended to invade egypt to convert the mussulmen to the true faith from which they had strayed and after a massacre of the christians in egypt to go to mecca the holy city of his faith where he expected to receive the khalifat and be ordained the grand cheikh of islam the future battle lines had been drawn and both contestants had been pushed beyond the point where a compromise could be reached the mahdi was invited to khartoum to be examined in the koran to see if he was really the expected messiah he rejected the invitation and sent back the message by the grace of god and his holy prophet i am master in the sudan never shall i come to khartoum to justify myself with this sort of preaching he struck the right chord in the character of the moslem and all other sudanese tribes his plan was to unite all in one great faith wisely for his scheme he recognized the general state of discontent and most astutely used it as a fertile ground for his message he was a religious leader but he also was a shrewd politician he based arguments on the prevailing hard times and traced these to the existing government his astuteness was again shown in the way he selected as the field of his earliest efforts the most disturbed section of the country the british authorities offered a large sum for him dead or alive this action forced the mahdi to declare a holy war he promised his rapidly increasing followers the majority share of the spoils he intended to take from the oppressors a quarrel developed between the commanders sent to seize the mahdi the quarrel broke into an open fight and the two separate companies of soldiers were weakened to ineffectiveness the mahdi and his followers fell on these troops with clubs sharp sticks and stones in a short while they were destroyed then came the mahdis attempt to capture el obeid the capital of kordofan and though driven back with great losses he prevailed until after a siege of five months the town and garrison surrendered now he was hailed as the maker of miracles praise allah the messiah had come the government no longer looked upon him as a holy man zealous for religion but poor and without influence whom they could silence easily the government had already come to be despised by the people because of its weakness and corruption while the prestige of muhammad ahmad was in the ascendency the spirit of rebellion which prevailed in egypt no doubt helped to augment fanaticism in the sudan the government again sent for muhammad and he again refused to go there now followed in surprisingly rapid succession defeat after defeat for the government and success after success for the mahdi now the personality and activity of the mahdi stirred the whole of the sudanand the hopeless became hopeful and the leaderless had found a leader from the hills and the plains deserts and forests the tribes rallied to the black flag of the mahdi and pledged allegiance to his crusade tens of thousands of them the selem baggara risega homer dirrka bongo madi and bari poured into the new messiahs camp they came on horseback and on foot armed with rifles and lances or with homemade spears some were the poorest of the poor and wore only filthy loin cloths the british and the egyptians braced themselves against this tide and reshuffled their plans and forces still the tribes gathered thicker in the mahdis camp they had but one goal in view freedom or paradise the british realizing that they were about to be pushed out of the sudan brought in their most able general charles george gordon better known as chinese gordon he had served in this region before and already had a respected reputation there he was known to most of the people and liked by a large number of them gordon was a devout christian and like the mahdi had illusions of being divinely endowed when gordon arrived at khartoum he found the situation more desperate than the force at his command could master knowing the country and its people better than most englishmen he decided to use diplomacy after the collapse of his illadvised attempts to bring the exslave trader zobeir pasha to his assistance he finally had to deal directly with the mahdi gordon offered to make the mahdi governorgeneral of a large province the mighty mahdi interpreted this gesture as an insult and ridiculed gordon for making itthinking why should he be a mere governorgeneral of a province when the whole of the sudan except one or two places was already his in reply he urged gordon to forsake his devout christian beliefs and become a moslem to gordon this of course was unthinkable being a practical military man he knew that he did not have the power he needed to defend khartoum he sent the women and children out of the city and awaited the mahdi who arrived soon afterward and laid siege to the city after the siege had lasted many months the british sent an expedition of men under the command of lord wolsley to support general gordons army at khartoum lord wolsley whose victory over the egyptians at telekebir in was the decisive factor in establishing british rule over egypt proceeded up the nile with his expedition in boats hoping to reach general gordon before his army was overrun by the mahdis dedicated adherents at abu klea he met part of the mahdis forces and won a victory in the battle that followed while suffering heavy losses the bright memory of lord wolsleys victory barely had time to become real before his second in command general stewart was beaten and killed after weeks of hardship part of lord wolsleys expedition reached omdurman a few miles from khartoum in the journey the british ships had to sail through severe attacks by moslem krupp guns lord wolsleys success at abu klea and in bringing the expedition up the nile was a commendable feat of leadership but it did not save general gordon two days before his arrival january khartoum had fallen to the mahdis army the long day siege ended when of the mahdis fanatical army swarmed over the ramparts of the battlescarred city and surrounded the palace of governorgeneral gordon gordon a stalwart soldier to the end walked calmly out on the steps where a giant kordofan soldier follower of the mahdi ran him through with a spear an officer named nisser beheaded him with his sword hundreds of soldiers plunged their spears into his body his head was sent to the mahdi who at least admired him as a soldier and had hoped to make him a moslem convert the story of gordons attempt to save the sudan for england was all the more pathetic because his task showed every indication of failure before he set himself to it the fall of khartoum and gordons tragic end was a severe blow to english pride that might have been avoided to add to this another expedition composed of english and egyptian soldiers was defeated with great losses at kassala by the mahdis most able general osman digna general gordon had made the city of khartoum his headquarters then had been hemmed in on all sides until the city was cut off from the outside world while his supplies of food guns and ammunition were used up in a lost and hopeless cause he had stood bravely to his port trying to inspire a hundred men to do the work of thousands then being baffled and harassed by the shiftlessness and incompetency of his officers he made promises he could not keep until his word as an englishman began to fall on unlistening ears yet he inspired a listless population to resist for days then came the night attack and the father and saviour of the sudan lay dead in the midst of this chaos lord wolsley retreated to cairo with what remained of his army later bent on avenging his and englands honor he asked for a chance to attack the mahdi again and was permitted to do so he returned the same year with white troops and was beaten back now england withdrew from all of sudan except the port of suakin which could be defended by warships the mahdi prevailed over the rest of the sudan the mahdi and his forces crossed the west bank of the white nile and there in the desert laid the foundation of the capitol of his new kingdom he was now supreme master of a rich empire miles long and miles wide his subjects had been gathered from every district and tribe some gave him homage willingly some through fear the mahdis ambition was still running high he thought of himself as another mohammed he planned to bring all adjoining territories under his rule subdue the christian part of ethiopia march into egypt and convert the world to islam his amazing career ended before any of these dreams were realized on june six months after the death of general gordon he died of typhoid fever with his last strength he shouted the islam creed his followers mourned him for months and later erected a magnificent tomb on the spot where he died the mahdi was succeeded by his second in command khalifa abdullahi who ruled the country for troublesome years before the british gave lord kitchener enough men to reconquer the sudan in avenging what he thought was englands honor lord kitchener showed no mercy and considered nothing to be sacred while he was accomplishing his mission he more than earned the title the butcher of omdurman he bombarded the tomb of the mahdi took his bones and threw them into the nile it was said that mahdis head was packed in a kerosene tin and later used by kitchener as a tobacco container in spite of lord kitchener and those who came after him the followers of the mahdi continued to fight the british until about in the many books and papers written about him the mahdi became a romantic hero in the eyes of some of the englishmen who had fought him in his introduction to the book the mahdi of allah by richard a bermann the late winston churchill said the life of the mahdi is a romance in miniature and wonderful as that of mohammed himself the rebellion of the sudan was the last great outburst of the bloodred flower of islam the mahdi and his caliphate might well have endured to today and developed as stately a power as the moors in spain as for the unanswered questionwas muhammad ahmad the mahdi really a messiah well millions of people in the sudan believed he was and some still do but let this truth suffice the mahdi and his successors were rightfully fighting against injustice and colonial misrule among other reasons the aftermath of this fight moved the british to adopt a more humane and enlightened administration in the sudan this policy eventually helped to make the sudan the free and independent country we know today he occasion a historic t one was the consecration of most rev harold perry a negro in new orleans as the procession of prelates and priests filed through the entrance of the stately basilica of st louis king of france an onlooker muttered to his companion next thing you know these catholics will be having a colored pope a man of such obviously discriminating tastes deserves to be told the truth africa has given popes as well as saints and martyrs to the church so commented pope paul vi in giving his apostolic blessing to africa on the occasion of the canonization of the martyrs of uganda the negro popes referred to by the present holy father were victor i melchiades and gelasius all three are honored in the church as saints at least one of them victor was a martyr for the faith each contributed mightily to the development of the church in the crucial centuries following its foundation victor a native african became pope in the year and reigned for years in church history he invariably gets honorable mention for his part in settling the controversy then raging in rome on the matter of when the pivotal feast of easter should be celebrated at that time a large colony of asiatic christians lived in rome the exile asians observed easter with great pomp and ceremony as well as with feasting while the christians of rome were still subject to the rigors of lent victor called for conformity concerning easter throughout the church when the bishops of asia minor proved reluctant to change their traditional time of observance pope victor promptly excommunicated them and despite appeals from the west on their behalf stuck fast for several years to the sentence he had pronounced nor did he relent until the observance of easter on the sunday immediately following the forty days of lent was universal though the easter controversy would arise in a new form in later times when the church had spread to the british isles it was settled for all of what was christendom in his day by the vigorous victor ever efficient and methodical pope victor called the first roman synod of history he also declared latin the official language of the church despite the evergrowing use of the vernacular in church functions today this decree is still in effect so meticulous was pope victor in his guardianship of morals that he is credited with writing a treatise on the evils of playing dice less elegantly known in modern times as shooting craps his only extant writings however deal exclusively with the easter controversy pope victor was the scourge of the heretics of his era most aggressive were the gnostics but victor faced them fearlessly he also tackled theodotus a leather goods merchant who denied the divinity of christ he excommunicated the impious heretic blastus with a name like that he was simply asking for it for himself and his followers during the pontificate of pope victor the emperors persecution of the christians was suspended due to the intercession of marcia an influential lady of the imperial household when victor gave marcia a list of the christians who had been sentenced to slavery in the sardinian mines she arranged for their release pope victor effectively took advantage of the period of peace to advance the cause of the still small and struggling christian church his great contribution to christianity was achieved by his vigorous pronouncements by the power of his pen st jerome called him the foremost latin writer in the church and above all by his benign personality which won him universal respectpope victor i died a martyr in the year his burial place was close to that of st peter apostle and first martyrpope july th is the feastday of pope st victor the next negro to occupy the chair of peter was melchiades of africa also known as miltiades or milziadus prior to his accession the church had been considerably weakened by imperial persecution and by internal strife his immediate predecessors popes marcellus and eusebius had both been deposed and sent into exile after the death of eusebius in sicily there followed two years of turmoil and confusion during which the papal throne remained vacant when miltiades was elected pope in he faced a formidable task soon however the policy of persecuting the christians was abandoned in both east and west and after the accession of constantine as emperor the church finally emerged from the catacombs pope miltiades set out to salvage and to reconstruct the battered and broken bark of peter in this he proved to be a willing and skillful craftsman in the lateran palace restored to christian possession by the wife of constantine miltiades presided over a synod of bishops most important item on the agenda was a discussion on the state of the church in africa where a heretic donatus had done much damage by his intrigues donatus was condemned by the synod and once again matters ecclesiastical flourished duce the to pro in africa soon great augustine writing of his fellowcountryman st augustine referred to pope miltiades as an excellent pontiffthough his rule of the church was of short duration about four years miltiades accomplished much for the church he provided the strong leadership required in a time of transition pope miltiades died in significantly he who had arranged an honorable burial for his exiled predecessor eusebius was by his own wishes it would seem buried in the same cemetery area of the catacombs the cemetery of st calixtus they were the last popes to be interred in the catacombs the feastday of pope st miltiades is december the third negro pope was st gelasius born in rome of african parents and member of the roman diocesan clergy at the time of his election to the papacy the eastern church with headquarters at constantinople was in schism from rome euphemius patriarch of constantinople returned to the faith but refused to consider his former associate acacius a heretic gelasius made it clear that he would not restore euphemius to the full honors of the patriarchate till the diptych honoring acacius was removed from the walls of constantinoples principal church encountering obstinacy on the part of euphemius pope gelasius stood firm in reply to appeals from bishops of the west the pope pointed out that his attitude toward euphemius was not a personal matter but one of principle pope gelasius resented imperial interference in ecclesiastical matters in a letter to the emperor anastasius the pope defined the functions of church and state and pointed out that the ideal relationship between them was that they should be ancillary and not antagonistic to each other this letter is still frequently quoted when churchstate controversies arise possibly as a result of this widely hailed letter pope gelasius enjoyed a friendlier relationship with emperor theodoric the successor of anastasius many of his own roman flock caused grief to the heart of the good gelasius by their return to superstitious practices particularly in connection with the revived pagan festival of lupercal gelasius condemned christian participation in the rites particularly those associated with fertility it would seem however that some of the more innocent customs were permitted to continue and to this toleration we most likely owe the sentimental observance of st valentines day a feature of the lupercalia held at mid february was the relatively harmless juno februata this part of the celebration centered on a drawing of names for the purpose of matrimonial matchmaking the practice some say was christianized by associating it with the feast of st valentine which coincided with the date of juno februata in any case pope gelasius was successful in restoring the superstitious dissidents to the integrity of the faith his writings reveal that he was a man of deep learning the letter to emperor anastasius on church and state establishes him as the first political science writer of christianity in addition he was an authority on the matter of papal infallibility as a liturgist he left his mark by introducing better order more beauty and added stateliness into church services pope gelasius led a humble prayerful and ascetical life just and charitable to all he was especially considerate of the poor dionysius exiguus th century scholar wrote of pope gelasius that he was more a servant than a sovereign the great gelasius died in his feast is observed on november the christians of roman africa comprising the communities of tripoli algeria and morocco contributed greatly to the strength and growth of the church in the first five centuries despite occasional heresy and almost constant contro versy by however the church was virtually extinct in africa because of the inroads of the vandals soon followed by the savage mohammedan conquest the moslem territory of north africa has remained closed to christianity ever since missionary efforts in central and southern africa however have been remarkably successful in modern times the first negro bishop afterwards archbishop of the new christian era in africa was most rev joseph kiwanuka when pope pius xii consecrated him in rome on may th the holy father made it clear that the appointment of africans as bishops was no mere gesture of goodwill or a benign nod to native aspirations in you pope pius said i reestablish the african hierarchy which was interrupted by the invasion of the vandals centuries ago you must work very hard because it is by your success that i shall judge whether or not i should appoint new african bishops while attending the recent council sessions archbishop kiwanuka could look around the conclave and see two african cardinals and more than african bishops back home in africa were million catholics and an everincreasing native clergy and sisterhood africas major seminaries and minor seminaries were engaged in training the more than african candidates for the priesthood while still other native sons pursued their studies at rome and at various european seminaries all this was achieved in a relatively short period of ecclesiastical history the man who symbolizes the remark able african catholic progress of his era archbishop kiwanuka died in march of having served his people for more than years as parish priest seminary professor bishop and finally archbishop the blood of martyrs being the seed of christians it is not surprising that in uganda where lay african catholics were martyred years ago there are now two million catholics in a total population of seven million in our own day the martyrdom of priests brothers and sisters in the congo representing religious communities and nationalities testifies to the intrepid apostolic thrust in modern africa and promises an even greater growth of catholicism on the continent a new era of missionary activity is about to begin in africa declared cardinal laurian rugambwa africas distinguished first cardinal speaking at a symposium in dublin ireland recently though only a small percentage of negroes in the united states are catholic they presently are represented in the episcopate by the auxiliary bishop of new orleans his excellency bishop perry a negro prior was elected in by the community of st maurs abbey in kentucky conversions to catholicism among the negroes of the u s amount to about a year the number of negro priests and sisters is advancing steadily the growing prestige among the catholic negroes of the world may well develop to the point where it will produce popes for the universal church once more though that muttering man in new orleans betrayed such a limited knowledge of church history his forecast of the future seems very well founded indeed last november edward w brooke then attorney general of the commonwealth of massachusetts was elected to the s senate as a republican and became the first known negro u s senator since when blanche kelso bruce of mississippi left the upper house of congress mr brooke took his seat in the senate in january becoming the third known negro to occupy a seat in the us senate the other senator being hiram revels like his distinguished predecessors mr brooke brings background of superior education and accomplishment all three graduated from college and one revels was a college president it might be useful here to point out that contrary to the myth established and perpetuated by southernsympathizing writers and historians the negroes who served in the us congress were far from the illiterate this christ shamed us by his pigmentation so obviously not our own he condemned us for our blackness for our flat noses for our kinky hair for our power our strange power of expressing emotion in singing and shouting and dancing he was sedate so genteel so white and as soon as we were able many of us tried to be like him for a growing number of bold young black people all that is past they fling out their declaration no white christ shall shame us again we are glad to be black we rejoice in the darkness of our skin we celebrate the natural texture of our hair we extol the rhythm and vigor of our songs and shouts and dances and if your american christ doesnt like that you know what you can do with him that is black_power a repudiation of the american culturereligion that helped to create it and a quest for a religious reality more faithful to our own experience these young people say to america we know your christ and his attitude toward africa we remember how his white missionaries warned against africas darkness and heathenism against its savagery and naked jungle heart we are tired of all that this africa that you love and hate but mostly fearthis is our homeland we saw you exchange your bibles for our land we watched you pass out tracts and take in gold we heard you teach hymns to get our diamonds and you control them still if this is what your christ taught you he is sharp baby he is shrewd but hes no savior of ours we affirm our homeland and its great black past a past that was filled with wonder before your white scourge came you can keep your christ well take our home that is black_power a search for roots in a land that has denied us both a past and a future and the american christ who has blessed the denial earns nothing but scorn from black_power and the american christ by vincent harding in the christian century janet stevensons novel sisters and brothers crown records a situation common in the united states where miscegenation is so far advanced that the majority of its black population are brown yellow or white in complexion today so many white negroes have passed into the white race that it would not be surprising if some of our most virulent congressmen governors ku kluxers or white citizens councilmen were discovered to have negro blood like the ku klux klan official who recently committed suicide when his jewish identity was disclosed the difference in this book which is based on the history of an actual family is that the family acknowledges their negro relatives angelina and sarah grimke sisters of a charleston south carolina slaveholding family were so opposed to slavery that they joined the quakers moved to the north and engaged in antislavery agitation after the civil war they discover they have two negro nephews attending lincoln university in pennsylvania the book tells how the white and the black members of the family finally come together with many flashbacks to the previous experiences of the sisters and the boys janet stevenson has done her research well in the negro caravan edited by brown davis and lee theres an article by angelina weld grimke the daughter of one of the boys in the novel which describes her grandmother her father and her uncles and the novel is true to her descriptions her father archibald grimke became a lawyer an author and a distinguished negro leader who won a spingarn medal she herself was a poet whose poems are included in the negro caravan and other anthologies one troubling thing about thnovel is that janet stevenson seems to have an ambivalent attitude toward her characters such epithets as evil or rignteous applied to men or conduct might have been apropos in a writer of harriet beecher stowes time now after freuds revelations of the dubious motivation of seemingly virtuous actions such epithets have a connotation of scorn disapprobation or satire when used by or about the characters the abolitionists have been too long maligned by biased writers and historians historian david donald sneers at abolitionist charles sumner claude bowers is horrified at white northerners who went south and treated negroes like equal human beings fictionists like margaret mitchell romanticize the old south an act comparable to calling dachau a summer resort yes the planters had a good time so did the s s men actually the abolitionists could have enjoyed all the privileges of the dominant race in america but in undertaking the antislavery fight they faced hostility ostracism mobs and death negro slaves showed what the south was really like by their acts of resistance by malingering lying stealing sabotage running away poisoning arson mutiny and armed revolt which were necessary means of defense against men who had all the law and the power on their side and who presumed to buy sell beat maim torture and murder them aside from her nuances of language which imply a disparaging attitude toward her abolitionist characters janet stevensons novel is wellwritten the many flashbacks do not obtrude as technical devices they immediately engulf the reader in the past make vivid the hazards faced by the abolitionists the slaves and free negroes and explain and intensify the emotion of the present from the beginning of the story the reader anticipates a confrontation between the white and the black grimkes mrs stevenson heightens suspense by delaying the scene until near the end of the book the readers interest is held and his suspense tautened until the last word of the last page the new revised edition of barrons profiles of american colleges barrons educational series soft cover is billed as the equivalent of a personal visit to each campus compiled by benjamin fine the former education editor of the new york times the book is comprehensive and concise the colleges and universities are listed according to states and the quality and effectiveness of the school curriculum can be judged from the objective information supplied in his introduction mr fine sets up an example by which students seeking a college may appraise themselves and their needs and possibilities he also offers advice on selecting the appropriate school and directs the student in making a decision there is information relative to methods of paying for an education there also is a brief bibliography of further reading materials for the interested person a thoroughly useful guide it has some pages and includes an index it was ridiculous to i have an issue of such an insipidly written magazine in the apartment he knew nevertheless he picked it up again and began to read the article written about himself the audacity of it and the incredible and insane arrogance it suggested made him feel helpless against the terrible tide of consciousness so established and so knowledgeable to him and to his people his brains were sealed signed for and delivered like his body would have been in the previous century he focused his eyes and finished the article his black hands and black eyes drooping wearily over the side of the plush gold sofa then he lay down upon it keeping his shoes on it was not very comforting at all the article stated clearly that his childhood dream had been to pursue and to possess a blonde goddess that he could never be happy without her it made fun of a black entertainer he had dated it said he paid her to give him his freedom there was no picture of her but there was a listing and pictures of national and international ladies with fair hair to whom he had been linked romantically at one time or another there was a picture of him with his wifehis wife bright and grinning and his teeth matching her fairness kilometer for kilometer his hair was falling into his eyes it always seemed to be falling into his eyes whenever he was playing golf or driving or dancing or singing and he always had to toss his head give his neck a quick snappy jerk in order to keep his tumbling hair neat it always got into his eyes he bent over to light a cigarette the hair fell into his eyes he used his free hand to brush it back knowing that it would tumble into his eyes again his wife entered the room she was very very white he had asked her to stay out of the sun and the black maid entered with a tray of beverages the children liked the maid and his wife liked the maid he hated her she was almost as black as himself and her hair was short he always felt like singing an old downhome blues whenever he saw her i dont want no woman if her hair aint no longern mine she aint nothing but trouble and keep you worried all the time but no matter how much hatred he showed towards her the woman was always kind and serene yet there was the very faintest hint of laughter and incredible mockery in her eyes when she looked at him he knew the look he himself had given it to others many times he remembered the party in greenwich village the interracial party with all the loud music and the loud dancing which belonged to a younger time than now l j there was a colored girl there he was told but all the girls looked of the same race because there was not the brightest lighting still he thought that he would know a sapphire if he saw one the girls white date had laughed at him for saying this and slapped him on the back he had felt so clever so able to take it so free so optimistic so in and that was when he knew that he could make it if he chose to make it in the big world of the american dream and this world as he knew it was not white it was a grey world with room in it for all the people he felt so in that he almost blessed emma lazarus a group of them were laughingly trying to sing a foolish ditty with dirty words they were all so happy and drunk and there was a girl whose hands kept going to her temple and down behind her ears with long locks of hair which she pushed over her shoulder then she would toss her hair or attempt to but the long hair barely moved the long strands did not move freely they seemed waxen stuck around her face like fetters his hands went to his own head in sudden dirision and stuck in the dixie peach the girl swung her head again and caught his eyes he looked into her eyes as deeply as he could and his bitterness spilled like a white sizzle across to her in mockery and despair and a tender compassionate hatred the boy who had slapped him on the back moved toward the girl caught her by the hand and began to dance with her his hips swaying brutally ungraceful in mocknegro he went to the window dawn was moving up to the river and over the roofs it was time for him to go he knew that he would never go to another party with a negro no matter what color the negro wasthey were all embarrassing he might go if he were the only one only if he were jc he knew that his wife somehow resulted from this promise which he had made to himself a long time ago at the village party he had come a long way his name his picture his life were on the lips and the lifesized posters of the world subway bums whores and dogs could lean against his photograph in most of the worlds swinging cities and he was very wealthy he had his own entourage of

another million melanin and millions millions and melanin numbly he moved about the dressing room larger than his parents living room had been mutely he dressed dejectedly he faced himself in the mirror silently the green gall of selfrevulsion passed through his psyche and soul swiftly he recalled the chance to make a million and the wife who would spend it on furs jewels fun cosmetics and servants and the whole world would see what black bastards with millions and melanin could do yes they would the agents smooth voice on the phone reassured him about the million there was nothing to reassure him about himself nothing nothing down the stairs voices were shrill suddenly his little girl was sobbing he heard the maid say be quiet youll wake up your mama but cathy said my daddys a

which according to them could never move him to love to cherish to desire caldonia caldonia what makes your big head so hard he remembered his boyhood and all the lyrics which laughed at and lamented black womanhood blackness black manhood black childhood black they had made the world for him had set all the traps he had been born to it the horror of blackness they had outdone themselves they had outdone him and it was not meant that he should ever be saved he must believe and they could assume postures and lies and they could believe in his selfhatred and they could rest comfortably believing that he believed and continue their believing they were so arrogant so stupefied by history and circumstances that they could accept any incredible thing they said about him terror who was the bondsman who was the freed man he knew life began to flow again his blood sang vital and red freedom power even yes i am beautiful born black born with no lack decorated bom decorated at the foot of

pushed her aside humph she said again but he got a glimpse of her face which had years of anger and defiance and hope written in chickenscratch wrinkles and crows feet and there was the mockery he always saw there and yet a kindness a laughter which was very sweet and strong and the barest hint of tears in the eyes tears like monuments to despair when he replaced the chairs and kissed his wife and child he said his goodbye to the black woman and sang a snatch of his latest recording as he walked to the elevator he felt lightweightless and yet strong and pretty i feel pretty he thought well not that kind of pretty he mocked himself but it was surprising that he sang for he had promised himself that he was only an entertainer that he wasnt your singing dancing spade that he a professional only wouldnt be caught dead drunk or straitlaced singing off the stage or away from the tv cameras or dancing like some hamhocking gigaboo nevertheless his chauffeur smiled happily when he cut a step from his latest musical sensation as he entered the limousine with the sacrilegious words i feel pretty floating cakewalking from his lips romanticists are wont to think that the pueblo de nuestra de senora de los angeles was settled by spanish grandees and caballeros sophisticated descendants of the conquisjfi tadores a close look at the record reveals however that the original founders or pobladores were a motley lot there was not a fullblooded white family among them but they were pioneer stock and with three exceptions they stayed and built the town we know today as los angeles when plans were completed for the envisioned pueblo fernando de rivera y moncada journeyed to mexico to recruit settlers for the town there after a whole year of persuading he succeeded in interesting only families or people and of that number only families or people actually made the trek majority were negroes the outfitting of the settlers took place at alamos a small town on the mexican mainland not far from the gulf of california seven of the families enlisted at rosario three at sinaloa and one at alamos the small group accompanied by an army contingent set out for their new home on feb though it is not widely known or emphasized the overwhelming majority of the founders of the pueblo de nuestra senora de los angeles were catholics of negro racial strain of those pobladores ultimately arriving at the projected site the only people of unmixed caucasian race in the whole community were two spanish men the settlers who represented a mixture of indian and negro with here and there a trace of spanish can be broken down into four racial strainsintermarriage among the latin american natives and europeans produced a multitude of castes children of an indian mother in an indiancaucasian union are considered mestizos whereas those of a negro mother in a negroindian union are classified as mulattos by this enumeration the founders of los angeles wereif these statistics prove nothing else at least they dispel any notion that there were any blueblooded spanish dons among the catholics who pioneered the city of the angels quite the contrary is the case for there were more negroes among the founders of los angeles than any other racial group and a realization of this factor useful for the social historian confirms that these noble pobladores sprang from hardy stock and the blood of true pioneers coursed through their veins ne of the virtues of margaret walkers long pages first novel jubilee houghton mifflin is its angle of vision the story of vyry the novels heroine is told from the negro viewpoint and since the period covered in the novel spans the years just prior to and just after the civil war this viewpoint alone is a novelty most of the vast catalogue of novels about that period of american history have treated black charactersif at allas animate furniture in the background of the swashbuckling lives of white men and women drawn twice their natural size it should be stated at the outset that jubilee does not turn the traditional civil war novel upsidedown or insideout in approach in insight and in its tone it clings to the familiar in fact jubilee flings aside one of the brighter robes of the traditional civil war novel it is almost totally lacking in romance but perhaps this fact was dictated by the novelists choice of heroine vyry miss walker informs us in a brief dedication in the book was actually margaret duggans ware brown the authors maternal greatgrandmother and it is possible that the sheer weight of the actual and of the need to keep within the bounds of careful research and credibility served to rob the narrative of romance in many ways vyrys story is the saga of the negros long hard bitter travail in this land she was born a slave and when mr lincolns eman cipation came she journeyed forth into a hostile world where those who had been her masters still ruled determined that emancipation notwithstanding black people would never stand equal beside them vyry is not of course the negro woman of her era to begin with she is the child of her master born to sis hetta the frail concubine of marse dutton at sis hetta died in childbirth having given marse dutton slaves for his fields and kitchens vyry grows up as a house nigger despised by her masters wife and ignored by her masterfather she is the particular servant of miss lillian who also is her sister the arrangement of course was far more common during those days than historians find it comfortable to admit love never comes to vyry sex does randall ware the coalblack free black man in dawson ga the town nearest the dutton plantations comes acourting and two children jim and minnaare born of that union ware though a prosperous blacksmith cannot purchase vyrys freedom and his one effort to lead her to freedom by way of the underground railroad is thwarted for her efforts vyry is beaten and lashed into unconsciousness but vyry is a true house nigger having assumed all the airs and prejudices of her calling and she has little taste for daring the war breaks out and ware goes north to offer his services to the invading yankee armies marse dutton dies and both the dutton son and soninlaw die in the fighting the ruin of the dutton family is complete when old missy dies and miss lillian following an assault by men in shermans army goes off her rocker faithful vyry stands by her demented mistress until relatives arrive from alabama to take the unfortu nate woman and her two children away then vyry marries innis brown a black man who turned up with shermans troops and stayed as her suitor after all randall ware has been away seven years and vyry has waited for him in vain now wed vyry and her family begin their trek across the rural south seeking a place to settle where the rampaging ku klux klan will let them live in peace all the forces of nature and bigotry contrive against them they are flooded out of one home exploited into poverty in another and burned out of a third finally in alabama vyry wins respect as a midwife and the whites permit her and her family to go their way then finally randall ware shows up again prosperous and forgiving providing for the education of his two children the book ends on this note it would be a pleasure to report that jubilee is the longawaited novel which tells the black mans story of that crucial period of conflict over slavery in this land but such unhappily is not the case miss walker has failed in her reach for the epic novel she has even failed to write a very interesting novel which is worse in the authors favor it might be said that she was overwhelmed by her material from a mass of information and history it was her task to weave a background for the story of vyry brown so much of that story is told in language that is surprisingly banal for a poet of miss walkers reputation and none of the sweep and turbulence of the civil war is captured or even suggested in her style the novel reads as though the author felt that her first duty was to provide the everyday details of vyrys life that in performing this duty the vast panorama of history would fall into place behind
curious aspect of cp i q the struggle of black i people in america for a human rights is that generally we have assumed that economic exploitation and racism are one and the same thing they are not for instance the system of bondservitude which existed in america within the white race was a system of exploitation but not of racism and in europe animosity between the french and the germans could be termed racism but there is now no exploitation involved very often racism and exploitation are found in the same place at the same timeas in todays americabut a study of history will show that in most cases the exploitation of a race or nation began first and was then followed by a racist doctrine which rationalized that exploitation the spanish did not invade the south america of the nonwhite incas because they were racists but because they wanted the wealth of what was so pompously called the new world the slave traders of europe would not have bothered to invade africa in the name of racism alone the white world needed a source of cheap labor and raw materials in both cases and to varying degrees racism came later even so most of our leaders continue to treat the two facts of the life of black people in america as one and as a matter of fact attack racism more vehemently than they do economic exploitation what other reason exists why our leaders do not call for a nationwide boycott of all luxury products for black people to buy the necessities of life only from blackowned stores to boycott christmas itself in all but the spiritual and religious sense to boycott the automobile industry for a year or more or to form societies just as have the chinese to buy land and to open businesses it is because most of our leaders believe that if we can force the white man to give up his racism he will automatically cease to exploit us this is a ridiculous idea who is more exploited than a white mississippi who dies in vietnam defending an economic system that has given him nothing but a substandard education a sharecrop farm cheap clothes and too little to eat to the true exploiter of american society the big white man race means nothing he exploits his own as quickly and with no more conscience than he exploits black people but still our leaders accept the idea that racism and exploitation are the sameor worse that racism is the greater evil and to the extent that they accept this idea they have accepted the white mans definition of the black mans problem the big white man is no doubt very pleased about this he is very content to allow the black man to look after his eternal soul or to attack it just as long as the black man leaves his purse alone a perfect example of the confusion between racism and economic exploitation is our relationship with the white liberal especially in our condemnations of him i have read a good many of these by people of varying degrees of anger boiled down they state in effect that the white liberals liberalism is insincere that he helps us because he is inadequate in the white world and believing us to be inferior feels that he will be more than adequate in the black world or that he is a man who is racked by guilt over his racism and hopes not to face his true nature by throwing himself into the black mans struggle or finally that he is a big white man who has been exploiting black people as slum landlord or seller of inferior merchandise and gives his money for his consciences sake the last is one of the few valid condemnations but it should not be made our leaders should accept his money and use it to finance the black struggle but all the rest those in which not money but only the white liberals work in our behalf though actually on a superficial levelmiss the main point they assume that good white liberals do exist people who truly want to integrate black people into american society or who want to obliterate all consciousness of race in both the black and white man very seldom do these condemnations deal with the white liberals true feelings on exploitation the white liberal tells us that he is opposed to the exploitation of black people and we assume that he is opposed to all forms of exploitation in most cases he is not beware of the man who opposes only certain forms of exploitation as i have said the big white man does not care about the race of the people he exploits he is realistic is committed mainly to keeping things as they are change itself is his worst enemysince change means that he must make adjustments in his economic behavior that he must take risks notice for example how the stock market is effected by the change of presidents in the same way any change in the situation of black people either for better or worse would call for a corresponding change by the big white man to balance our attempts to bring about change the big white man uses americas white lowerclass some of them avowed racists who at worst call openly for our destruction and at least for a continuance of our present condition but at heart the lowerclass white has only so much power as the big white man gives him from time to time to retard our progress however committed to keeping things as they are the big white man does not allow the lowerclass white to go as far as he wants this may not always be so as more and more of the nonwhite world takes back the land and resources the big white man in europe and america has controlled for the last several hundred years and as automation diminishes the need for cheap labor the big white man will have to cut production the day is coming when he will no longer need black people to produce or to consume but for the time being we are safe he needs us all black man and lowerclass white most of our leaders believe that the lowerclass white is our worst enemy but at very least his racism does not involve any great exploitation of us and does not grow out of his whiteness as our angrier leaders believe but rather out of his competition with us within the american economy his fear is not that we will rape or worse marry his daughter but that we will take his job it is not even our concern tht he feels us to be ineror as a matter of fact it has worked to our advantage and will continue to do so a man who thinks his enemy is inferior is very likely to underestimate his enemys power and determination his supposed superiority will disarm him at this point we must see how the white liberal fits into this pattern he is not usually a white of the lowerclass but of the middleclass to some extent this explains why he does not ally himself with the lowerclass white within the white world he must stay on the good side of the big white man for he hopes one day to be one himself basically he joins us not because he is committed to equality but because the lowerclass white is the one who most threatens his middleclass position in white american society the fight against racism supplies an outlet for his liberalism necessary to his belief in the american system within which he or his father has achieved middleclass membership at the same time he protects himself against the rise of the lowerclass white at least one of his many beliefs which he must maintain to justify his wanting to join the big white man is that the big white man is ignorant of his exploitation of black people the big white man he tells us is sensitive intelligent moral and honest despite these qualities he does not know what he has done to black people in america for the last years as soon as he does know he will stop but a system of exploitation as refined and efficient as americas is certainly not the product of generations of ignorant men all the above would seem enough for us to handle for a long time if our leaders saw the situation as one of economic exploitation and formulated plans for us which would attack the weaknesses in the economic system but unfortunately they see the situation as one of racism and by assuming this our leaders accept the doctrine of white supremacy have i gone too far let us look for example at the black integrationist doesnt he instruct the black man to integrate himself economically socially and psychologically into american society in terms of economic integration just as he is now the black man is already integrated into the american economy which benefits from him as a consumer and when he can find a job as a worker even when he is not working he is used as a threat against the white worker thus within the economy the black man has a very definite function the black integrationist is not talking about true social integration either since he does not call for a total mixture of the races to create a new nonwhite race thus he is talking only about psychological integration but he is not calling upon the white man to become either totally or in part psychologically black he is calling upon the black man to become totally or partially white but as long as he is black the black man cannot become psychologically white his black skin gives him a set of experiences which will continue to make him black psychologically by calling upon the black man to integrate himself into american society the black integrationist can only mean that despite his black skin and his black experience the black man must become as white and as american as possible he is also asking the black man to ignore and renounce all that has and will happen to him until the day of total integration in order to do this the black man must ignore his total experience since with black skin he has had no white experience a man is his total experience to renounce it is to renounce himself totally why does the black integrationist call upon the black man to make this sacrifice so that he might be integrated totally into and be treated as a human member of american society the black integrationist then can only mean that to the extent that he is black the black man is not a human being and at most because of his black skin he can never be more than almost human if this is not white supremacy what indeed is white supremacy even most of our angrier leaders are white supremacists they begin from the premise that the white man is evil not because he exploits black people but because he is white they reason to be white is to be evil whiteness breeds racism which leads to exploitation therefore they ask us to separate ourselves from the evil of whiteness which will free us from the white mans exploitation this is a little better for it senses that the black man can best alleviate exploitation by remaining separated from american society but because their argument is directed against whiteness itself instead of exploitation it still leads to an acceptance of white supremacy for if the white man is evil because he is white his power over us must flow from his whiteness it follows he was able to dominate and exploit us because of the power of whiteness thus our very blackness is responsible for our condition it could not stand up to the evil power of whiteness if we separate from himthat is if we do not try to weaken the power of his whiteness with our blacknesshe will continue to be able to exploit us for the power of his whiteness is undiminished doesnt such an argument support the doctrine of white supremacy separation is indeed the answer not to flee the evil of whiteness but to create an economic unit which can bring an end to exploitation suppose for example the tenants of a slumbuilding in harlem formed a corporation to buy the building in which they lived then suppose more and more tenements were bought by the black people who lived in them until all of the buildings in harlem were owned by the people of harlem manhattan island is the most important island in the world harlem is almost half of manhattan island what if black people owned half of the most important island in the world and still most of our leaders and the majority of black people are committed to the integration movement and accept with that commitment the doctrine of white supremacy still the majority of black people trust the white liberal and even in their condemnations of him emphasize his whiteness or his hidden racism still the majority of black people accept the idea that even though some white liberals are insincere there do exist some good white liberals there is no such thing as a good white liberalnot because of the evil of whiteness but because of the evil of the concept of liberalism itself malcolm_x once said of all our studies history is best qualified to reward our research in order to understand the evil of liberalism we must find where it has appeared before and what were its end results we must find a people whose situation was similar to ours and see what happened to them at the hand of liberalism within the last years there has been such a people the jews of germany during the nazi era i realize that by introducing the inflammatory issue of the jewish people i risk being misunderstood very often our leaders are asked if black people are antisemitic they have a hard time answering because antisemitism is a racist concept fighting racism they hate to admit they themselves are racist but again the relationship of jews to black people is primarily not one of racism but of exploitation in america there is a pecking order of exploitation the big white man exploits both jew and middleclass white manindeed everybody the middleclass white man exploits the lowerclass white man in the black ghetto the jew tends to be the one who exploits the black man so in raising the question of the jew in germany it is important that we understand that the comparison is drawn in terms of exploitation not in terms of racism though racism as we will see certainly appears for centuries the jews of europe and particularly of germany had been victims of exploitation and racism even so they were allowed to function within the economy of europe the rothchilds come to mind but not until the nazi era did germany and europe adopt the policy of geno cide the extermination of the jewish race and it is an interesting and important historical fact that the nazism in germany grew not out of the monarchy of kaiser wilhelm but instead from the most liberal government germany ever had the german republic it took only years from the time of its formation in for hitler to rise through the legislative process to the chancellorship of the republic that this could happen within a liberal framework points to the evil of the liberal concept itself which is irrational despite all racial religious cultural and physical differences all men are the same for the german liberal this meant that even though the jew was a jew under his jewishness he was a german the german liberal was thus committed to the creation of a society in which the jews germanity could emerge but the jews jewishness was a fact not as is black skin besides most jews did not want to give up their jewishness beyond this the jews jewishness just as the black mans skin gave him a set of experiences which continued to make him jewish and to the same extent nongerman thus the jew by daring to want to remain a jew in fact by being jewish was the main obstacle to a liberal germany at this point the german liberal had to make a crucial decision he could either accept the jew as a jew not as a german with certain jewish characteristics and abandon his dream of a society where all men were completely german or he could continue to pursue his dream but a close look at the german liberal reveals that he was not committed to integrating jews into german society as much as he was committed to the ideal of uniformity such dreams die hard the german liberal frustrated in his attempts to germanize the jew saw the salvation of his dream of uniformity in hitlers call for the extermination of the jews only when there were no more jews would everybody be truly german the german liberal cast his lot with hitler all situations have an economic base in this case the real exploiters of germany were pleased by this development their power was being threatened by the lowerclass german who was calling for an end to his exploitation and was joining the communists in great numbers in germany the liberal helped to redirect the mind of the lowerclass german away from his own exploitation the jew became a scapegoat for the misery of the lowerclass german i need only add that the german republic was formed after germany had lost world war one which brought on the collapse of the german economy i trust i do not have to draw out the comparison to great lengths clearly the white liberal committed to the dream of american uniformity does not accept the black man as he is we cannot risk discovering what he will do when he finds out that his dream cannot be made a reality as long as black people exist in america one more thing at this time america is fighting a war which it cannot seem to win decisively and which if lost will bring about drastic changes with which the big white man will have to deal earlier i quoted malcolm_x on the value of studying history i did not give the quotation fully in the next breath he continued and when you see that youve got a problem all you have to do is examine the historic method used all over the world by others who have problems similar to yours i think malcolm_x would have also taught us that even before we can discover what other people did about their problems we must first be certain we know the true nature of our own problem and that while we look for the solution we should be careful to avoid the mistakes made by people who faced similar problems especially at the end of his life malcolm_x knew all of this i think that is why returning from mecca he told us that he no longer believed our problem to be solely one of race but of human rights and of exploitation it would be a great shame now that he is dead if we moved backwards from the point to which at times very much against our will he had pushed us in february the southern college students took matters i q into their own hands changing the nature of civil_rights strategy since then the civil_rights question has been a g major domestic concern in the united states and headline news throughout the world sympathizers with the civil_rights movement have generally been impressed by the concept of a moral cause which has given rise to a modern great crusade theirs has been the sublime conviction of eventual victory so much so that they have paid little attention to the course and direction of the everyday struggle examination of the current situation however reveals that despite the marches large and small despite the sitins wadeins and other nonviolent protest demonstrations despite the considerable toll of human sacrificethe civil_rights revolt is in mortal danger in fact the civil_rights revolt is well on its way to defeat through the first two phases of the revolt february to the march on washington august and the second phase the counterrevolution august to the present the civil righters have been severely crippled by three primary weaknesses which have contributed to their present difficulty i the civil righters have never known the nature of the problem nor the nature of the enemy ii the civil righters have lacked the necessary institutions and apparatus to achieve their objective iii the civil righters have not projected a clear view either of the society as it is or the society as it ought to be any single one of these weaknesses would be enough to frustrate any reform attempt with these three basic weaknesses the civil_rights reform movement is doomed to isolation frustration and annihilation the moderate civil righters will settle for tokens as they always have the conservative civil righters will have to be happy with status without substance while the tactics of the civil righters have been dramatic their tactics have essentially depended on the open bestiality and blind stupidity of sheriffs state troopers and elected officials to this date the civil righters have not developed and in some instances have not wished to develop a stable disciplined massbased power organization determined to deal with the problems of the black people of this land the past two years have merely borne out the accuracy of joseph p lyfords observation that the term revolution or revolt when applied to the current efforts of the negro middleclass to secure rights and privileges commensurate with their class status has been a serious misnomer without doubt the negro middleclass has dominated much of the current effort and has disguised its class goals to give the appearance that its efforts were racial in nature rather than class oriented at best these valiant efforts are a conservative reform movement a reform whose goals are pictured in terms of the verbalized but not the actual creed of the society in attempting such a class reform under the guise of racial reform the leaders and followers of this movement have indicated that they understand neither the racial problem nor the nature of the society for the past years scholars have been suggesting that the race problem in america is a special type of the ageold colonial problem and as such is a racial problem that is a problem at the root of the society the problem is a hybrid outgrowth of both the basic european bourgeois racist attitude of contempt and the societys own organizational and industrial structure in contrast to this view the negro bourgeoisie conservative by training and conditioning has insisted through most of its recent history that the racial problems of the united states are purely a domestic issue this class has looked for the explanation of the behaviour and motivation of the dominant white society in every directionsave economic and cultural premises assumptions of europe and europeans the struggle of this class against racist exploitation has now developed into a fight against individual bigotry and intolerance blinded by this basic fallacy and misled in their beliefs that there was a possibility of even political equality under the present system the negro middleclass has tried to peddle the idea that the white middleclass was in favor of rights for negroes this lack of a realistic modern orientation has brought profoundly limiting consequences the reformers insist on the passage of legalistic but generally unenforceable regulations they are overly concerned with the maintenance of a good image rather than the attainment of solid objectives and are forever calling upon the federal government to intervene on behalf of black citizens in trouble civil righters particularly the more conservative ones continually issue solemn declarations of domesticity to reassure the society according to these declarations negroes will maintain their nonviolent posture and not look anywhere in the world for insight information and support recently roy wilkins executive secretary of the naacp issued such a statement when he said that the naacp was opposed to the peace demonstration to be held august mr wilkins stated that naacp was opposed because the official word is that there will be a civil disobedience attempt to crash into the white house and another attempt to occupy the chamber and desks of the house of representatives he and his organization would not be party to such a thing in effect the older line groups have been thwarting the development of the civil_rights cause by keeping the struggle isolated to one single issue the younger more radical civil righters as well have been affected by this kind of thinking or nonthinking many of these young people want a quick decision since their cause is right and they have exposed the cancerous nature of societys inner life b the people the leadership and followers of the civil_rights cause generally do not understand the mass of white society since the civil righters and the negro middleclass interpret their efforts as a holy crusade they were unprepared for the response that has developed since the march on washington in blinded by a deep liberal and religious tradition few have acknowledged that since october the path of the civil righters has been blocked by a veritable wall of white emotion lou harris reported that the negro ibm tabulators were unprepared surprised frightened and overwhelmed by the race hatred expressed in the responses of a representative cross section of the white population the responses were so shocking that these negro ibm tabulators threatened to resign in the midst of the mammoth task at this writing the feelings of white society have not changed appreciably in some instances the conflict has exacerbated and intensified negative feelings of whites and group activity and corporate action has replaced individual white hostility and prejudice white friends and allies of the negro struggle whether liberal or radical have unwittingly contributed to the lack of understanding of the true nature of the feelings of the overwhelming number of whites the whites who for whatever reason have sided with the negro represent a valiant but small percentage of the white group and their voices have been drowned out by the booming shouts of anger and hatred by the vast majority not only did the civil righters fail to understand the white community but they also demonstrated an appalling ignorance of the black communityits wants needs goals and aspirations the civil righters have constantly dealt in abstract ideals in religious and moral slogans without ever getting down to bread and butter issues harris and other pollsters repeatedly realize that a broad section of the negro lower class either were lying in their answers or were not even included in the tabulations the negro middleclass in the polls revealed an inexhaustible craving for acceptance and love the civil righters have attempted to convert the bulk of the population to a new set of values this attempt at conversion speaks a deeply religious motivation further it ignores the deep suffering within the black community it is misguided since this society is both driven and secular while the civil righters may continue to sing their myth of hope we shall overcome the truth is that their assessment of the attitudes of the bulk of the population was a gross miscalculation of the true feelings of the american people about basic political realities for since the birth of this nation the concept of democracy to most people has meantfor whites only in short the civil righters and their sympathizers have never known the problem or the nature of the problem they are trying to solve or the people that they are trying to convert by and large the civil righters have never questioned the values of a society which could first enslave the negro turn him loose without freeing him keep him in his place by racism and then threaten to do away with that very place by automation and technological change to call this limited reform movement a revolt or revolution is patently absurd above all else this reform essentially lacks a relevant point of view h no institutions no apparatus men pursue their goals through institutions whatever gains the civil_rights reform movement has made have been the product of maximum human spontaneity and very limited institutional apparatus since the civil_rights movement has only produced two organizations of a national character the student nonviolent coordinating committee and the northern student movement some of the civil_rights activists have shown a disenchantment and marked hostility for all structures and formal organizations preferring to substitute personal zeal and commitment for planning and group execution at times much of this type of spontaneity has almost resembled anarchy a number of strong local adhoc groups have grown and been supported but by and large the revolution has not developed any distinguished regional or national revolutionary apparatus a number of new local leaders have gained experience and prominence in leading the demonstrations yet there is still a lack of administrative skills necessary to sustain ongoing projects and programs the leaders of this society have wisely not seen fit to recognize or deal with the new activist groups instead the leaders of this society have continued to deal with the oldline civil_rights organizations whom themselves are instruments of whitepower interests this willingness on the part of the local power structures to negotiate with the oldline groups has necessarily strengthened the hand of the traditional groups like the naacp and the urban league in strengthening the position of the oldline black establishment the leaders of the society have with little effort slowed the thrust of the civil_rights forces in exchange for the recognition and money tokens of the white society the traditional negro groups and many of the moralists have been willing to continue the fiction of a moral issue and decry the use of all radical approaches to solve the racial problem a radical problem the moralists have counselled peace moderation and progress the exchange has been profitable for both partiesthe leaders of the society and the negro traditional groups fair exchange is certainly no robbery one incident of this nature occurred in the community of rochester new york the ministers of that community had brought in saul alinsky community organizer extraordinary to organize the negro community in a peaceful direction to avoid a repetition of the riots the local businessmen countered by raising to start an urban league chapter in that city the urban league is constantly praised as the ideal responsible organization no one says for whom this organization is ideal or to whom it is responsible the national urban league has become the middleclass link between the negro revolution and the white power structure and there is widespread evidence to support this claim the league function has been that of a successful mediator for which it receives the social welfare tokens of white american philanthropy in the name of racial progress on the other hand the naacp has been very ready to denounce all procedures as racial postures or radical maneuvers the city fathers of rochester were reportedly most happy to seize upon the statement of roy wilkins executive secretary of national headquarters naacp that rochester had made great strides in correcting its discriminatory practices mr wilkins in particular has been unusually responsible to the best interests of the entire american community the white power interests so zealous were his efforts that the liberator magazine interpreted his posture as indicative of racial selfhate which aided and abetted this oppressive society although the white society looks continually to the naacp and the urban league it has remained apparent for some years that neither group speaks for the rank and file of negro americans the very style of the negro establishment the unofficial name for the traditional groups exerts a tremendous pressure towards conformity and uniformity and therefore active conservatism the pronouncement of these groups have been militant but their behaviour has been conservative the battle cry of the establishment throughout the revolt is a confession of its ideological bankruptcy and programatic poverty deal with us or the radicals will take over deal with us or there will be a long hot summer these are two often heard themes not only is the style of the civil_rights groups conservative but the groups themselves are often not related to the masses it was not until the summer of that martin_luther_kings southern christian leadership conference group began work on the grassroot level sclc attempted to organize the rural inhabitants of a county in alabama and dr_king the organizations charismatic leader made a number of forays into northern urban ghettos the student nonviolent coordinating committee fortunately has had a long history of working with the people on the grassroots level other adhoc local groups have attempted to unionize the workers even the domestics and the sharecroppers the dominant oppresive society has responded with hostility to such efforts the traditional civil_rights groups are often only passingly familiar with the hopes desires and aspirations of the black people this lack of familiarity with the problems of the masses plus the apparent lack of relevant ideas gives rise to repeated cries that the negro leadership should be democratized the institutions which these undemocratized leaders head are similarly unresponsive and unimaginative the performance of the negro institutions has all but left the negro revolt without adequate institutional channels through which it can confront the dominant oppressive society without adequate channels and with slumbering and fumbling leadership of the existing apparatus negro revolt or discontent has no avenue through which it might work this lack of a workable avenue gives rise to the frequently heard question is protest to become an end in itself no clear dream or goal we shall overcome and freedom now are important slogans of the present racial efforts as inspiring and emotionally buying as these chants may be these selfsame slogans hardly hide the fact that the negro revolt as it is termed has not projected a vision of what the society is or what the society ought to be only the muslims and the nationalists to their credit have projected a dream of a better community their dream is an allblack or in some sophisticated circles a multiracial society with the borrowed concept of a profound redistribution of resources economic and political power and a rejection of the present white mass middleclass cultures corruption and hypocrisy even the view of some of the muslims or nationalists sometimes sounds more like a wish to replace white capitalism by a form of black capitalism a replacement of the uncolored decadence by a colored variety of that same poisonous social decadence the civil righters cold hard realists that they are have no dream they use a slogan instead for a dream they substitute a hodgepodge of emotional slogans and individual demands and issue disoriented protests slogans like we shall overcome and freedom now as used by the traditional civil_rights moralists hardly disguise the fact that the plans and goals projected by the civil_rights leadership are essentially colorless dreams and fantasies unrelated to the situation of the rank and file of negroes today instead the dreams are related to white middleclass liberal aspirations even the widely heralded i have a dream speech of dr martin_luther_king jr projected a goal for the american society as a whole while verbalizing the negro middleclass fantasies of integration and eventual assimilation lou harris polls of july and february revealed that to the rank and file negro the goals of the revolt were private individual hopes each hope represented the personal price for which the individual might be willing to settle when closely examined the sellout prices revolved about the consumeroriented status tokens of white middleclass society try as they might the civil_rights leaders because they didnt know where they were why they were there in the first place or where they were going wouldnt or better yet couldnt present a plan for negroes of various classes and stations the civil righters were indeed happy even grateful that the poverty program was proposed to handle some of the pressing problems of the lowerclass negro and some of the mobility problems of the negro middleclass even the staunchest civil righters cannot suggest that the poverty program is a serious answer to inequality yet by default this poverty war is their only real proposal the ability of a people to dream for that in reality is what a utopia is about is a sign of hope and an affirmation of life for a group to lack this power to dream or to be unable to construct a utopian model is an admission of a deep sense of powerlessness on the part of that group no utopias have been projected by the civil righters the fact that the entire negro freedom movement has failed to project a goal is another index of the powerlessness of the movement itself save for those small groups who have begun the long tortuous road to community organization and community development the negro freedom movement without model or goal is marching ever marching without knowing from whence it came or where it goes with such unchartered course however all movement can be considered progress all change seems to be beneficial all activity no matter how poorly conceived becomes desirable activity is essential because it obscures the vacuum which exists in the thinking and planning of the civil righters themselves the movement of the past six years therefore has been a generally unsuccessful attempt to substitute motion for thought it has been an attempt to make an unwilling society live up to its verbalizations of brotherhood of man freedom and democracy the revolutionaries have not questioned the values of the society merely some of its practices it is safe to conclude that from its beginning the negro reform movement without relevant point of view nor adequate institutions nor a goal has been doomed to real but not apparent failure revolutions begin in the minds of men a slave is one who will not do his own thinking the negro reform movement is a product of the hearts and feet of men the reform movement has not captured the minds of men primarily because it has not aimed at their minds instead the reform has been directed towards mens hearts the reform movement has assumed that it is possible to find freedom and equality under the current economic and social system integrate ones way out of a system of inequality involve the federal government meaningfully in the protection of the constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizenship the reformers have placed great faith in ageless promises of democracy human dignity and the value of personality furthermore the civil righters have felt that this society meant to provide a piece of the action to the blacks negroes have never understood that they themselves were the action the main target in a classic game of exploitation after five years some persons have slowly begun to recognize that legal citizenship guarantees do not apply to the rank and file negroes and that those citizenship guarantees that the middleclass negro groups have apparently secured are never assured there is a need therefore not for a mere change of tactics but for a reexamination of the struggle its direction its premises and assumptions such a reassessment must occur before the voterregistrationlaw euphoria has fully set in for while many hail the passage of the voterrights bill few have seriously questioned the primary assumption of that legislation viz that once the right to vote is secured the negro will stand on the threshold of winning his other rights the truth is that after six years of effort although the negros position has improved politically somewhat in every other sphere his life situation has become even more precarious than it was in employment exploitation has given way to automated uselessness his housing condition deteriorates steadily and housing segregation is steadily increasing the negro family trembles and rocks under successive economic shock waves migration from the farm overcrowds the already bursting ghettos and their facilities middleclass negroes and white liberals in their zest to reform have talked of significant progress changing the negros image and trying to meet the need of the present with programs out of the past designed to help persons in the distant future instead of paying attention to the work of the social and political scientists the negro has just ignored the facts and continued waging his moral crusade in placing trust in the moralist the middleclass negro with his allies has revealed that the negro does not wish to be a free man for six years the negro and his allies have been dreaming screaming shouting marching sittingin wadingin lyingin to be a part of a white racist society which has decreed that it will not treat him either as a free man or as an equal human being still the negro has pursued this goal with determination zeal and tenacity the past years have therefore been merely a prelude to a creative and forceful action to defeat racism a prelude of unrequited love unrewarded suffering and unbelievable naivete a prelude to meaningful preception conception and action which must procede any major social change if this period has been a prelude then impatient negroes must learn to accept the fact that some men learn very slowly indeed if on the other hand the civil_rights forces and their leaders continue along the same path then what is prelude for the negro people marks the finale for the current negro leaders i learned a new word the other day jj underclass evidently a it means poor folks ccznc thirty years ago most of us were called working class we didnt mind that and a few of us even liked it working class had a sturdy independent sound then it became a dirty word the people with jobs who made enough money graduated to the middleclass and now we leftovers are the underclass and nobody is supposed to like that we dont have enough money we are told because we lack motivation education skills influence and some of us are the wrong color our wellintentioned friends who discovered us want to help us get out of this underclass as fast as we can to give us a handup into their middleclass at the risk of seeming ungrateful to these good white liberals lets stop a bit to look around before we start to scramble out it may look different to us down here than it does to the white liberal in his neat mortgaged little house in the suburbs first who are we i am an underclass white woman who refuses to identify with or aspire to middleclass values and i presume to speak for that minority with underclass values as well as pocketbooks most of the black people in the ghetto are defined by their incomes as near or among the underclass and their separate subculture is recognized being white i know that i cannot speak for the black underclass but perhaps i am permitted to speak about my harlem neighbors perhaps white as i am i may look with them from out of the ghetto at what our betters expect us to scramble for and imitate for to me the black ghetto is the last great reservoir of dignity and courage and humanity and to it i have turned for refuge now let us look up into the suburb down here we can afford the time to live when we are through work we can laugh and play and be kind really completely and i dont think you in the suburbs can ever relax enough to do that once you start scrambling with everyone else there in the suburb for a bigger salary a bigger house and a bigger mortgage the scrambling must take every bit of you every minute of your lives we can stand up to the boss instead of cringing before him we can be decent and fair to our fellow humans instead of trying to climb on their backs or slit their throats we can have friends because they are friends and not just the right people to cultivate we can be and do what we want because we are not living to impress our neighbors all this of course is mixed up with a lot of frustration and misery and wed like to sort it out please sometimes you even say your suburb is a great kind of nonliving it seems so to a few of us we like your suburb but not the way you live in it about ten years ago i had two underclass sons in high school in a suburban and farming community the school undertook to roll them out and stamp out two middleclass boys just like the millions of gingerbread boys that are coming off our high school assembly lines every year it failed and at times the boys resistance to the rolling and stamping process became conscious rebellion the school administration was piqued because they didnt turn out for athletics it wasnt patriotic the boys were too busy raising cattle running our farm working parttime and participating in activities of their own choice to oblige the administration they wore jeans to school by preference and necessity they enjoyed some of the subjects but they came to despise the conformity and hypocrisy that undergirded the school they learned many things not in the curriculum for my younger son the first lesson came shortly after he entered school a larger older boy a prominent athlete began picking on him it seemed to be working up to a fight one day passing each other in the hall the athlete made an obscene gesture to my son he replied with bastard the athlete cursed him back and my son punched him they were exchanging blows when the viceprincipal came along stopped the fight and demanded an explanation my son told the truth expecting equal punishment the athlete denied making the dirty gesture and blamed my son for starting the fight the viceprincipal believed him my son concluded since the man couldnt be that stupid that the official favored the big boy because he was a prominent athlete my older son had a stimulating civics course in which the students examined various forms of government including communism during the mccarthy hysteria the teacher was run out of the school by local american legion pressure he took a position at a junior college the boys brother taking the course two years later found a timorous little man teaching platitudes and avoiding the study of controversial material the boy spent the semester needling the teacher was he afraid to think about anything that happened after the nineteenth century one night the boys came home excited and angry they had been with a group of students at a drivein that evening when the police came looking for a gang that wasnt there the police told the students to clear out two other underclass brothers were slow to move along a cop came up from behind and banged their heads together not realizing who it was one of the brothers whirled quickly and swung at the cop the cop began clubbing him and his brother jumped the cop both boys were arrested one was a student the other out of school with a police record the policeman had a reputation for brutality with teenagers i shared my sons indignation and agreed with their determination to stand by the arrested boys the school administration cooperated with the police in preparing a case against the boys it called in prominent students and rehearsed with them a story of sinister gangs in the school the throng that congregated casually on the steps there were no organized gangs my older son testified for the defendants we reached a concensus its rotten but stay in school and out of trouble one beautiful spring day a spontaneous mass vacation from school occurred that included not only the usual truants but prominent students from good families my younger son then in his last year joined the exodus the next day the students returned to school with their excuses evidently it had really been an unaccountable epidemic of illness my son reported to the office to get back into school wheres your excuse i havent any he replied the administrator admitted him for the day only the next morning the boy was again in the office wheres your excuse i havent any i tell you and i wont have any my mother wont lie for me the boy was severely punished with endless hours to make up after school the other students excuses were blandly accepted we learned of this incident from a teacher after both my sons were through school one afternoon a janitor was driving away from the school when missiles began thumping the top of his car looking up he saw two boys tossing empty beer cans from an upperfloor window he returned to investigate found the boys drunk in an empty classroom and notified the school authorities the boys were not punished the entire affair was hushed up and the janitor was warned not to make something out of it at peril to his job one of the boys was the son of a local banker and school board member among the teachers my sons had a few good friends who liked and understood them underclassness and all encouraged by his english and drama teachers my younger son decided to apply for admission to the state university which his older brother was by that time atnding he went to the office for the proper form the guidance officer refused him the form urging instead that he enroll at a junior college for vocational training in mechanicsobviously more appropriate for an underclass youngster in jeans the boy was not interested and was indignant i wrote an acid note to the counselor indicating my contempt for his values the boys english teacher persuaded him not to deliver the note but she encouraged him to insist on the admission blank he finally got it shortly after this the boy and the english teacher were discussing the recipient of the best local scholarship to the university hell never make it the boy predicted hes an applepolisher who knows how to make himself look good and thats why the faculty chose him but hes dumb the scholarship winner flunked out the first year so my sons managed to get through high school without the rolling and stamping two oddlooking figures among the gingerbread boys that came off the assembly line the most important lessons of those years were not accredited that in the middleclass world one need pay only lip service to truth honor and goodness that the search for knowledge is better confined safely to noncontroversial subjects that the price of middleclass success would be their nonconformity that integrity and selfrespect are expensive commodities to be jettisoned in the scramble that the smooth plausible surface is infinitely more important than the right or wrong underneath whatever of morality they learned was outside ofand in spite ofthe school these were white boys therefore they were taught had they been black boys in a ghetto school they would not have been taught and there would have been little pressure to conform to middleclass values black youngsters didnt need to know about being middle class for they didnt belong there anyway now our wellintentioned white friends who want to haul us up out of the underclass propose to break up the ghetto schools and teach the black boys give them as good an education as all those little gingerbread boys rolling out of our high schools every spring have received it is assumed the black boys will be grateful this is why their parents have been demonstrating and boycotting segregated schools most white educators recognize a subculture exists in the negro community their conception of it varies to some the underclass ghetto is filled with irresponsible primitives given to music dancing sex and cutting their neighbors a few concede the loyalty and lack of competitiveness of the ghetto are virtues but i doubt if any of them have gone grocery shopping on a saturday afternoon in a certain small supermarket in harlem it is negromanaged and almost entirely negrostaffed i preferred it to the larger lowerpriced white supermarkets in the area because the customers were treated like neighbors instead of colonials the aisles are narrow the store crowded the carts begin to look like a downtown traffic jam half a dozen customers are lined up waiting to have vegetables weighed but for all the confusion and delay he people are gracious and goodhumored the inevitable small collisions become matters for genuine concern and apology the woman at my check stand has a real smile and the box boy a high school student is full of friendly small talk i contrast this to the cool perfunctory politeness of the suburban supermarket where the checker and box boy manage to combine a dale carnegie obsequiousness with contempt and the customers barely mask their irritation at the slightest inconvenience i cannot know the pain and tensions that lie beneath the dignity and warmth of my harlem neighbors but i find the behavior of these underclass black people in the supermarket vastly pleasanter and more civilized than that of their white superiors in the suburbs nowwhat have these white educators who know nothing of my supermarket in harlem to give the underclass black boy depending on their competence they can give him knowledge and skills regardless of their competence they will probably try to give him their middleclass value system many negro boys will undoubtedly accept all this and darkercolored gingerbread boys will begin rolling out of the high schools indistinguishable from the lighter ones but the best of the underclass black boys may resist they will retreat into the proud hostility with which my boys fought the schools pattern of middleclass conformity they will be termed incorrigible unmotivated and ungrateful they would like the knowledge and skills but not at the price of their own integrity their parents will watch with loving concern as i did cherishing their sons strength fearful that the boys alienation mav drive them to consider them selvesand to be considered cutaws it is wildly funny even to think of expecting the educators to move bto the ghetto so that they could measure some of their statistics and stereotypes against reality their superiority and condescension ae so deep that it is inconceivable to them that they could learn from the underclass but mavbe we can reach a truce with them let them stop talking about the culturallydeprived child because the term may mean anything or nothing to them it means a black child in the ghetto to me it means a white child in the suburbs lets agree that underclass children need to be taught reading mathematics science fine arts and social studies devoid of middleclass propaganda they do recognize that we are the underclass separate from their middleclass let the schools confine themselves to knowledge and leave out the compulsory value system although the educators apparently worship money and success let them quit patronizing us because we are poor and undistinguished if their middleclass culture looks good to us well try to adopt it quickly enough if not thats our business possibly the high school assembly line could then convert from gingerbread boys to human beings at the recent writers conference at fisk university ossie davis had some striking things to say about the importance of images said mr davis images must correspond to some accepted reality upon which people communicate and are agreed probing further he asked do you know that because of the connotation the word black has in our culture when you look at your child and call him black you have already insulted him in sixty different ways certainly one of those ways is implied when one looks in an anthology even the most recent ones to find such a neglect of negro writers that it is appalling there seems to be one reason for this neglect the image of the negro as a serious writer is extremely difficult if not downright minacious certainly three centuries has produced writers whose works are worthy of recognition the neglect is calculated the negros image as a writer suffers of course a solitary few make the grade yet in no area is pure tokenism so evident another way in which the negro is insulted is that too often before he opens his mouth even in the presence ofperhaps especially in the presence ofthe white who knows him only across the discussion table he is labeled if his language is the cultured speech of his training it is passed off as imitative if it is characterized by the dialect of an uneducated environment though no less different in the main from the speech of immigrants it is regarded as repulsive quaintness is the reason for other linguistic aberrations in america explanation for poor speech among negroes is connected with physical type no one would attempt to explain the phraseology throw mama from the train a kiss in terms of size of mouth shape of nose or mental type yet many writers of the early twentieth century sought to do this with negroes according to dr raven mcdavid and his wife jerome dowd j a tillinghast and even early howard odum have deliberately publicized arguments for the allegedly childlike mentality of the nesro as reasons for dialectal variations or imagine the temerity of albert wiggam who claimed in his popular column lets explore your mind that the negro cannot pronounce words such as car beard and bird because his lips are too thick thick lips and blackness have long been a part of this combination of insults which every negro has felt regardless of the varying hues of his skin as recently as spring explaining a fundsponsored project in updating negro speech the newscaster referred to the average speech of the negro as repulsive and unintelligible this somewhat blanket statement is hardly fair in isolation for it could easily be said of any group or any situation where there are expected departures from common language patternsfamily relationships daily chores work play cookery and even intimacies language has three basic forms if one is to try to assess its variations scientifically lexical phonetic and morphological lexically the negro has participated fully in adding to and perpetuating the word stock of his country this participation and contribution goes far back into the history in america proof of this is to be found all the way from his earthy southern speech to the louisiana patois to the gullah of south carolina and georgia to the bahamian traces in key west and miamito the classic epithets i remember from a dear lady nearly years old who though nearly illiterate in the specific sense was verbose in the use of such alliterative phrases as sitting there like a nut on a tusset said in sibilant disgust phonetically and morphologically perhaps because of the negros isolation from american cultural life for so long the negros speech variations are most apparent and to some obnoxious close examination will show that dialect forms are in many instances similar to th century english english teachers of the race no doubt overzealously have demanded strict adherence to the rule often forgetting the students and even their own erstwhile background certain pronunciations do seem troublesome picture vs pitcher diploma postponed mischievous to mention only a few yet listening in on rural radio or television stations one realizes that mispronunciations are not racially inspired nonconformity to morphological forms is apparent in numerous verbs principal parts of drink become begin do etc conjugation of the verb to be in the present and past tenses for example yet one immediately recalls that lil abner is not based on negro cultural life education is gradually wiping out grammatical variations and it seems to me that the time has come for the triplelinguistic revolution of appreciating the contributions lexically and literally that negroes have made to american culture allowing the negro a chance to see himself in perspective as he moves into a new era and allowing the negro at this historical juncture to begin to look back with natural pride not shame upon the folkways and folk language of his own group the great societys t war on poverty has one feature that cannot be overemphasized among the youth of the underprivileged and that is the various programs intended to introduce culturally deprived youth to books and libraries the project head start for preschoolers with its story hours and availability of many wellwritten and excellently illustrated childrens books and the wellstocked libraries for the young people in the job corps are not luxuries by any means but rather they are important ingredients for successful programs the mixture of the right books and poverty historically have stimulated some very interesting creative results among men excellent examples would be the cases of james baldwin ralph ellison and richard wright all three having several facts about their lives in common first they are americans from similar economic and cultural backgrounds second they are negroes and third somewhere in their writings they have revealed that books andor librarians have played important roles in their lives as creative writers it was as a youngster that baldwin discovered the librarya harlem branch of the new york public library he attended the childrens story hours in the afternoons and on saturday mornings where he listened to the stories told by the childrens librarian as a teenager he was a ferocious reader he read and reread uncle toms cabin and the tale of two cities and held as his favorite authors henry james ernest hemingway john steinbeck nathaniel hawthorne and many others he discovered in his community and school libraries by the time baldwin was he was a preacher at the storefront fireside pentecostal church in harlem the school librarian and some of his teachers remember him as a small bright sadlooking boy he was editor of the high school literary magazine and spent much of his free time reading and writing instead of playing stick ball on the streets of harlem after three hysteriatinged years as a preacher he discovered that he would rather be a writer than a boy preacher his big break came in when he was awarded a eugene saxton fellowship which permitted him to devote full time to his literary work following his first professional publication which was a book review in the nation magazine it was not long before articles and stories appeared in partisan review american mercury commentary reporter and harpers magazines like many of the earlier american writers who as young artists found themselves disenchanted with home and became exiled baldwin moved to paris in it was while in paris that he was able to develop in a more congenial atmosphere he stated that he wanted to go to paris so that he would not become merely a negro writer but after a few years he found that paris was not completely the haven he had expected at least he was able to publish his first book a novel with a significant enough title go tell it on the mountain following this first published work came several other works of fiction and essays there is no doubt that james baldwin is a significant contributor to american letters librarians like to think about baldwins introduction to the harlem branch of the new york public library as the beginning of his becoming a writer an author dedicates his book to an individual or individuals who have been an inspiration to him or contributed in some great way to the writing of his book in ralph ellisons latest book shadow and act published in his dedication reads for morteza sprague a dedicated dreamer in a land most strange it is significant to note that the dreamer the late morteza sprague was librarian at tuskegee institute for years or more sprague still remembers vividly the first time he encountered ralph ellison as a freshman taking an introductory literature course as a youngster ellison discovered t s eliots wasteland and because of his interest in poetry he attempted to follow up all the footnotes reading all those books perhaps it was in the library at tuskegee that he discovered the negro poet countee cullen and his powerful poem heritage a poem that was to make a profound change in ellisons attitude towards the negro who knows maybe it was cullens poem that helped him to answer the question what am i some years later with the following remark i answer that i am a negro american that means far more than something racial it does not mean race it means something cultural that i am a man who shares a dual heritage books librarians and poverty i am sure proved to be interesting chemistry in the life of the creative genius ralph ellison in the case of richard wright peasant life on a mississippi plantation was never forgotten as a youngster wright lived in natchez jackson greenwood and carters in mississippi elaine helena and west helena in arkansas and memphis tenn as we can see his childhood consisted of moving from one southern town to the next or parttime jobs and sporadic schooling at he ran away from home and took a job in memphis it was there that he had his first public library experience in his essay the ethics of jim crow published in he describes how he devised a way to borrow books from the public library it was almost impossible to get a book to read it was assumed that after a negro had imbibed what scanty schooling the state furnished he had no further need for books i was always borrowing books from white men on the job one day i mustered enough courage to ask one of the men to let me get books from the library in his name surprisingly he consented armed with a library card i obtained books in the following manner i would write a note addressed to the librarian and sign the name of the white supervisor i would stand at the desk hat in hand looking as unbookish as possible when i received the books i would take them home if the books listed in the note happened to be out i would sneak into the lobby and forge a new one in this manner wright developed even deeper his passion for reading cutting his teeth on such authors as theodore dreiser h l mencken sinclair lewis and sherwood anderson his first published pieces were poems articles and stories the federal writers project hired him and published one of his stories in the anthology american stuff his first book uncle toms children was followed by native son twelve million black voices black boy the outsider and several other works of lesser stature james baldwin ralph ellison and the late richard wright did not have the head start classes of today where hundreds of children are being introduced to not only books but painting music and all of the other wonderful things children need in todays world to make their lives more meaningful and complete we know that it was only through chance that these men discovered books but let us not leave to chance for future baldwins ellisons and wrights because we know now that books and poverty do mix in all the tumult and shouting over established racial discrimination in the various areas of community life in chicago the national spotlight has declined to linger on one of the most positive and concrete accomplishments to emerge from the freedom movements struggle it is just as well operation breadbasket proceeds most effectively in the quiet semianonymity of the phone call and the conference and it has been effective in early september after less than six months of pressure and negotiation operation breadbasket had secured for chicago negroes some jobs representing a staggering total in annual income of approximately operation breadbasket in chicago is organized along the same lines as its successful predecessors in other cities notably philadelphia ministers of both races and of many religious faiths and denominations band together to seek jobs for negroes in those industries which do considerable business in the negro community but which nevertheless hire few if any negroes a committee of these ministers approach the management of these businesses suggest that they add a previously determined number of negro employees and offer their services in steering qualified personnel toward the industry in the beginning many of the businesses balked when that happened the ministers returned to their pulpits advised their parishioners to boycott the products of the reluctant businesses and waited it was never necessary to wait long when the money stopped pouring into the coffers the business management saw the light negroes were hired operation breadbasket shrewdly concentrated first on dairies for the produce butter milk of dairies is perishable boycotts quickly show results there soft drink manufacturers are particularly vulnerable in the summer and campaigns were mounted to bring them into the hiring line dozens of truckdriving jobs paying to a year were made available to chicago negroes for the first time that the industries capitulated with such ease is in itself an indication of the widespread and longstanding inequity which characterizes the hiring policies of the firms even in those cases where the businesses employed some negroes a pattern of excluding negroes from toplevel jobs was clear operation breadbasket also demanded that negroes be upgraded in some of the boycotted firms chicagos operation breadbasket is an arm of the coordinating council of community organizationssouthern christian leadership council campaign against slums and their evils all the ministers of the community are invited to participate and most of those with some social consciousness and some sense of involvement in the freedom movement have done so a few notably influential ministers have refrained from lending their support to the program operation breadbasket is fortunate in chicago to have the services of a young minister and divinity student named jesse jackson not yet the rev mr jackson is blessed with the kind of balance and maturity which usually comes with age he is cool under fire determined and articulate but he also knows human psychology and something of the limitations of his movements power not the least important his wit and humor does not allow him to take himself too seriously not too many years ago after world war ii a azz pianist named thelonius monkal rnii ready a mature black artistwas struggling to be heard he had a new kind of music that some people couldnt quite understa it and others laughed at and called bebop we all know what has happened since this time and few people today are not familiar with monk and his music monk is now an accepted legitimate black artist what we dont know though is the hell that this man had to go through to be heard and appreciated and the fact that every black artist has these same terrifying barriers to go throughbarriers that take up a lot of unnecessary time for the black artist that has not made it the problem is how to reach a public that is controlled by people who to say the least are not with him i contend that every jazz lover if he could only see what black choreographers are doing in the field of modern dance would also be a dance fan but in this field the black artist finds himself in a strange position he knows the worth of his works he knows that the black public would appreciate and understand what he is saying as an artist yet he finds great difficulty in reaching not only the black public but any public at all lets face it the powersthatbe are not interested in seeing negroes in any way but as rhythmic freaks about whom they say they certainly do have a good sense of rhythm well i am not an animal and i wont tap dance or play the part of the maid i am a human being and have the same feelings that any other human being would have i dont want to entertain them if i am thrown in a ghetto and condemned to an outcast life of hating i am not going to create a ballet about swans it would be completely divorced from reality and a little bit insane if i did i can only create from the life around me i am sure that you realize as a black man or negro in american today it isnt pretty so when and if you do come to see my dances please dont expect to see pretty things the man that is the destroyer because he has had the seed of hate planted in him is what im talking aboutthe junkie my vision of harlem is that it is a modern equivalent of the slave auction bloc and the black mans work and worth is still being sold in a very subtle but direct way the auction block is the central motif of my work blues for the jungle premiered at an october concert at kaufmann auditorium in new york city the dancers who historically mount the block trace the development of the black man in america we see the railroad worker who built the west the jubilant new freedman the sanctified gospel people the blues singing entertainer the tap dancer and the junkie all of these people are the modern equivalent of slaves here in rich america today and because of this they end the work in a riot scene that shows they simply want to destroy what has destroyed them as human beings baby this is not swan lake this is america circa and any black artist worth the sweat on his back from creating has to deal with this reality which is exactly what is here now if you can see what i am creating now i certainly would appreciate it id hate to have to wait until the power structurepromoters and impresarios and you know who they arethink that you are ready in another or years in any case it is you that im talking to and its you that im talking about the blues i sing is our blues baby in early autumn last year a young britain of dutch birth and ancestry arrived in the united states for a particularly happy tour he had come to meet the galaxy of poets and novelists whose work he had knownand even publishedfor a number of years but who he had never met in person paul breman reached new york just in time to attend the ceremonies during which president leopold senghor of senegal presented awards to those americans who won in absentia grand prizes at last springs first world festival of negro arts in senegals capital city mr bremans new york host was poet langston hughes who he had met in detroit mr breman was guided by poet dudley randall in indianapolis by mari evans and in chicago by conrad kent rivers in new york mr breman met poet robert hayden winner of the festivals grand prize for poetry and an acquaintance and collaborator by correspondence up to that meeting in mr bremans capacity as publisher of the heritage series of volumes of poetry by north american negroes he had published a collection of mr haydens poems under the title also the title of the principal poem a ballad of remembrance the other three volumes in the series are sixes and sevens an anthology with many of the newer poets represented haverstraw a collection of poems by frank horne and personals a collection of poems by arna bontemps mr breman reported that a number of the elegant little volumes which he published at his own expense in london are still available and that they may be obtained by writing to him directly at wedder burn road london nw england as a consequence of his visit to the united states other volumes may now be in the works since mr bremans publishing venture to date has been primarily a labor of love it was presumed that some of his energies were directed toward some enterprise of a more certain remunerative nature that enterprise turned out to be the book business but a very special branch of it mr breman is an antiquarian bookseller or a procurer and vendor of rare old volumes in fact much of mr bremans sojourn on these shores was financed by the sale of a single rare old volume on stage chicagos hull house theatre which has established a south side branch offers classes in acting under the supervision of annette hankin formerly of actors studio the free southern theatre with a rockefeller foundation grant and a boost from the columbia broadcasting systems television series look up and live may be enroute to taking firm root in southern soil in july with tom dent at the helm the troupe was at home in a building in the desire section of new orleans during the summer the new heritage repertory theatre in harlem presented a series of performances in various locations in the ghetto the theatre is headed by roger furman and walter julio and is based at the hans christian andersen community center twice weekly the theatre went mobile on its tour of harlem frederick oneal president of actors equity received a certificate of appreciation on behalf of new york actors from the city of new york the certificate specifically praised the actors for outstanding contribution and exceptional services to the new york city antipoverty program because they performed without salaries for operation head start programs all over the city during the summer speaking of ruby dees performance during the ypsilanti mich greek theater festival last summer robert kotlowitz wrote in harpers magazine one revelation of the production is ruby dee who acts on the very edge of convulsion as cassandra when she is frustrated she simply lies down on the floor of the stage and thrashes around in agony no halfway measures here miss dee is clearly ripe for any part she would set her mind to both shaws and shakespeares cleopatra for example could use her talent which is made up of equal parts vigor suppleness conviction unusual stamina and a winning beautiful smile nat hentoff has a healthy list of literary credits and they grow more impressive each year his call the keeper viking is a brief but poignant display of his allround writing ability call the keeper is a fast reading novel perhaps even a novella which makes a swift excursion into black nationalism black nationalism is probably as old as black men but there are new inferences and ingredients as the black man continues his current search for himself in white america there are sequences in this book and messages which required some courage for hentoff to commit to paper this compensates for some of the false ring of the dialogue one of the most powerful characters sounds more like an english lord than an intellectual cop if you can imagine one hentoff makes some fairly sound statements about the basic philosophies and rationale of black nationalism as it now stands further he seems to have something of an idea of what its all about which is more than most negroes for example can honestly claim despite the fact that the book is about black nationalism one of the most attractive characters is randal a white musician i am not certain that hentoff intended this to be so but when randal is compared against other characters he seems to be the hippest of the lot randal simply is he plays randal white jazz musician he has the respect of the black chauvinist who leads the group randal plays in because he doesnt try to be black he plays out of what he knows this is perhaps the best message of the book a man simply has to play what he knows otherwise you sound like the sons of mothers who had colored maidsbrooks johnson ri the world of jakov lind is a place of unending horror there is no corner in it where the reader may settle down amongst familiar and normal signs and souls and be for a while at peace his collection of short stories soul of wood was such a place peopled by creatures out of a nightmare so real that it was impossible to dispel them and his new novel landscape in concrete grove is also such a place the central character of this picaresquefantasy is a german soldier named bachmann the time is the last months of world war ii when the wehrmacht is suffering defeats on the eastern front and there is an atmosphere of disarray and desperation bachmann is lost from his unit somewhere on the eastern frontwhile in retreat his unit was mired in mud and the novel begins with bachmann alone in a forest far from the front but he is not alone for long he comes upon a strange weasellike creature a soldier like himself who lives in a burrow in the ground the soldiers team up sharing a forest hut and a goose dinner but they are natural enemies the antipathy of each other the one burly and not very bright the other razorthin and as cunning as a cat the one stolid and disciplined the other sensitive and devious and bachmann the heavy plodding embodiment of all the germanic virtues outwitted and deceived ends by executing his antagonist but it is not his only murder in norway where bachmanns erratic search for his comrades leads him he calmly shoots down three members of a wealthy family on orders from a sinister civilian bent on exploiting his uncanny power over the german bachmann finds his way back to germany to the town where the girl he would marry is waiting passing her time evading the amorous attentions of her benefactress and bestowing her favors on imported laborers from nonnordic lands this girla mountain of a femalehas been ever in his dreams but when she is finally in his arms he sleeps but bachmann is mad he has been adjudged so and his flight across germany has been undertaken in an effort to regain his status as a sane man and as a true son of the fatherland for he is a patriot and it is impossible to imagine not serving his country in the end however having acceptedno insisted uponhis madness he is told that he is indeed quite sane and that he is absentwithoutleave from his unit he is sane then the world is mad these are the bare outlines of landscape in concrete conveying nothing of the special quality of terror and cynicism and symbolism with which the novel abounds for despite the figures of ridicule and satire evil overblown what emerges is merely a picture of a universe beyond the pale and that is imaginable that is believable indeed in reading landscape in concrete one can begin to comprehend the horror which flowered in germany and threatened to overshadow the world and one can begin to see how approval of murder in mississippi can set the stage for american buchenwalds the budding flower landscape in concrete is a grotesquely compelling novel it also is a warning thomas e eliots classic statement on the metaphysical poets in an essay by that title in is too well known to warrant explication here yet besides contributing to or more accurately spearheading the impetus for the revival of the metaphysicals as objects of study the essay stands as a classic example of the power and influence wielded conjointly by the critic and ralph ellison the university eliots essay gave rise to a new group of critics who less judicious than either dr samuel johnson or matthew arnold have dictated the tastes and forms of english literature mainly in america for over a decade and those new critics in most instances were connected with the university either in teaching positions or through prestige and influence the trend in recent years toward a different type of orientation in most cases going back to the biographicalhistorical method of taine and saint beuve only serves to point up the importance of both the critic and the university in determining not only literary standards but to a great degree the works which in the judgment of the combine criticsenglish professors meet these standards the result has been of course a dictatorship which makes the dictators of oldpope dryden dr johnsonseem like new deal democrats those who have been damaged most severely under the iron rule of this combine are negro writers never taken seriously in the american society never conceived of as much more than a protester the negro writer today despite james baldwin and ralph ellison fares little better among the men of the ivory tower than his predecessor saunders redding has adequately summed up the argument against the anthology writers who refuse to anthologize selections of negro authors yet the nucleus of the problem lies in the classroom itself and here the negro members of the combine are as guilty as the white members recently a young graduate of a distinguished negro college in the south who had majored in english literature and had taken several courses in american literature asked me after thumbing through one of the books on my shelf who is this man i never heard of him before this man was james weldon johnson and the book was his autobiography of an excolored man to document the ignorance of the white collegian would be needless for few white students to whom i have talked have knowledge of any negro writer outside of the big three wright baldwin and ellison however the example of a professor may serve as a case in point the professor holding a doctorate in english literature and at one time chairman of the department of a university renown for its english department on reading a paper of mine with saunders redding as the subject implored me to find out if the works of saunders redding could be found in the university library i think he remarked that every student should read the works of this man thank you for bringing him to my attention this was in and saunders reddings first book appeared in but more than ignorance of the works of negro writers is involved here much more pernicious are the concerted efforts by critics and professors to dispute the charges brought against the american society by the negro writer without having to engage in a dialectic the concept of the liberal professor willing to acquiesce in change and to examine the new and different is a concept nonapplicable to the professors of english departments for the most part english professors are the most zealous conservative upholders of the status quo more inclined to quote dr johnson to champion that which is right because it is established than that which is established because it is right a case in point is professor robert bones book the negro novel in america which for some years now has served as a source book for any study dealing with negro literature professor bone pretends to examine his subject with the scrutiny of the objective literary historian yet throughout the book bone drops his mask to record his personal reaction to any statement or any work as a whole that dares to point accurately to the reality of the american society let us hope it will not be taken as evidence of american chauvinism if we point out that there are in fact important differences between the negros status in philadelphia and in georgia between the systematic genocide of the hitler government and the supreme court decision of he writes in explicating william gardner smiths last of the conquerors if we concede that professor bone is not being chauvinistic we must then assume thatfor want of a better wordhe is being naive if we substitute new york for philadelphia not the philadelphia of when smiths book was published but today when according to bone great progress has been made and accept the basic contention of bones argument that the negro is better off in new york than in georgia then we would be hard put to explain why the most vocal voices of protest against the american society are the voices of two new yorkers james baldwin and leroi jones but the second half of the statement is not only naive but ludicrous in that bone attempts a feat of logical legerdemain which would not deceive even a first year philosophy major the analogy between the systematic genocide of the hitler government and the supreme court decision of is no analogy at all better would be the analogy between the genocide of the hitler government and the lynching of over negroes a recorded number which does not include justifiable homicide a favorite phrase of northern police courts or deaths from unknown causes such as bodies found in the mississippi river during the search for the bodies of chaney goodman and schwerner but this is an analogy which professor bone cannot bring himself to make and those negro writers who make such analogies receive the most devastating attacks in bones anthology nothing better illustrates this fact than the almost hysterical critique of the works of james baldwin in less than pages bone asserts that baldwin is everything from a sexual maniac to a psychopath indeed sex becomes the organizing principle around which bone bases his criticism of baldwin but clear to the reader is the fact that bone has undertaken a defense of the sexual and racial mores of the american society james baldwin in particular and the negro protest writer in general is then his dragon and he bone is the societys st george for an example of how baldwin can be criticized sanely and from an unbiased point of view see saunders reddings since richard wright and the problem of the negro writer but bone at least has the courage of his convictions unlike other instructors and critics bone brings his contentions out into the open and he discusses ofttimes skillfully the deficiencies of many negro novels yet the majority of the instructors of english literature those in positions of responsibility make no such effort in many universities both negro and white one may receive a doctorate without having read one line by a negro author in a western university whose english department ranks among the best in the country the only negro author included in the syllabus is ralph ellison in fact the selection of ellison evidences the fact that tokenismnot confined only to the industrial and social sphere of the american society some time ago when an english department wished to display its propensity for taking all literature as its province richard wrights native son was ushered forth to prove that the university had its one negro representative for some reason the wright stock has nosedived but a successor in the form of james baldwin was quickly ushered in to retain the universitys image but alas the baldwin stock proved to be even less solvent than the wright stock baldwin lasted only about three years and to fill the gap ralph ellison was quickly brought forth the reasons for ellisons ascension to university eminence range from the oftquoted but true statement that invisible man is a supreme accomplishment in its own right to the assertion an assertion which both irving howe and ralph ellison have given credence to that invisible man is not a protest novel invisible man remarked a college professor deals with modern man in the universe not an isolated negro in an oppressive society nearer the truth is the fact that ellisons novel no less that the novels of james baldwin is a protest novel the only difference and an essential one is that ellison has clothed his novel in myth and symbolism so skillfully that the average critic is unable or unwilling to search for the protest beyond the symbols and myth another user of symbols and myths william blake has not been as fortunate in this respect as ellison scholars have looked for the meaning behind the blakean symbols and have discovered that poor old blake was an avid protestor after all this has not however caused his literary demise but instead has added to his prestige the ability to deal with ellison then by skirting the indictment of the american society means that ellison will be read in universities for a long time to come yet the majority of negro writers and i mean the good ones though being good has been no criterion for the selection of white authors for college syllabi will remain unread in colleges both negro and white for the american society is not yet capable of looking at the negro through glasses cleansed of years of prejudice and the combine which controls the selection of the material which could do most to erase this distorted impression exercises its vast power in a negative manner lee came into v the cafe to drink some if beer he had worked hard today it had rained too much to do any plowingcouldnt put a tractor out in that delta land when it was wet the rich loose top soil was so deep that a tractor would sink down in it so his boss man had made him dig ditches all day ditches that led nowhere the man had only required the work of him in order to keep him busy and ossie lee had had to dig the ditches there wasnt much else he could do he lived on the mans place in his house owed him money but ossie lee set aside his thoughts he wouldnt worry about all that now just sit here and rest a while spend the dollar he had in his pocket for some beer and wait on his friends from the other plantations to come around miss lula bring me a quart of falstaff and some skins miss lula came over to the table she was a big woman not yet old maybe she called everybody baby how you doing baby look like you been working hard got that mud all over your clothes in your hair a good looking man like you ought to take better care of himself you still younghow old are you bout im miss lula miss lula raised her voice so that the rest of the people in the cafe could enjoy the exchange well you sure dont look a day over maybe cause you still got a good body strong not all broke down like a lot of the men around here and i always did like the way you held yourself you know like couldnt nobody walk over you miss lula was smiling she was pleased to be able to speak so well of him maybe hed feel a little better now ossie lee appreciated her effort and replied in kind well miss lula i always liked the way you carried yourself too it took some doing to keep the cafe open without even a man to help you you a pretty good old lady even if you are getting fat from your own cooking she feinted a slap at his head for this little insult and then resumed her businesslike air i got to see what jimmie lee and them want over at the bar ill bring you your falstaff soons i take care of them i got some good neckbones cooked in the back you want to try some no miss lula i ate at mamas already just bring me the beer ossie lee put his foot up on the next chair and looked around to see who was there it had taken him a while to get used to the darkness the only light came from the schlitz beer signs with the luxuriously dressed brown girls and from the music box which commanded one end of the small cafe nobody was there that he knew well hed just wait nothing else to do no reason to go home there were two girls sitting over in the corner of the cafe he had not seen them before looked like they might be sisters the smaller girl was very pretty she was black and so thin that you felt you could see everything that was happening within her the movement of every muscle the angle of every bone he liked the way she looked he figured that they were from up on mr mills place he had heard that mills had brought in a new family up there miss lula returned to his table here baby heres your falstaff she noticed ossie lees feet in her chair her lips tightened now why you want to mess up my chairs putting your feet on them come on and do right always wanting me to keep this place but youall wont help me to keep it up you years old had a house of your own you know how to treat other peoples things ossie lee was offended but he took his feet down he couldnt afford to get her mad with him miss lula had a shotgun back there that she would put to anybody seeing that she had put ossie lee in his place she resumed her friendly manner she said i guess you pretty lonesome now since your wife left you i never did know what happened what did happen nothing much she was mess ing around james edwardyou know him he live down on mr hendersons placeand i wasnt going to have that everytime i told her about it she tried to get smart with me so id just have to whip her she musta got tired of that one day she went down the road to the store and just kept walking didnt even take her clothes yeah well where is she now she sent three bus tickets for the children the tickets were to memphis i guess thats where she is now miss lula stood quietly at the table for a moment then she directed his attention across the room you see those two girls over there in the corner they just come over to this county come from up in tallahatchie county a week ago some nice girls too named minnie pearl and johnnie mae the thin little black one with the yellow dress on minnie pearl she loves to dance why dont you put a quarter in the music box shell dance for you ossie lee looked at the cents he had left from his dollar he weighed the value of spending it now on the little black girl against the possibility that later he might get somebody to match it and buy another quart of beer he didnt know anything about the girl but she did look nice she was a pretty girl he hadnt been getting much satisfaction from drinking beer or from doing anything else lately seemed like no matter what he did he couldnt get satisfied the disappointments of his life weighed heavily on him in fact ossie lee had for the sake of his sanity accepted his life situation he had yielded to it long ago at the age of eight the acceptance of his life style had been irrevocably forced upon him the night they came to take him that night they called ossie lees father to the door they were two jesse come here want to talk to you bout that smartacting boy of yours his father turned to his mother get them in the back sarah mae she hurried the children ranging in age from years to three months into the back of the tworoom house his father went to the front door forced a smile to his face how yall this evening we fine jesse only thing wrong with us is that boy of yours ossie lee he let one of my chickens get run over this morning send him out here got to teach him a lesson he got to learn to take care of property else he aint never going to be a good hand ossie lee saw his fathers shoulders drop well sir mr perry i knew he been running too much aint got good sense yet but he still young i give him a good whipping tonight he do better no jesse i think i ought to take care of this myself he going to be working for me years he got to learn how to take care of my things realizing that he was in trouble ossie lee slipped over to where his mother had gathered the smallest children perry ignoring ossie lees father walked straight through the house and into the back he had a long cotton sack on his arm sarah mae give me the boy ossie lees arms went around his mothers waist she folded him into her skirt pressed him to her she pleaded with the boss man please sir dont take him off he just a baby just made eight years we take care he dont do nothing like that no more spare him this one time he just a baby perry did not bother to respond ossie lee looked up at his mother and over to his father for help neither his father nor his mother could look back into his face he began to cry no mama dont let him take me mama daddy mama in support of him the other children set to crying perry seemed not to hear or to see any of them he leaned over to ossie lee pulled him from his mother and despite the boys kicking and struggling forced him into the cotton sack as perry moved toward the door no one offered resistance ossie lee cried hard he knew that they must have heard him were they going to let this man take him away why didnt they run after him and pull the sack from his hands mama daddy you always took care of me where are you perry carried the boy out in the sack and handed him to the other man who had been waiting in the truck he cranked up the truck and drove away no one came even to the porch to see in what direction their boy had been taken as the truck moved away ossie lee came to understand that his people could neither refuse to let him be taken nor even demand the knowledge of where he would be taken understanding this he himself ceased to struggle against so obviously powerful a force his kicking subsided his crying ceased his muscles relaxed he merely waited to see what they would do to him after riding about minutes the truck stopped ossie lee was pulled from the truck and emptied from the sack onto the ground they had come to the muddy river where ossie lee had fished only a few days earlier the white men stood over him perry said boy you been mighty careless lately letting that chicken get run over dont seem like you want to be a good hand do it ossie lees immediate reaction was to defend himself to assert that he had been watching the chickens as best he could but that there had just been too many of them that he couldnt have kept up with all those chickens but then he checked himself he admitted that nothing he said would matter to these powerful men that it was their show and not his accordingly he replied thats right sir look like i aint able to be no good hand perry went on you got to learn to take care of property thats whats wrong with you colored people now you dont know how to take care of nothing im going to give you this whipping so youll watch after them chickens from now on get your britches down for the last time ossie lees self revolted no not my clothes you cant make me take off my clothes daddy dont even do that no perry stood over him you not going to do what i tell you well ill take them off for you and ignoring the last willful act that ossie lee was to perform in his lifetime the white man tore off his britches and began to whip him with a corded rope perry whipped him until he got tired and then the other man whipped him they kept it up for about minutes it hurt badly and ossie lee cried but he didnt really care anymore when they finished they shouted some words at him and left him lying by the river at which he used to play ossie lee waited until they left and gathered strength to clothe himself and return home in another half hour he made it home his parents were waiting for him in the same positions they had held when earlier they had allowed him to be carried off his father stood by the door alone his mother sat in the back room only the smallest children looked into his face as he opened the door and entered the dimly lit house at his arrival the family went back to its normal activities his mother gave the baby to carrie the sevenyearold and set about cooking some bread for supper the older children went out to get water and wood for the next morning the little children began to harass one another ossie lee said nothing he went over to his space on the bed which he shared with three brothers and lay down and buried his face in the quilt his only effort was not to think not to assess the situation which an hour ago had been thrust upon him soon after he had laid down his mother called him to supper she handed him two tin plates with biscuits and molasses here take your daddy his supper too ossie lee walked to the front and gave his father his supper he sat down on the floor next to his father and began to eat his father leaned over took the boys head in his hand and gently shook him you alright boy yessir im alright thats just the way things is you know yessir i know the remainder of ossie lees life followed the order established that night he did carefully what he was told never more never less along with the other children he tended the animals and chopped and picked the cotton and when each year after the cotton had been laid by it came to be revival time he too went to the mourners bench and got religion when he was big enough he was told to start driving a tractor this he did and continued to do for the rest of his life he learned to drink whiskey and to go with women at some point he married and brought forth three children to share the life which had devastated him through it all there was something in him which refused the final admission that he was dirt under white folks feet and that he deserved the dehumanization that they meted out to him yet he could not reject it he felt too old to leave home and start over again and since his father had died and his older brothers had left for chicago he had to stay on the place and do the mans work so that his mother and the children would have a house to live in and something to eat thus being able neither to accept nor to reject his life ossie lee had constantly to buffer himself against it but lately things had been going badly more closely each week dissatisfaction had approached his consciousness and he no longer had the means to push it back he still found comfort in the church and release in fighting and drinking with his friends but not like before now it was hard work to get happy ossie lee had grown weary in the defense of himself after he had finished his beer miss lula came back over to his table she encouraged him further about the girl sitting across the room go on and put your little quarter in the music box aint going to do you no good sitting there ossie lee looked across at the girl once more he did like the way she looked under miss lulas prodding ossie lee walked across the small room to the glowing big bellied music box and deposited his quarter he turned his head toward the girls yall want to come choose some records come get the music you want and dance for me the girls conferred with one another for a minute and then came over to where he stood they looked to be about years old ossie lee studied the little black one she looked clean had a pretty face as he watched her she looked from the music box to him assessing her new arena of activity her sister asked him his name where he lived and all that she said nothing only kept time to the music until her sister would be ready to dance when the music burst from the music box the two girls joined hands and danced together they danced lithely gracefully to ossie lee the little black girl so thin in her loosely fitting yellow dress looked especially graceful his senses followed her and were refreshed he followed her so closely that for the while that she danced for him he was able to push away the disturbing consciousness of his life as she danced he relaxed and leaned back on the music box to watch her when the music ended the girls went back to their seats laughing and talking breathless from their dancing later someone fed more coins to the music box this time it sent forth blues music slow pounding insightful music about loving and living ossie walked quickly over to the girl in order to reach her before anyone else when he brought her to him to dance it was as he had expected her body fitted itself to him fitted itself and then relaxed into him as they moved slowly with the music he pulled her still closer drinking in the ease with which she lived and moved they danced for an inmeasurable time when finally they sat to rest neither spoke he remained beside her for several minutes and finding no words stood up and walked over to where some friends were lounging against the far wall they received him without comment he too leaned against the wall propping himself with his booted foot he inquired of them that little girl got a man round here one of the men answered no dont think so she aint been here but a few weeks and aint none of us hit on her yet we just been watching her miss lula watches her pretty close miss lula really likes that girl aint let us get next to her say we dont mean her no good she likes for us all to dance and have fun but she dont want you to take that girl nowhere ossie lee grunted something in acknowledgement and walked away from them he kept walking through the door and on to his mothers house his life thereafter was centered around evenings at the cafe his days assumed a strange proportion the mornings went quickly he easily did his plowing ran his boss mans errands and carried the other hands home from the field to eat dinner he was eager to make the day go by so that evening would come but then after dinner when the evening was indeed near time seemed to stand still every task took forever the cotton rows seemed to be miles longer than they had been in the morning it seemed that evening would never come when finally the work day ended ossie lee would go home and so that he could savor every aspect of being with her he would force himself to change his clothes in a leisurely manner and to walk slowly up the road to the cafe when one evening he directed her from the dance floor to the door of the cafe she followed him outside he motioned to her to get into his ford as he cranked up the car he turned to her were going to get your things i want to marry you you can stay with me and mama this week and next saturday well marry ill get you a house soon as i can the girl turned to face him what about your wife shes gone she knew what she was doing when she left do you want to marry or dont you she said yes she would marry ossie lee drove to her mothers threeroom house some of the children were sitting on the sagging porch trying to fight off the mosquitoes and to get some cool air she went in spoke a few words to her mother and her sisters and gathered her things to go with him her mother came to the porch to see them off as the girl climbed back into the car her mother called to her you know you can always come back home at ossie lees home the girl was well received his mother was glad to have another woman around to help in the field and to see after the children the children liked her at once she played with them yet took them seriously and she danced with them even with the baby who couldnt walk in the evenings ossie lee took her to the cafe when he told miss lula that they were to marry she shook her head she sat down at the table with them and took the girls hand in hers she said baby i dont know how to say this but i dont think you should marry its too much in you for you to go off with some man now i wish you wouldnt do it im a old lady i seen a lot a pretty black girls but you got something special dont throw it away i know you got to live and you got to help your mama well it aint enough work here for two but ill give you a job here in my cafe if youll just stay on with your mama the girl understood she answered simply i think the best thing is for me to go with ossie lee the older woman turned to him you a good man alright ossie but you dont mean this girl no good you ought to let her stay home let her stay out where she can dance ossie lee chose to take her words lightly he laughed you better get away from here talking like that me and minnie pearl going to marry on sunday and everybody is invited to the wedding down at pilgrims rest miss lula turned back to the girl remember baby if anything happen you got a friend here the girl smiled thanks miss lula ill remember andill be alright they married on sunday later in the week ossie lee saw his boss man about getting a house for them to live in the man told him where he could have one but he said it might have to be cleaned up some then ossie lee and his wife went to look at the house it was an old wooden tworoom house with a tin roof because of its age the whole building leaned to one side it was filled to the ceiling with hay ossie lee was slapped again by the circumstances of his life he sat down on the broken steps and leaned his back against the wooden roof support that bastard expects folks to live in a place that he wont use for nothing better than hay i dont know sometimes i just dont know his girl stood on the porch between him and the door of the house she said to him thats alright well fix it up come on lets go up to the cafe for a while no i dont want to go to the cafe i dont want to go nowhere he walked away from the shack his head down and his arms dangling loosely she followed him to his mothers house ossie lee came into the house stepping over children and around beds and ducking electrical wires he laid across the bed she laid down next to him and tried to make him feel better youll see it will be nice well get the hay out put in some windows buy some curtains from the ten cent store he just lay there when he tired of the noises of the house he sat up on the bed come on lets get out of here as they walked slowly up to the cafe she tried to take his hand but he shook his loose he didnt want her hand she couldnt help nothing could help nothing could remove the fact of that hayfilled shack to which he would take his wife they entered the cafe and took seats at a table in the middle of the room she looked around the room for her sister recognizing her in the back she went over to talk with her soon someone put a dime in the music box and the two girls began to dance ossie lee watched his girl she danced with the same ease and enjoyment that she always had but he could not come out to her he could no longer lose himself in her dancing he was held too tightly to the hayfilled shack too closely to all the meaningless ditches he had dug as he sat immobile in the chair he grew angry how could she dance like that when she had just seen that place what kind of a fool was she to think that there was anything to be happy about any place on earth to relax as he watched her his anger grew still more and his muscles stiffened he pulled himself up and went outside to get some air he sat down on the steps rested his head on the wall and looked out into the darkness a big hand descended on his shoulder it was his cousin willie c willie c was a tall thin brownskinned man with most of his teeth missing he and ossie had grown up together he leaned his dirty sweating face to within inches of ossie lees hey ossie lee i aint seen you out by yourself in a long time not since you got that little black girl from up on mr mills place i got some old corn whiskey out in the car jake and fats they out there now drinking it all up come on drink some with us before its all gone he pulled at ossie lees shoulder ossie lee said alright man lets go they went around back of the cafe to where the other two men were standing ossie lee helped them to finish off the pint of whiskey which they passed around he drank quickly thanked them and left he went back around into the cafe and took the seat he had had earlier in the evening his girl was at the table laughing and talking with her sister about finding her a husband they tried to include him in the talk but he only grunted when the music started the girls once more got up to dance she asked him you want to dance when he did not answer she went off with her sister again he watched her move and his anger swelled he could not permit her to dance like that not today not in the face of that hayfilled shack ossie lee held himself in his seat for as long as he could by looking the other way by talking to people at the next table but he could not ignore the pounding of the music he could not negate the sound of her laughter as she danced he rose from his chair walked over to his beautiful black girl and slapped her to the floor she got back to her feet but was too stunned to hit back at him again he hit her now in her stomach she doubled over in pain the other people who had been dancing moved back from the couple only the girls sister pushed her way over to her screaming at ossie lee to stop hitting her sister she enclosed her sister in her arms and stared back at ossie lee who was readying to fight her too as he approached them he was stopped by the sound of a gunshot the crowd moved aside for miss lula she placed the barrel of the gun into his side her face was tightly drawn her eyes shining her arms holding steadily to the gun ossie lee dont you touch that girl again in my place if you got something to settle take her home but as long as she is anywhere near where i am you cant hurt her now get out of here he turned to the girl you coming with me she nodded yes the two walked away from the cafe back to his mothers house at home they silently prepared for bed the thin black girl slipped into bed beside her husband he took her in his arms for hours he caressed her aroused her loved her he worked with her until he felt sure that he had given her a baby a baby which would weigh her down and destroy her balance so that she would dance no more the breeze moved in from the lake and across the campus e brisk and with the faint sharp smell of winter only a short time away don watched a leaf break away from a limb and start toward the ground he switched his books to his left hand and let the sounds of people greeting each other as they moved across campus break into his thoughts he realized again how natural it had all seemed and how he took such things for granted in high school so many centuries ago it must be at least that long but he knew it had been only a short time longer than a month when he had first reported for early freshman football practice it had been lonely as only a college campus can be without studentsdeserted empty stagnant it was as different from the same place as a football with no air discarded and forgotten during the summer months hed known it would be different when the students began returning for registration and it had been he found for the first time that the difference between loneliness in a place without people and loneliness in a crowd is a difference in intensity it was a comparison of pain such as the difference between a shin splintthat dull annoying ache along the shin bone that comes from running too much on hard ground that could be forgotten completely in the gameand the sharp biting pain from a pulled muscle that slowed you down and held you back no matter how tightly taped loneliness was pain and like all pain you could learn to live with it but he could never quite forget its first bite when the crowd of returning students first gathered in the union snack shack he stood in the surging laughing crowd and he had never felt so lost as in the shouts of greeting and the inquiries of how the summers had been spent he hadnt even had the compensation of being one of the many other freshmen who could share misery of being new alone and so on the outside of things because he had been on the campus early and had registered two weeks before and when the newcomers had been drawn to others like themselves recognized from the endless registration lines to enviously watch the easy closeness of the upperclassmen over a coke he was shagging punts on the practice field he entered the snack shack in the union basement and waited in line for a coke he walked into the lounge and scanned the crowd for a familiar face and walked toward terry bates who had been his roommate in the athletic barracks until hed been cut from the squad because he was too slow for a tformation fullback and too small for a lineman terry had pledged his older brothers fraternity and moved into the house and he hadnt seen much of him since he walked to the table spoke sat down and was introduced to terrys pledge brothers talk about the team and the coming season drifted into the party at the house that weekend and he was glad that he no longer had to contribute because ann bennett came in laughing in that fresh easy manner as always with that easy glide that had caught his eye the first day of practice anns father was a member of the faculty and she had been on the campus before the other students began to arrive her father had been an allconference quarterback some years back and ann was often with him she had led an orientation tour early the first week and was in his english and history classes and on this basis he developed a speaking acquaintance that had advanced to the smalltalk stage and hed called a few times and had been refused a date and the more he saw of her the more he wanted to see of her his glass was empty and so was the talk at the table so he got up and walked toward anns table in high school he had always laughed at the way fellows would describe the trouble they had talking to a girl they happened to like but now he felt just as he did before the kickoff for a big game hi ann how are you hi she returned and her smile tied his stomach into knots hows english coming finished your theme for the week well just about ill probably finish it tonight and he wondered what to say next if she didnt ask him to sit down he could feel her friends staring at him and he wondered what they were thinking and he felt his palm moist on his books he found he was looking to see the color of her eyes they were a deep dark brownalmost black he suddenly knew she wouldnt ask him to sit down and he moved off stammering something about the english assignment who was that ann hes kinda cute gee i dont know i can never remember his name hes in my english class hes only a freshman though she pondered a moment she should know his name it wasnt important however anyone want another coke im going over to the counter don watched as his ankles were being taped and felt himself beginning to withdraw it would keep up like this until everything around him would be hazy and far off and he would be almost sleepy he always wondered about the pregame tension being described as butterflies in the stomach because his stomach only felt tight as if he had tensed his muscles and they had frozen stiff it would be like this until he was hit or threw a block or caught a pass and then everything would be all right he pulled on his shoulder pads and tried to think about ann bennett but he couldnt because todays game kept crowding in this was the final scrimmage before the season opened and the freshmen and varsity squads had been combined and divided into equal teams the last squad cut depended on todays performance ann was a question mark but football was no mystery all he wanted was his signal and the ball in his hands he sat on the bench watching the game and waiting to be called he knew there was a question of his being cut in spite of his record in high school because he came from upstate and the conference was made up of smalltown schools and he could easily be another upstate flash who failed to stand up under the tougher competition his high school coach had told him not to worry that everything would be all right once he got into a game he was the type athlete who no one noticed in practice who could never seem to have the drive and the speed and the fire that had every eye on him in a game from the first time he carried the ball his eyes were halfclosed slits now and he almost seemed not to breathe he wanted his hands on the ball and he wanted the sharp clean thrill of body contact the tension built slowly inside him and he could release it only when he was out on the field doing the thing he loved more than anything else he knew he was in the huddle at last and the mixed smell of sharp sweat and green grass quickened his pulse he heard his play called and he licked his lips and almost smiled he moved forward hard and seemed to hear the signal after he started toward the line though he knew it had started his motion the quarterback was almost too slow moving around for the handoff because he had never started as fast in the signal drills theyd run he got the ball and saw the hole open just before he reached the line steve johnson was moving in with that deceptively swift motion that had made him an allamerican line backer don faked to the left saw him hesitate and drove hard to the right he felt an arm slap his leg but he was free and he knew he would go all the way and he could almost taste the feeling he would have when he was in the clear and the goal was coming closer he watched the defensive halfback and safety as he drifted towards the sidelines don looked across the lake and wondered how long it would be before it froze and thought of the picture of the people ice skating on its glazed surface that had looked so inviting in the catalogue the reg istrar had sent him he thought of the girl in his last class who had never spoken to him before and how she smiled so warmly and congratulated him on the game yesterday and of the people he didnt know who had been speaking on the campus all day it was real easy to make it from an outsider to a guy everyone spoke to and smiled atall you had to do was score three touchdowns in a football game it wasnt for him he was the same person nobody had known or cared about the day before and those characters could go jump in the lake before it froze over this was the place the catalogue talked about with the songs and lifelong friendships it had said nothing about bringing along a football to get acquainted with people he suddenly felt so homesick for the crowd at home in the drugstore after practice that he wanted to throw his books across the campus his desk lamp threw weird shadows on the walls and the french book lay open at the same page he had started on an hour before he thought of the girl who had never spoken before and how she told him which dorm she lived in three times in her conversation and how they were having an open house sunday and why didnt he stop over if he had time because shed love to show him the place and maybe they could study together sometime because he seemed to know so much about the subject and she was just lost and how did it feel to score three touchdowns in one game and she bet he would make allamerican his first season just like the papers said he thought of all the people who suddenly knew his name and smiled and waved on the campus and of terrys brother who had urged him to come to the rush next week because he felt he was the type man his fraternity sought it was real easythree touchdowns he heard his buzz from the bell on the wall and walked to the phone in the hall it was ann and he felt his palms begin to sweat why hadnt he called lately and how did he like the campus and how was english coming along and congratulations on his wonderful performance and then it was hard remembering the rest it was something about a party that weekend and would he like to be her date and he was hating himself more than her for saying yes three touchdowns he walked back to the room and the bitterness was a knot in his throat and he thought of calling her and breaking the date he thought of this idea and smiled at her imagined reaction he sat down at the desk and read awhile he stopped and stood up walked to the door and fingered through his ties the blue gray and red would go well with his new charcoal suit he would have to look sharp this weekend for those with hearty appetites for violence it is no longer necessary to stay awake half the night watching late late shows on television nowadays one only has to tune in a newscast to see the sights and hear the sounds of violence in american society there is sufficient variety to satisfy every taste or proclivity and for those who prefer a less vicarious violence than the news of the day offers more direct exposure and excitement are readily available for example one might want to spend the january or spring collegiate holidays at some beach where students congregate to riot or later in the season go to newport for all the jazzgovernor wallace of alabama who is no novice about violence has recommended a ride on a philadelphia subway since should you not witness an assault or have the fortune to be attacked there is at least the chance of being bitten by a police dog according to the new york daily news which also betrays an affection for violence those who would prefer their action aboveground should take a stroll in central park at night italianamericans can seek membership in the mafia while white gentile protestants as usual have the most options since they are eligible for the american nazi party the minutemen the ku klux klan and the john birch society with the right connections in certain localities careers in violence are apparently still possible in the teamsters union those who would be victims rather than aggressors need only burn their draft cards the young and hardy can enlist in the marines and with any sort of luck end up in vietnam as perhaps a final resort one can become a cop and seek assignment to occupation duty in one of the black ghettos of the urban north all this of course is only a way of saying that violence is manifold and commonplace in american society it seems always to have been so in the colonial protests for fair taxation and political independence and in the revolution itself in the indian wars and the conquest of the frontier in the war between the states and the trauma of the reconstruction crisis in the emergence of the labor union movement and in the era of prohibitionto mention but a handful of historical examplesas well as in the present day whether violence is more widespread today than in earlier times i seriously doubt but how could any accurate measurement possibly be made whether there is a pattern of violence peculiar to our time which did not previously exist i equally doubtprobably no one really knows whether the violence modern society suffers is more vehement than in other periods is impossible to assess what is most significantly different today is that communications are virtually instantaneous the whole country watched ruby shoot oswald the impact of the incidents and images of violence is immediate upon the consciousness if not always upon the consciences of citizens everyone saw the troopers savagely charge then lash and gas and stomp the selma marchers on black sunday in march of all knew immediately when and how and who murdered jonathan daniels the watts riot kept millions watching their tv sets what is different now is that the facts of violence cannot be ignored or rationalized or suppressed or even distorted too much because there are so many onlookers to every violence that makes it difficult to accountin a rational wayfor the popularity especially among the white middle classes in both north and south of the falsehood which equates civil_rights demonstrations with violence in the streets one recalls however that this mistaken notion has had faint echoes from ordinarily responsible quarters notably in statements of former president truman ridiculing civil_rights demonstrations such as the selma march and in some of the general lamentations for former president eisenhower about the disruption of law and order before that however the alleged equation of civil_rights protests and violence gained notorious currency in the presidential campaign indeed this propaganda became so abrasive and blatantly exploitive that senator goldwater himself was moved to repudiate some of his campaign material as racist that repudiation has not of course prevented others most notably the john birchers from persevering in the same savage lie the truth however is that violence initiated by negro and other citizens in the civil_rights movement has been rare and minimalso farespecially so if the scope duration and depth of the protests are taken into account the overwhelming number of acts of violence in the american racial crisis has been instigated and executed by white people their murders tortures mutilations and bombings of negroes have almost always been perpetrated with impunity if not actually accomplished either directly or collusively by the police authorities themselves from through the end of there have been sixtyone homicides directly related to civil_rights as to which there has yet to be a single conviction for murder or manslaughter it is not possible to ascertain how many other homicides have been committed which have never even been reported on a police blotter no plaintive rationalizations can erase that dismal record no amount of whitewash can conceal that much blood the violence that has erupted in which negroes have taken the initiativeso farhas been in the riots and skirmishes in the ghettos of northern cities it is hard to determine what degree of violence is necessary to have classification as a riot but by my own calculation there have been seventeen ghetto riots in and whatever the computation these incidents have not beenso far associated with any civil_rights demonstrations as such there remains an urgent need for an objective inquiry into the causes of the riots they cannot fairly be blamed upon negro civil_rights leaders in fact negro civil_rights leaders have done much more than any others both to curtail the riots and to work on the scene inside the ghettos after the riots have been quelled bayard rustin dissuaded some in the harlem riots from exploding a cache of dynamite that was capable of obliterating an entire city block dick gregory was wounded while pleading for a halt to the rioting in watts the southern christian leadership conference has established a beachhead in chicagos black belt and the northern student movement has been working for months in several eastern cities to forestall or ameliorate riotprone tensions the negro civil_rights leaders who have been committed for so long to the ethics and tactics of nonviolence recognize of course that the riots immediately pose a threat to their philosophy and strategy of social change they also realize what apparently most white people cannot comprehendthat nonviolence can prevail in the negro revolution only if it yields significant results perhaps malcolm_x the assassinated leader of the black muslims knew this truth better than anyone he was much misunderstood and editorially maligned as an advocate of violence this is not true he doubted that passive resistance would bring substantive progress foreseeing that it might evoke a greater recalcitrance toward change among the whites in the face of that prospect he did not advocate aggressive violence by negroes against white society but he did uphold the conviction that when a man is assaulted he has the dignity and right to defend himselfone of the most vulnerable principles of anglosaxon common law i am an episcopalian not a quaker although i trust a peaceful man i am not an ideological pacifist i do not assume that all violence is the same or that every incident of violence is to be uncritically deplored or that one may never revolt or that a christian may never be found in violence most likely the american democracy could not have been constituted in the first place without the revolution and nowhere in the world has it been easy to overthrow colonialism without violence the conscience of bonhoeffer involved him in a conspiracy to assassinate the head of state in his countryadolf hitlerand both in his life and in his death jesus christ was not a stranger to violence at least this should suggest that there are different sorts of violence no attempt is made here at any exhaustive or definitive analysis of the ethics of violence but the history of american social protest teaches us that an important distinction exists between intentional deliberate tactical violence on one hand and unpremediated spontaneous sporadic violence on the other for example in the early part of the labor revolution especially in the s both those in protest and those defending the status quo engaged in willful violence as a means of pursuing their respective social aims for both sides violence became integral to strategy and was thought to be the necessary and effective way of achieving certain objectives the northern ghetto riots of the rep resent a very different kindofjviolence they havenot beertpremeditated acts but have incarnated a violence of despair they represent a spontaneous violence nobody planned or plotted these riots no one conspired beforehand no one calculated that such violence would gain anything for anybody they were not the work as the fbi itself has repeatedly confessedof professional agitators disgruntled beatniks adolescent hoodlums black supremists or communiststhough once the fires of revolt were ignited it would have been astonishing indeed if some attempts were not made to feed the flames it is also significant that up to now the violence of the ghetto riots has been internalized what happened took place inside the ghettos and did not represent a direct assault upon white society or white property or white people in this sense the riots have been a symbolic violence the day when the despair of ghettoized negro citizens turns into wrath will be the day that someone tries to blow up city hall or burn down a white department store or sabotage an urban rapid transit system that will be the day when the violence of despair is no longer internalized and confined inside the ghettos but becomes open insurrection against white society almost all the riotsso farhave been occasioned by comparatively trivial and superficially unrelated provocations the two exceptions are in chicago and new york in chicago in the summer of a negro woman was fatally injured by a fire truck being operated in a grossly negligent manner there was no driver for the rearladder apparatus in new york in the summer of a negro boy was shot and killed in the presence of scores of other school children by an offduty white policeman in circumstances which to say the very least were extremely ambiguous in both these cases there had been serious incidents human beings had been either mortally injured or killed in the other cases howeverin trenton new jersey springfield massachusetts in watts in los angelesthe occasions for riot were relatively inconsequential and in some cases actually innocuous in rochester new york for example a man and his wife evidently drunk were arguing with each other on the sidewalk and were properly arrested for disorderly conduct by the police in philadelphia there was an ordinary traffic violation and the arresting officer was a negro such common and apparently insignificant incidents were enough nevertheless to kindle into riot the accumulated and inherited passions frustrations hostilities grievances hurts and pains of an imprisoned people in other words these northern city riots are a most radical form of violence perhaps the most volatile there can be unpremeditated unpredictable without tactical goals undisciplined chaotic without focus or definite purpose a spontaneous combusion of fury that is the mood which now threatens to overwhelm the civil_rights movement despair is probably the most pathetic human response of all because it operates on the assumption that there is no honest hope of meaningful change how can we ask the negro to believe that their everyday lives are about to be transformed and that their fragile dreams will not again be shattered despair in the ghettos can no longer be appeased by promises and pronouncements about gradual improvements despair expresses the defeat of human expectations for society now that it has been unleashed it will not be easily or quickly distracted not even by war much less deterred or displaced the despair which spawns the violence of the american ghettos is nourished as much by the apathy of white society as by the abominable conditions of ghetto existence the despair of urban negro citizens is as profound as the apathy of white citizens is obstinate no more appropriate symbols of the apathy of the american white establishment exist than in the incumbent political administrations of the principal northern cities warned of impending trouble in watts in the spring of mayor yorty of los angeles refused assistance from federal trouble shooters which had been offered by representatives of the war on poverty mayor daley shortly before the first chicago riot in publicly boasted that there were no ghettos in chicago in boston a militant racist mrs louise hicks has fashioned a promising political career by her skillful manipulation of the apathy and latent racism of white parents thereby entrenching her personal power in the school committee and evidencing her availability for the mayoralty office equally typical was the response of mayor wagner of new york to the harlem riots of the summer of after that trouble had been ruthlessly suppressed by the police the mayor called a press conference at which he stated that the unrest in harlem had some connections with the conditions in which the people there lived from day to day he mentioned the decrepit ratinfested tenements the obsolete academically inferior schools the shortage of jobs the absence of equal opportunity he even suggested that something should be done at the end of his administration a year and a half later however nothing had been done categorically and literally nothing in this respect new york is not unique among the great cities of the nation but it represents the epitome of white apathy if the promises of white people are regarded by negro citizens as not only empty but perhaps calculated deceptions and if the white mayors and other public representatives are thought to be somewhat shrewd if not very subtle cynics more than any other single thing it is the complacency of white society and the city halls they still dominate which is responsible for the secret premise the hidden assumption the unstated commitment the unconscious sentiment of most earnest wellintentioned lawabiding churchgoing peaceloving moderate white citizens is that the circumstances of life within the black ghettos should be improved somehow but that the ghettoization of society will indefinitely remain most white citizens are as yet not pathological in their attitudes toward negroes they are not vulgar and vicious racists but they have been reared in an ethos of white supremacy for so long that ghettoization is assumed as normative they have the idea that the racial unrest in society is due to an insufficient degree of white paternalism not yet realizing that parternalism is itself a form of racism what most whites who are not militant racists envision when they hear the words integration or civil_rights is a time when a significant empirical betterment of places like harlem and woodlawn and watts will have been achieved they entertain images of black ghettos becoming decent and pleasant habitations what white moderates do not realize is that they themselves are ghettoized not only racially but physically in the places where they live and study and work and play and worship and also in their minds and mentalitiesand hence in their morality white moderates are still enamored with the possibility of a society in which there is equality but separation not understanding that equality is inherently incompatible with the radical division of society by race in the basic spheres of life and that it represents an inequality suffered on both sides of the racial barrier whites who fondly assume that negroes prefer to live with their own kind must face the fact that it will only be when negro citizens have free access to reside and work and study and vote and live wherever they please that such a proposition can be seriously tested what incites despair inside the black slums is manifestly the failure to remedy glaring inequities in housing education and employment part of the secret of such despair is found in the profound psychological emotional and moral insularity of white people who complacently assume that such places as harlemeven if somewhat improvedwill continue to be ghettos indeed the atrocities of white racists in the deep south are probably easier to bear than the recalcitrance and ingenuity of white paternalism in the urban north this accounts in part for the strong reaction within the negro community to the celebrated moynihan report which had been advanced as the basis for deliberations at the white house conference on civil_rights and was properly controverted by dr benjamin f payton now executive director commission on religion and race national council of churches the moynihan report prepared by daniel p moynihan while he was assistant secretary of labor argues that the legal barriers to the assimilation of negro citizens have been substantially removed but that the critical obstacle that remains to integration is the breakdown of the negro family structure ajid tjie emasculation of the american negro male such a position is not exactly untrue but it is terribly incomplete and misleading unless placed alongside other important factors the moynihan report uncritically assumes that the inherited white family institution and the patterns of assimilation appreciable to white immigrants are the criteria of social stability which should and can overcome the disintegration of negro family life without acknowledging inherent strengths in the negro family though moynihan himself is obviously no racist and is a strong advocate of an immediate policy of total employment his report inadvertently furnishes a subtle rationale for the continuance of white paternalism it represents a halftruth because it fails to take note of the decadence of the american white family as it may casually relate to the plight of the american negro family or as an appropriate standard for a socially mature family structure as such of course if a moynihantype report were writtenas it well could beon the parallel breakdown in the white family structure in america and its accompanying defeminization of the white female it is unlikely that the white house would convene a national conference but in any case the racial ghettoization of society will only be more cruelly entrenched by any efforts to make negro families into facsimile white families what is needed to absolve despair is the determination that there be an end to ghettos every ghetto blights every city and town in this land with a negro population must be erased only by beginning with that commitmentand there are few signs that white citizens are even contemplating such a commitmentis there a serious possibility of conceiving and executing public policies which can at once free the prisoners of the black ghettos and emancipate white americans from the ghetto of their own complacency the ghettos must go both white and black must be freed from their imprisonments but what does that imply in terms of concrete public policies while i have no panaceas the most significant change would be a conversion in the mentalities of both white and negro citizens as for a black ghetto like harlem it is now so congested so deteriorated and so insufferable as to be mostly beyond rehabilitationa place unfit for human habitation but to destroy the harlem ghetto rather than futilely to patch it up would mean that the existing population of harlem would have to be dispersed and relocated elsewhere in the city and more than likely in the suburbs in localities where from the outset of the dispersion there would have to be integrated housing education and employment opportunities legitimate questions could be asked of course about whether society has the right to uproot people from where they now live and relocate them somewhere else but it seems that this is the practical reality wherever citizens are consigned to places like harlem no doubt white neighborhoods and schools and businesses in communities where dispersed negroes would find many patterns of society threatened or changed in such a process but the answer to that is that the bourgeois white ghettos must also be erased if this is to be integratedor simply a human society perhaps dispersion is not an appropriate remedy but it is an imaginable step and one that could be undertaken in fact it is the sort of policy that might well be considered if the moral commitment of this society became one of abolishing the ghettos instead of merely at best preserving and improving them the important thing is that integration means the disruption and rejection of much that has been taken for granted for many generations in americaa drastic reappraisal of values which has not yet been even theoretically contemplated while i mean to furnish no comfort whatever to the pathological racist among white americansto those of the ku klux klan or the john birch society or others whose reason has been pervertedlet it be nevertheless confessed that there is no serious ethical distinction between such racism and the more benign and more secretive white supremacy so common among the great multitudes of moderate middleclass whites no doubt there are aesthetic differences a mayor daley or a mayor yorty is not as vulgar a person as a bull connor or a governor wallace on the other hand a wallace seems far more candid than a yorty of course there is an aesthetic difference between those who have bombed negro churches in the black belt or those who have shot at civil_rights workers and those whose dividend income is gained in fact if not intentionally from speculation in slum real estate or investment in enterprises which practice de facto discrimination in hiring advertising customer services and the like but the differenceat least in new testament termsis one of aesthetics not ethics the massive indifference of the ordinary white citizen of good intentions is the moral equivalent of the perfidy of the white racists the profound apathy of the white moderates is ethically tantamount to the radical impudence of the white racists that the difference between the pathological racists and the socalled moderates in either north or south is a matter of aesthetic distinction rather than ethical significance can be documented in all too many ways in the colleges and universities of the north for all their venerable liberal traditions there is almost universally only token integration this has now been achieved even in most southern colleges and universities with a few exceptionsdartmouth is onethere is no significant evidence of any inclination to move beyond tokenism in higher education in either section of the country or to address the issue which realistically remains the chief barrier to admission of qualified negroes to college the cost of tuition and room and board despite all the dropouts among negro secondaryschool students there remain thousands of negro students qualified for college who do not goor even applybecause the costs of higher education are prohibitive other factors affect the collegiate admission of negro students too many with college potential are diverted early in their public education into vocational and commercial courses many are reluctant to attend overwhelmingly white schools and become exhibition negroes conventional recruitment and admissions procedures are often designed in a way which disadvantages the negro applicant because built into those interviewing and testing practices is the unarticulated assumption that the applicant will be a white middleclass type much as a female applicant for law school is at a disadvantage because admissions formalities are still geared to male applicantsyet in the face of the most urgent need for increased access to higher educational training for negroes one repeatedly encounters the pathetically unrealistic rationalization of professing white liberals that negro students already qualified for college entrance should be spared special preference in admissions lest they suffer reverse discrimination when in fact the effective barrier to their admission is simply lack of money there is also the gruesomely hypocritical matter of church investments where mission boards denominational institutions local congregations and parishes synodical and other regional authoritiesnot to mention legions of individual churchgoershave the audacity to utter praises to the name of christ whileagain with a bare sprinkling of exceptions profiting financially from a racism as evidenced by their endowment investments and by their current contracting hiring and spending policies as to that there is no important difference between the actual social witness on the side of racial segregation and discrimination among the churches and their related agencies in any part of the country or again the moral kinship between the moderate and the professed racist can be seen by comparing the political regimes which both support and the similarity in tactics with respect to the racial crisis practiced by those administrators both in the northern cities and in the southern hinterlands just consider those tactics as they have unfolded in the racial strife in both parts of the country separation in both north and south regimes depend upon the separation of society between the ghetto and the rest of the society in order both to nurture a mentality of acquiescence and a capacity to endure hardship among the ghetto residents on one hand and to supply the ignorance and prejudicial stereotypes of other citizens about the ghetto people on the other concealment in both there must be substantial concealment of the suffering and deprivation of negro citizens by keeping the actual conditions of ghetto existence out of the convenient sight of white citizens a necessity often met by the routing of traffic under over around but never through the blighted section toleration demonstrations for equal rights while undesirable must often be tolerated within the ghetto where sometimes they tend to relieve tension but seldom impress the people outside marches however outside the ghettos must if possible be stamped out suppression if violence does occur it must at all costs be localized within the ghetto and be suppressed by overwhelming force in the name of course of preserving law order and domestic tranquility rationalization when trouble does occur the authorities must be quick to locate a scapegoat in harlem hoodlums or drug addicts are always handy in alabama blame the communists and outside agitators they must be sure in applying this principle to repeat the scapegoat charges after the trouble subsides in order to impress the people outside and just as important in order to provide them with an excuse for any future violence proscrastination appease everybody by promising anything usually the ghetto people will be quiet for a while if a delegation is received at the executive mansion allowed to refer to grievances which in such a reception will be understated generalized and vague and solicited with a few indefinite assurances that whatever should be done will be done sometimes inviting the delegation to pose for news photographs ameliorates tension and abets evasion in case of emergency however keep promising to get to the bottom of things and to cure any legitimate ills or evils if pressed further though it is unlikely appoint a committee if truly desperate try to keep ones head and name a commission because it sounds more important and impartial of prominent citizens to investigate an investigation has an automatic virtually magical effect since people still suppose that investigation is a synonym for decisive action distraction the maneuver is to be employed especially by mayors or governors in times of crisis attention can be preempted for example by staging a parade for astronauts or by denouncing air pollution or engaging in harmless controversy with a politician in the other party tactics such as theseall too common in both north and south cater to white apathy and thereby show contempt for the selfinterest of those who are white and prosperous as much as for the rights of those who are black and poor perhaps only a psychiatrist could fathom the meaning of white apathy in the racial crisis to me however the most significant single factor in the present situation as ghetto violence embodies the profound despair of negro people is that the apathy of the great majority of white citizens may itself be a parallel form of despair realism enlightened selfinterest human reasonall argue convincingly for the constructive involvement of white citizens in working the social changes required to banish poverty abolish the ghettos and rehabilitate the nation economically socially and politically as one society but apathy prevails the reason cannot be any lack of public information or absence of warning about the crisis it has been almost literally impossible during the past decade to read a newspaper or watch a newscast without gaining some awareness of the scope and ominous potentialities of the racial struggle no white citizen including those who still live in communities where there are no negro residents can plead ignorance to excuse noninvolvement perhaps white citizens have received some sort of mass inoculation perhaps in fact they have become so conscious of what is decadent in this society so sensitive to the magnitude of the racial crisis so aware of how many assumptions of white society are threatened so astute about the upheaval in their own existence that would be wrought by significant integration of american public life that they have become paralyzed so they read the news of demonstrations and see photographs of riots and hear the cries of the poor but can no longer understand any of these things allowing themselves to become victims of the repeated lies of the racists or despairing of finding anything they can do which would not risk their property their status or their very lives if they do not themselves become racists they remain mute pretend that the problem is somewhere else fasten onto ingenious rationalizations remind themselves that they are personally innocent of any offense toward black men or revert to the banalities of brotherhood observances no one escapes this debilitating fatigue in some form or other i know that i am sick and tired of the racial crisis god knows how negroes must feel but i as a white man am now almost overwhelmed with the feeling that i do not want to hear anything more about it or see anything more of it or do anything more in it i wish it could somehow be escaped or evaded or avoided there was another great crisis that this nation endured within my own recollection and about which i felt somewhat the same during the korean war i was in the military service though mercifully i was not stationed in korea or called into combat but nevertheless i vividly rememberas many others also mustan acute fatigue in which i did not want to hear or see or do anything more about that awful war i wanted it to somehow evaporate and make no more demands on me i am pretty sure that this sentiment which was fairly prevalent did not alleviate or abbreviate that war in any way on the contrary if anything it must have contributed to its aggravation and prolongation something similar is true now in the american racial crisis wish it would end without my being any longer or any more deeply involved i would rather escape from what now happens to this nation yet i am certain both in my mind and in my guts that this exhaustion will not hasten the resolutionmuch less reconciliationof the racial crisis it can only frustrate and compound iteveryone in the united states is now involved in the racial crisis if there ever was an option on this subject it has expired the only issue that remains is how one is involved obstinately stupidly irrationally or with concern intelligence and compassion on that matter let us at last face some simple truths the racial crisis is not a good cause in the sense of some conventional charity like cancer research or aid for victims of disaster let whites renounce the romanticism of good works and the preposterous condescension of socalled liberalism no white man is doing a favor for any negro citizen by now advocating the ordinary rights of citizenship for the american negro in if such involvement constitutes favor it is as much for the selfinterest of whites as for any negro citizen the negro revolution must be considered within the context of the ethics and traditions of american social revolution there is no great novelty to social revolution in america and if the present crisis is seen as part of this history an astonishing fact emerges all earlier revolts were characterized by the ethics and tactics of violence until the negro revolution with the possible exception of the woman suffrage movement the women were apparently nonviolent in their demonstrations in the streets considering the vast numbers of citizens involved in the present revolution and the depth of their provocation it is incredible thatso farthe negro revolution has been for so long dominated by the ethics and tactics of nonviolence the dimensions of the negro revolution are such that the very survival of the nation is at issue the life and livelihood of every citizen is at stake however damaging it may be morally and psychologically the united states can probably survive even while continuing to exclude the american indian from the mainstream of its political and economic life politically and economically the exile from american society of the indian is hardly noticed but the denial to twentytwo million negro citizens of decent housing educational opportunity gainful employment political responsibility and free access to public accommodations is bound to threaten the survival of the nation for everybody the exclusion of that many citizens from society jeopardizes the political freedom economic solvency psychological stability and moral integrity of those who are not excluded just as much as those who are white people must finally wake up to the fact that their own welfare is quite as much at issue as that of the negro at least let profound selfinterest in the nations survival finally end the paternalism of white men for black men in these united states civil disobedience is not uncommon among americans there are probably very few citizens who have not in one way or another indulged in acts of civil disobedienceespecially in realms of the law concerning taxes traffic liquor sales and consumption gambling and sex the laws of some jurisdictions invite disobedience by evasionas in the case of new york states divorce laws all citizens need to remember as we observe daytoday developments in the racial crisis how widespread civil disobedience really is of course there are different forms of civil disobedience until the riots the civil disobedience characteristic of the negro revolution for the most part has been such that those who have disobeyed state and local lawsagainst which they were protestinghave willingly borne the consequences of their disobedience they have submitted to arrest endured prosecution served jail sentences and paid fines even in their disobedience they have upheld the rule of law the other form of civil disobedience opposes and denounces the rule of law as such and is not only a disobedience to existing law but an attempt to overthrow the rule of law by taking the law into ones own hands this is the civil disobedience of the lynch mob the assassin the birmingham bomber this is the civil disobedience that so far has been maily practiced in the racial crisis by whitesespecially in the south but not only thereand to which all too often the police authorities themselves have been privy the negro revolution is the eye of the hurricane but it is not the whole storm it is the most intense focus of contemporary social crisis but that crisis involves many other citizens all those who are poor all those who are sick and uncared for all those who are old and unwanted all those who are young and neglected all those whose skill and labor are made obsolete by automationall those in other words who have either been cast off or outcast in americaall those for whom the promises of freedom and humanity and society remain unredeemed in america in the twentieth century that the crisis is acutely dramatized in the situation of the negro citizen does not mean that if there were no negroes in america or if the negroes continued to acquiesce in their own humiliation and oppres sion this nation would escape the reformation that history now forces upon it the truth is rather that american negroes have become the authentic pioneers of a reconstruction of american society sorely even pathetically needed by all americans and of which we will all be beneficiaries should it come to pass but will it come to pass that is ominously doubtful it is now about twelve years since the negro revolution broke into the headlines and has evidenced organization and direction there have been all these years of peaceful protest sitins and freedom rides and picketing and prayer vigils and marches in that time thousands of citizens have been arrested thousands have lost their jobs thousands have suffered shame and humiliation in the churches in schools in the courts in hotels and parks and other public places even in their own homes in the pursuit of their rights as citizens the question which now plagues the civil_rights movement is whether the ethics and tactics of nonviolence have been vindicated in results it is a very american a very pragmatic question which now overtakes the negro revolution what does the american negro citizen have to show for these long years of unparalleled dignity and humanity and restraint in the south they have to show the decomposed remains of those sixtyone human beings some negroes some whites who sought to help citizens there to register to vote or who joined in peaceful demonstrations and protests and who were murdered for it and whose murderers have gone free hundreds of citizens can show you the scars on their bodies where they have been branded by cattle prods or bruised by police clubs or bitten by dogs in one sixmonth period in one southern jurisdiction alone more than forty churches and homes were bombed and burned and like the homicides this terrorism remains unpunished if that furnishes a macabre consolation to any northern citizens it need notnot any moreafter one counts the homicides committed by the police during the northern ghetto riots and the multiple indignities which ghetto citizens endure in the north every day in both parts of the country it is true there is now token integration in some schools and in most colleges and universities but tokenism is all it is almost anywhere meanwhile the churches remain steadfastly segregated with but rare exceptions and the unions have been far slower to desegregate than many businesses the congressional legislation of and the civil_rights act and the voting rights billhave been the two most tangible results of the pressures of peaceful protest the former was at least responsive to the march on washington the latter to the selmamontgomery march yet the impact of both of these measures as necessary as each was and as significant as both are has been chiefly localized in the south there even before the public accommodations section in many cities white businessmen had acknowledged the breakdown of segregation as an economic institution and had voluntarily opened their shops and restaurants and hotels to negroes though comparatively few southern negroes can afford to patronize them regularly in the northern jurisdictions local legislation had long since pretty much covered the scope of the new federal laws and the patterns of de facto segregation had long since been established thus the new federal acts have had little practical impact when therefore the pragmatic question is askedhave the tactics of nonviolence yielded significant restiltsthe truthful answer must be much more so in the south than in the north but only at afl eoimous cost in death and human suffering and nonviolence has not produced generally changes in the practical daytoday lives and livelihoods of the ordinary negro citizens of the land while only that sort of change can possibly vindicate the nonviolent leadership in the civil_rights movement thus the negro revolution has been plunged into a profound tactical crisis marches and sitins have never been as effective tactically in the north as they have been in the south and when other forms of peaceful protestlike the school boycotts advocating the bussing of students to achieve integration and quality educationhave been attempted in the north they have met with massive opposition from the incumbent political authorities and school boards as well as from white parents and teachers white intransigence has frustrated most forms of peaceful protest in the north and has in fact served to discredit nonviolence as a viable means of social protest meanwhile as the vietnam war has expanded and the demonstrations against that war have become more numerous and frequent many civil_rights advocates committed to nonviolence are bewildered as to what can be done tactically because they see that the antiwar movement has elicited such a wide public hostility to peaceful demonstrations about anything in this same period too the despair of ghetto residents has erupted in violence these pressures make it most difficult to maintain a nonviolence strategy in the tactics and ethics of the negro revolution the kind of social change which has impact upon the practical lives of the multitudes of negro citizens has not been launched by these years of peaceful protest nor is there much evidence it has even entered the minds of most white citizens thus the spirit of revenge is loose to prey upon the frustration and despair which american negroes have inherited from three centuries of slavery and segregation the mood becomes more militant and aggressive and explosive as each moment passes there is the passionate conviction that it is better not to live than to be a negro in the united statesnorth or southso what is to be lost by turning to violent assault upon white society and white property and white people
many of the stereotypes still prevailing about negroes in this country can be traced through books of various kinds written from the middle of the th century to the beginning of the civil war this proslavery antinegro writing made its impact in spite of the mass of literature written against slavery one can only say that it is unfortunate that through books the peculiar institution of slavery was strengthened the writers of these books were just as much a part of the conspiracy as the slave holders although the term slave was not applied to the negro in the early decades of the settlement of this nation the fact remains that the colonists looked upon the negro servant slave and even free man as inferiors oscar handlin documents the fact that although slavery was not legally fixed until around the institution of slavery nevertheless was in existence and in looking at the literature of colonial america one will find it explicit colonial writers viewed negroes as inferior and different many of them said yes inculcate piety so as to save the black mans soul but remember he will never be equal cotton mather that great new england puritan certainly wanted to christianize the negro but ironically he nevertheless assumed the negros incapacity for freedom john woolman the quaker minister in an antislavery pamphlet stated the blacks seem far from being kinfolk and they are of vile stock yet woolman was a champion of converting and manumitting negroes he offered an ingenious defense of converting slaves conversion would serve as a measure of control thomas paine and thomas jefferson demonstrated their thoughts on the subject of the equality of black men in their writings perhaps jeffersons philosophy is the most glaring incongruity of all when comparing the slave in this country with the roman slave in his notes on virginia he stated that among the romans emancipation required but one effort the slave when made free might mix without straining the blood of the master but with us a second is necessary unknown to history when freed he is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture jefferson went on to prove his point about the distinctions between black and white men by concluding that nature not slavery produced the distinctions he injected a pseudobiological basis into the argument when he stated besides those of color figure and hair there are other physical distinctions proving differences of race they blacks have less hair on the face and body they secrete less by the kidneys and more by the glands of the skin which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odor jefferson like woolman advocated manumission of the slaves but also in the same breath he suggested returning them to africa for this manumission this ambiguous attitude towards negroes was in fact the basis of condescension among so called colonial liberals and even much later the separate but equal theory negroes know so well today there were those writers who felt the racial barrier had to be strengthened in the colonies particularly since slaves were learning to speak english and were becoming christians which of course was a threat of cultural assimilation some wrote popular tracts which were widely read on the negro being inferior because of his life in africa which inferred the worship of snakes and exotic objects this theme of the negros inferiority and godlessness persisted in books as late as charles carrols notorious the negro a beast or in the image of god which was published in during the last decades of the th century americans began to write novels as would be expected the first novels were heavily influenced by the novelists of england and had little concern for the realities of life in this country whenever a negro character appeared he was a shadowy figure looming in the background only a few writers attempted to attack slavery in their novels and unfortunately their works were not read widely in the north and certainly much less if at all in the south after and prior to the civil war there were those writers who included negro characters but described them as the mammy with the bright varicolored turban spotless apron and eversmiling face the uncle and the banjoplaying minstrel of the plantation slavery was depicted as benevolent and necessary for a childlike peoples transition from savagery to christianity these writers were convinced that the brutality of slavery existed only in the minds of fanatical yankees because the southerner was of a gentler breed sterling brown stated it accurately when he said that the writers of the plantation tradition felt that the grownup slaves were contented the pickinnies were frolicking the steamboat was hooting around the bend god was in heaven and all was right with the world the proslavery writers had as their model j p kennedys novel swallow barn a poorly written work which could be classed as a modest best seller of that day kennedy depicts negroes as clowns essentially parasitical and happy as long as the meddling abolitionists left them alone it is interesting to note that many of the kennedytype novels were written by women one northern woman writer married to a southerner celebrated the mammy she had her leading character comment to her husband oh my husband i never dreamed that slavery could present an aspect so tender and affectionate in this work the husbands slaves are shown as fat sleek and full of laughter on sunday at church they are attired in the latest fashions another writer a mrs eastman wrote a bestseller that was popular among the women on the pantation entitled aunt phyliss cabin the book glorifies slavery and denounces abolitionists all of this of course for the slaves welfare one observer of the women writers of the plantation tradition noted that they were too kind to mistreat slaves but nevertheless tarred and feathered and even lynched their characters who were abolitionists indeed a study of the proslavery women writers of that day would be very revealing harriet beecher stowes uncle toms cabin created a mild sensation when it appeared in the three years that followed miss stowes publication there were at least novels published to counteract it w l g smiths life in the south or uncle toms cabin as it is is typical of the antistowe novels which appeared in smiths parody uncle tom is urged to run off to canada by abolitionists upon reaching canada he is placed in slavery again he begs his master to return him to the south which was done out of christian consideration it is inaccurate to suggest that all white authors wrote in an attempt to dehumanize the negro we did have such writers as washington irving and herman melville to name a few irving was a young brisk manabouttown and he recorded his curiosity about the negro in knickerbocker history of new york there is the negro character caesar who perhaps is the first comic negro in american fiction however he is comic in strictly a human sense and crafty and quickwitted as well herman melville has his character pip in moby dick characterized as a coward not because he is black but because he is naturally human in benito cereno we see the noble slave babo plan a revolt aboard a slave ship off the coast of chile babo is shown as a hero and a natural leader other slaves are shown as men willing to fight for their freedom they revolted as mankind has always revolted when subjugated james fenimore cooper has a negro character in the spy who is courageous and in the pioneers he characterizes abraham as a robust free black man who actively takes part in the life of the frontier in his last of the mohicans cora the negro woman is shown as a strong and resourceful character it should be mentioned that prior to the civil war the first novel by a negro was published william wells brown wrote clotei or the presidents daughter browns work was followed by frank webbs the garies and their friends and martin delaney followed webbs work several years later with blake or the huts of america these three novels are noteworthy because they were written by black men at a time when whites were saying that negroes were incapable of learning and in the words of jefferson are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind as can be seen then there were writers prior to who were sympathetic towards the negro and his condition but there were too many writers who were in favor of slavery and who never became convinced that the negro was an equal american literature reveals that these early writers exerted all of their energies in perpetuating the peculiar institution through books wherein the civil war was fought and the slaves emancipated the antinegro books made so great an impact that we are still faced with the consequences of their prejudices which were passed on through the printed word and this too could have y y been a paean but cons y r tradictions abound in our history and there are historical discontinuities fortunately we are constantly inevitably moved moved by the haunting memory of minutes measured in drops of pawned manhood or by the centuriesold whip like a mule desperate bobbingandweaving uphill on this slippery road possessed with frenzied rhythms of passionate desire to grasp this historical moment and redefine man in order to keep moving with clarity so now i want to talk about somebody most of us are familiar with the young selfavowed black revolutionary artist and intellectual he says he has read marx engels lenin guevara mao nkrumah du bois frantz fanon he says he has looked into negritude and though he was somewhat moved and sympathetic he came back with a frown he likes leroi jones plays because they run the crap down like it really is this young man knows about the nature of revolutions and counterrevolutions the world over and is never hesitant to express his hostility to the western world he is so disillusioned with western values he claims that he will never ever trade in his retrieved soul rhythmic reasoning for the western analytic sensibility the upholders and defenders of western christian civilization kill lumumba and his heart bleeds the upholders and defenders of western christian democratic ideals put kaunda kenyatta sobukwe mandela and countless others in jail and his heart bleeds the upholders and defenders of western christian morality kill millions of people in vietnam latin america africa and america and his heart bleeds he probably wishes he had builtin bombs to mow down all these devils that shows a lot of potential but potential which remains potential does not help alleviate or solve anybodys problems potential has to grow and the fruits of that potential have to be realizable in very concrete terms as a way of life hence my accusation i accuse the selfavowed young revolutionary artist and intellectual of negligence or irresponsibility should i say it might even be downright cowardice let me point out here that in ioparticular i am talking about the young afroamerican and the young south african artist and intellectual for a number of reasons in most cases artists from colonial countries have grown up in a notsohighly industrialized urban society the south african and the afroamerican are from highly industrialized societies run by racist capitalist exploiters and judeochristian ethics at all stages of his training right from kindergarten on up the values of the colonized were are systematically destroyed by the oppressor the young colonial subject is trained to look down upon everything that is his he is trained to aspire to the colonialists ideals and to emulate the oppressor his heroes artistic and historical are colonialist the success of the colonialists damaging of our minds is reflected for instance when a young colonial subject watches an american cowboy movie he finds himself without knowing why identifying positively with the white plunderer he even sees the indian who is fighting in defense of his person and his land as the villain by the time he is through the masters college he is so whitewashed and westernoriented he might as well have had a grecoroman ancestry but as much of european culture as he assimilates he finds himself still a nigger in the eyes of the oppressor exceptional maybe or different but still a nigger to the oppressor this frustrates him and he begs the oppressor to accept him for he is ashamed to go back to his people because he looks down upon them the african in what the oppressor calls the underdeveloped countrymeaning that his country is not western christian industrialized that the people there do not worship the dollar the pound or the franc and the bombdoes not have our hangups he has never mistaken himself for a carboncopy noball whiteman his identity has never been questionable thus what we are faced with demands more discipline more tearing apart of the rot in our minds and very conscious planning the oppressor is not going to say all right fm sorry i was so inhuman when we decide we have had enough of his nonsense he will be more repressive and he will kill us any time we say his game is over anybody who thinks the oppressor will take his hold off our throats when we say it hurts lives under a criminal illusion first the oppressor throws christ and that gloryafterdeath bull on you when that ceases to work he throws money on you or a separate development plan or a civil_rights bill and selects your leaders for you he will pass laws to proscribe whatever you attempt to do if it is not in line with what he prescribes when that fails he throws a bomb on you ask the vietnamese people or any people involved in national liberation wars it is at this point that history calls upon us to try the best we can to fulfill our mission we owe it to the generations that will come after us we owe it to the dead of sharpeville watts and the harlems around the world we owe it to malcolm fanon and the rest of suffering humanity it is at this point that we must clearly realize that our problems are not going to be solved in conference rooms the fight is going to be bloody and our art if it is valid is going to be carved from that portion of history it is going to reflect explore and celebrate the nature of that blood condemnation alone spills no liberatory blood at best condemnation without action remains a tensionreleasing mechanism but people trained under fascist savagery to be so afraid settle for the least bit of comfort but that fear too like all western references must bleed to death all these years our passion and desires have been lying dormant like animals in hibernation or like leafless trees between the winter and the summer not dried up and dead but alive and waiting for the spring to blossom our spring has been here too long and im afraid imperialist floods might ruin us before we bear fruit if we linger here too long but still terror reigns in the mind we are so full of fear where is the decolonized mind many of us realize that the attempt to establish a collective expression of a constructive revolutionary program a pulling together of our heads to work out a new system of values and an unconditional assertion of those valuesnational and international in scopecalls for discipline and responsibility of duty we are afraid to shoulder this responsibility as a result we do not even totally reject the oppressors values we rationalize we become dishonest we are never hesitant to proclaim our identification with the people but our identification remains strictly theoretical because there are no acts to give our statements substance we make an art and claim it is the peoples art but that is questionable it seems as paternalistic a gesture as that of the white liberal the liberal never hesitant to make statements about how justifiable our fight against racist domination is is not willing to fight by any means necessary against oppression and i am afraid the attitude of some people who claim to be black artists is similar to that of the liberal recently i asked a group of colleagues if they believed most of our art was truly with the people theres a thing like selling black you know and it seems like its a commodity very much in demand in liberal circles one of them replied man dont be so naive you still think them niggers is worth dying for please note that this attitude is not representative but it exists among people who write what they never hesitate to call black poetry then there are those who do not do much more than talk about or quote marx if that is one of the best things we can do for our liberation we are in bad shape look i do not have anything against marx in fact i like him he is one of the few europeans who tried to make the white sensibility human for those selfstyled nationalists who are as antisocialist as the oppressor let me point out here that there is a difference between socialist political and economic theory and the historical sellingout of known communistsi mean cardcarrying ones every nation in the world today which rejects western racist ideologies operates from a socialist economic and political base what we have to clearly realize though is that for the solution of our problems conventional marxism is inadequate we do not have a class problem this does not mean that there is no black bourgeoisie but they do not have any kind of power in decisionmaking bodies which have shoved us where we are they are insignificant toolsshowcase stooges for the oppressor to use in defense of his sinister ways if we had a purely class problem if poverty was the major problem to be solved in a rich country like america or south africa the poor regardless of color or race would necessarily have been reasonably united and fighting together to eliminate poverty but our problem is both economic and racial at the same time and these two are so intertwined that we do not know which one is really the cause of the other and it does not matter what is abundantly clear is that we are colonized and exploited by white peopleall of them western christian racist and even the white worker a little pawn without imagination benefits from this thus class exploitation is not similar to racial domination and exploitation and marx developed theories and strategy to guide and attempt to humanize precapitalist europe but even he did not spend all his time theorizing his peoples problems he was not afraid he was out there organizing and mobilizing those forces to get the revolution off the ground where is our program of action the salvation of the world we now clearly know lies in the destruction of the power of the western world it lies in the establishment of a system of values hostile to any manner of exploitation oppression and the domination of one race by another race or one nation by another nation this calls for an understanding of the world we live in and a clear vision of the world we want to construct this calls for collective planning our lack of planning programs of action and establishing revolutionary social institutions renders us weak as a group and i say lumumba got killed because of our collective weakness mandela and sobukwe and thousands of others are in jails immobilized because of our collective weakness brother malcolm was assassinated at the beginning of his revolutionary maturity because of our collective weakness countless other perverted atrocities are continually perpetrated on us because of our collective weakness brothers what i am driving at is for instance the following if our historical enemynow practically our natural enemyhad known that should anything have happened to brother malcolm_x there would have been chaos in harlem that night that the following day there wouldnt have been a single whiteowned store on th street that the very foundations of this system would have had to cope with a black uncontrollable power the chances are that brother malcolm would still be with us i do not accuse the group of wanting to be ownedeven remotely psychologicallyby imperialist forces i believe that we would rather die than be weak and enslaved in whatever form modernday slavery is practiced i believe that we want to live in a world with a new order of things a new image of man loving love loving life feeling and really living instead of being perverted with material values i believe that we all no longer want any stupid iffy concessions from liberals who are essentially in sympathyand collaboratewith the forces we want to destroy for the survival of humanity we know the aspirations and the needs of the people because if we are not just maladjusted western artists with black faces mere carboncopy whitemen our consciousness and collective conscience find direction from the throbbing of the peoples collective heart of course the people are not always right hence the absolute necessity for institutions that would guide the development of their values if we have this consciousness and we are moved by our conscience as men in search of a new order of things we will realize that the frustrated opportunistic dishonest white lefts anticapitalist whimpering is not our problem i believe it is time for us to stop and check ourselves out thoroughly and as leroi jones said you might surprise yourself right out the window we are preoccupied if we are sincere not necessarily with the atrocities of the western world but with turning the world into a better place for human habitation we feel and think as we do only because we now believe that we are inherently more interested in humanity than in the material values of the white western world this does not mean that we have not killed men and raped women but our historical experience is such that since we came into contact with the white sensibility the concentration of our efforts our attempt as a race to live has boiled down to means of survival however right now we are not concerned with what we might have been but with what we will be we clearly understand that we are at war we have always been at waronly for so long we pretended that we did not clearly realize we were now we clearly realize also that whether we fight back or not the enemy continues to molest us there are some mature artists and intellectuals around unfortunately their growth is mainly personal virtually divorced from the masses of the people though forever given momentum by the peoples collective desire for liberation in this aspect of our development our acts the constant broadening of our consciousness of the world we live in our psychological liberation have been mainly personal because we have not developed a body of thought an ideology to determine our collective behavior a firm uncompromising stand as a liberatory vehicle the people must know what is going on and what can be done this means we should be prepared to analyze situations and help to clarify the peoples vision when johnson comes out and threatens remember theres only ten per cent of you we must clarify the implications of that move to the people a speech at a rally or an article in a magazine will not do this we have to establish institutions which will facilitate the political education of the people where our strategies can be mapped out and then there is the crucial question of symbols the symbols that the majority of the people relate to have been created by the oppressor to ensure our psychological captivity we must create more relevant symbols that the peoples development of a system bols that will intensify the peoples determination to be free politically economically and psychologically symbols that will facilitate the peoples development of a system of thought which will enable them to readily see through the oppressors strategies so that we will not be caught offguard again as it so damned frequently happens our awareness of where we are historically demands this responsibility of us finally i think our method at this historical moment as a group is bankrupt our literature and the arts i believe should be the solid coil around our collective desire and method make no mistake there is some beautiful poetry around some beautiful music and the rest of the arts too but the people do not know this the people do not read they are too busy at the grind trying to make it perhaps even if they read at this stage of our development they would not recognize the beauty because of the symbols they have been trained to relate to and poetry is not enough it is not and has never been because of a lack of poetry song or dance that we are in our present condition somewhere tucked away in the recesses of my being is a hazy e memory as time has passedi have occa sionally reflected on this reminiscence and wonder whether it is a dream or an altered childhood fanft tasy with all of us the passage of time makes dreams fantasy and reality blur and mix so that our memories are a coalescence of what was what we longed for and what we were afraid of i recall a time when i was approximately nine our minister announcing that at the end of the service the next week a mr rasmussen would have a few words to say ours was the colored methodist episcopal church in los angeles in later years to further an identity search and discard an outmoded image the church changed its name to christian methodist episcopal following the announcement by our pastor there was a general buzzing in the church i became aware that mr rasmussen was white and heard mutterings that it was election time in keeping with the practices then current he was expected to give an innocuous talk and the adults in the congregation were subsequently expected to go out and vote for him except in rare circumstances no one in the church would see him again until his next political campaign our visitor would stay for just a few minutes and then visit other branches of the church in south los angeles south los angeles was an euphumism for watts which even then was the last district on the agenda of any politician in those days and i imagine even now all the children sat in the balcony or loft of the church there we could sleep pass notes and from our lofty perch make judgments on the presumed sinners in the congregation below i still cringe as i recall the minister stopping in midsermon to admonish the children to be quiet for us the voice of god himself could not have been more frightening or commanding after the announcement of mr rasmussens forthcoming visit i vaguely hoped he would not come i was uncomfortable at the thought of his observing our congregation if our pastor was in good form there was a possibility that sister tyler would get happy or that someone might get carried away with amens sister tyler was our barometer indicating whether a sermon really swung or not on some sundays the large dark lady sang vigorous solos she was resplendent in her robe and her mobile face and body conveyed her mood as much as her voice she was able to control the congregation in accompanying any speaker often punctuating the preachers message with short replies if he began to really move she served as a catalyst for the entire congre gation to pour out their feelings and shout while we could get happy among ourselves i was uncomfortably aware even at that age that we could never let white people observe us carrying on the next week was one of tremendous excitement and anticipation for me several times i went to bed and drifted off to sleep only to be awakened by a nightmare in which sister tyler had indeed gotten happy jumped up and yelled and fallen prostrate to the floor as in the past the ushers came up with their fans and placed magic potions under her nose but this time the good sister continued her assault on the devil by jumping up and starting the whole sequence over again i could never reconcile the ambivalence of getting happy in church with being joyful in that there was always much crying handclapping and body writhing accompanying the former my mother once spent all of a summer talking me out of a youthful concept that when sister tyler got happy she was really quite angry the nightmares continued all week long until sunday arrived i could hardly wait for sunday school to end so the service could proceed we had the various offerings and songs followed by the sermon mr rasmussen was to appear at the end of the service our minister seemed particularly slow that day dragging the service on and on by the time mr rasmussen actually appeared my dreadful anticipations had left me so emotionally spent that i heard only a small part of his very brief speech he came in through a side door and immediately began to vigorously shake the hand of our pastor after the introduction he began to talk in a low voice and kept referring to himself as your friend occasionally his head would nod back and forth and i vividly recall seeing a single white face silhouetted in front of the choir while the details of that face have long since fled my memory many of the feelings experienced during that day have remained from a seat in the balcony i had gotten upstairs early to be assured of a front row i looked down at the congregation sister tyler was serene and relaxed with a masklike face influenced by her the other ladies were also sitting quietly the only overt signs of any feelings were occasional nods of the head more perfunctory and habitual than anything else i have often reflected on my week of painful expectation mr rasmussen came and spoke and left for watts i wondered what he did when he was not making speeches did he have any children did they go to church i felt he did not know us and we did not know him the minister had not sounded like himself when he introduced the guest no one had gotten happy all of us had held back and i perceived that mr rasmussen had also held back i wondered if he would make the same speech in watts and if he would know the people there any better or if they would know him something had been missing in us when mr rasmussen came and i felt sure something had been missing in him also we did not know ourselves in the presence of each other at first this realization was one of relief later it was pain i one of the most significant and disturbing problems of contemporary america is the continuing and as yet unsuccessful effort to delineate a national identity in our sloganeering culture this effort has been characterized as a quest for identity writers discussing this search have had many and at times conflicting views but the concept of identity itself has remained an important one identity now appears as a central idea among people of the modern world from peoples all over the globe the word is heard to describe the highest ambitions of men in some unifying manner the patriot in africa the slum dweller in rio de janeiro and many people in this country all appear to be making the same appeals new national entities such as kenya and established ones such as france all use the term to exhort their people to more eloquent heights erik erikson the foremost student of identity defines the term simply an identity provides the ability to experience oneself as something that has continuity and sameness and to act accordingly he was the first social scientist to relate man to an environment that was both internal and external only after the contributions of erikson did we begin to take into account how a mans caste and class influenced so totally his thoughts about himself a healthy identity encompasses basic thoughts that one has about his body and sex parental love and admonitions which have been effectively assimilated an important aspect of a viable identity is the capacity to perceive oneself as something having a past present and future in short a personal historical sense this is seldom conscious but more a subtle awareness that one has alternatives and can make choices the familiar adolescent crisis is our most visible example of an individual groping for identity as adolescents make the transition from dependence and reliance on others to independence and selfsufficiency there can be many outward evidences of change some of these are delicate and barely noticed and some are explosive and frenzied for an individual to achieve completeness and the ability to give and receive mature love then many basic questions surrounding identity must be resolved contrary to popular misconception these are rarely if ever accomplished by asking who am i outside the offices of psychiatrists or the imaginations of philosophers few people ask themselves this question they may unknowingly pursue an identity adopting or discarding several but the question is invariably asked inwardly the question manifests itself with patterns of thought or by feelings and behavior but seldom by open conscious questions another important consideration is that an individual is never without an identity it may be hated devalued and despised but it is present nevertheless in this context the negro in this country has always had an identity namely that of an anomalous black man in a white mans country one of his core problems remains the assimilation of his blackness into the white american identity he has been seen as a person of sorts but not as a whole man with a full range of choices of central importance here is the following concept where expression of ones identity has been denied one of the dangerous paths open is the seizure of identity through destructive action the article on a philip f ir randolph portrait of an afroamerican d radical by john henrik clarke ne gro digest march raises serious questions about the way our history is treated in the popular press although mr clarkes purpose in writing this piece was ostensibly to present a brief sketch of what went into the making of an afroamerican radical it so happens that radicals such as mr randolph do not make history solely according to the dictates of their own personal designs such leaders are also shaped molded and propelled by social forces outside of and beyond themselves hence it is impossible to get an understanding of a radical fortyodd years after his beginnings by telling only what he accomplished we have a right to also know some of his failures and at least a hint of what outside trends and forces during his career made for both his successes and his failures mr clarke failed to do this although he could very well have a philip randolph is one of the more outstanding leaders in the th century history of the american negro this is emphasized in order to separate the th from the th century this is done because the most serious weakness in the outlook of the negro civil_rights niques is blunted by racial realities in america the militants are in serious trouble they are forced to retrench behind slogans like black_power etc and to formulate new programs for action there is very little understanding here that as leaders and activists this new militant breed of the s is nothing but a conmovement in all its factions is that most of the new leaders and ideologists have very little understanding of the negro movements th century beginnings and the mixture of ingredients that went into those beginnings this ignorance of the th century is most glaring in the socalled militant nationalist black_power wing of the negro movement once the effectiveness of militant direct action tech tinuation or repetition of similar trends issues slogans and programs brought to life from to the s the very period which produced a man like a philip randolph our movements for freedom equality liberation emigration separation integration and even migration from one state to another section are th century movements they have only the most tenuous historical connections with th century trends of frederick douglass and others yet there is a persistent belief in articulate negro circles that our present day movements are traceable back to precivil war slavery emancipation reconstruction etc but this is true only in a historical romantic sense we honor a frederick douglass in this historical sense but all that douglass stood for and fought for in postcivil war reconstruction was washed away by southern bourbon restoration of the s and s douglass died in during the very decade when the united states became an openly aggres sively imperialist nation in its war against spain in cuba and the philippines when america became imperialistic in foreign policy the relationship of the negro to american society changed character and became something else not experienced by frederick douglass and the leaders of his heyday the negro was still committed to struggling for the same objectives as douglass had but under radically changed social economic political and cultural conditions it was for these reasons that the s and early s produced two entirely new leaders in the person of booker t washington and w e b du bois who came into mutual conflict over program in a way that douglass never had to experience with his own black contemporaries over slavery and emancipation thus the th century produced the movements the leaders the trends the ideas the conflicts which formed the historical and organizational beginnings to which our current movements are heirs from to we had washingtons tuskegee movement in we had du boiss niagara movement which helped establish the naacp in in the urban league was formed and a few years later began the greatest mass migration in american history of the negro out of the south into the north in the meantime the american socialist party had attracted a corps of negro intellectuals of whom a philip randolph was one of the most outstanding the messenger magazine which he edited along with chandler owen was a black socialist organ which grew out of the hotel messenger which randolph had founded in in the american communist movement was established following the russian revolution of as a result certain negro socialists associated with randolph on his messenger broke with the socialists to become communists randolph however remained a socialist and became an anticommunist thus there developed a bitter political feud between randolph and certain of his former socialist colleagues in the communist party which lasted from the s into the s and beyond a philip randolph emerged as a socialist leader just prior to the time marcus garvey established his nationalistic back to africa movement in harlem after having failed to set it up in jamaica british west indies there developed a bitter feud not only between randolphs messenger group and the garveyites but also a fight between the garveyites and the very same excolleagues of randolphs who had become communists there was also a violent polemical conflict between marcus garvey and du boiss naacp at the same time the young writers on randolphs messenger were criticizing w e b du bois as an old leader from the old school who no longer spoke for the new negro this was the same thing du bois had told booker t washington about years earlier when he revolted against booker ts conservative economic nationalism with the niagara movement what was going on here in the s negro movements it was a fateful clash between naacp civil_rightsism garvey nationalism negro socialism negro communism plus black trade unionism when randolph launched his brotherhood of sleeping car porters organizing drive in then to add to this wild conflict of black politics and economics came the provocative and as yet illunderstood question of cultural consciousness of the negro renaissance movement which produced langston hughes paul robeson claude mckay countee cullen etc and the jazz age the grass roots ferment underlying all of this provocative social ferment was the mass migration into new york of southern negroes and west indians the west indian character of the garvey movement spawned a clash between west indians and american negroes over group social values leadership priorities and accommodation to the ways of life in american northern cities the attacks on garveyism emanating from randolphs messenger and du boiss naacp took on an antiwest indian flavor and garvey saved his choicest blasts for du bois yet the facts are that behind the scenes garveys most effective enemies the ones who had him jailed were west indians all of these and more were the basic ingredients that went into the formation of the th century negro movement we know today and every single one of these issues are still with us only in a more complex and exaggerated form what we are dealing with in todays civil_rights movement are the unsolved problems not of the s but of the s it was against such a background that a philip randolph started the brotherhood of sleeping car porters but for mr clarke to merely cite the opposition of the pullman company against randolphs efforts is of little crucial importance today everybody knows that industry management was always antilabor whether white or black what is more important for us is an insight into randolphs personal socialist politics before he started organizing porters for example who were some of the other prominent negro socialists randolph was allied with why were they so critical of the politics of w e b du bois clarkes freedomways magazine is a very produ bois publication but in randolphs messenger said that du boiss conception of politics is strictly opportunist within the last six years he has been democrat socialist and republican he must said the messenger editorially make way for the new radicalism of the new negro during the same period several of randolphs socialist colleagues around the messenger broke with the socialist party and joined the newly formed communist party movement they became the pioneer negro communists of the s it is important for us to know why randolph refused to become a communist himseff while some of his friends did randolph always remained an anticommunist at least two of randolphs former s friends are still alive and one of them even writes for freedomways occasionally in view of the fact that w e b du bois finally joined the communist party in some years after it was formed and in view of the fact that freedomways is produ bois how can mr clarke as a freedomways editor call randolph a radical what was the precise difference between du boiss radicalism and randolphs radicalism the communists of the s looked with disfavor upon randolphs organizing of the pullman porters into a separate allblack union none of randolphs exnegro socialist friends who had become communists supported randolph in his efforts to organize the porters why did they take this attitude during the same periodrandolphs messenger said editorially that negro communists were a menace why did randolph believe this what about randolphs relationship with the garvey movement it is a fact that randolphs messenger writers were implacable enemies of the garvey movement in the messenger attacks on the garvey movement were so bitter that a w a domingo one of randolphs exfriends among the negro socialists wrote a letter of protest accusing the messenger of being antiwest indian domingo had quit the messenger as a staff writer because of randolphs handling of the garvey question domingo complained who are the bitterest enemies and most persistent opponents of garvey arent they west indians w a domingo was antigarvey randolph was antigarvey and the communists were antigarvey and garvey was particularly anticommunist but what was garveys attitude towards randolphs organizing of the pullman porters this question is no longer crucial for garveyism today since garveyism is no longer an important force however it is still important relative to the communists because the enmity between randolph and the communist party has been an everlasting fact mr clarke however must pass over many of these facts as if they were not important but they are not only must we review all these historical trendsgarvey nationalism black socialism black communism black trade unionism black civil_rightsism etcwe must also have some historical understanding of why all these factions were at each others political throats what were they really fighting over consider mr clarkes treatment of randolphs role in the organizing of the national negro congress clarke gives us a long quotation from randolphs speech at the founding convention of the nnc in which he optimistically accepted the presidency of the new organization but mr clarke has nothing to say about why randolph quit the nnc four years later he quit because the national negro congress very quickly came under the control of the communist party and randolph the radical did not go along with the communist takeover again randolph clashed with the communists as he had back in the s why this conflict according to one historian of this period randolph quit the national negro congress because the nnc was now nothing more than an enlarged communist party cell he knew that to continue in office would mean acceptance of a program which he could not endorse in principle he knew too that it would mean serving as a stooge for the party bureaucrats and their errand boy who now firmly held the reins of all the governing committees randolph stated his own reasons for quitting the presidency of the nnc in the new york times of april the national negro congress should be dependent on resources supplied by the negro people alone the grounds for my belief is that history shows that where you get your money you also get your ideas and control e franklin frazier writing of the national negro congress meeting of said the large attendance of whites in was the result it was reported of the influence of the communist party when one considers the diverse interests that were represented in the organizations officially affiliated with the national negro congress it is obvious that its unity and solidarity rested upon a precarious basis from the beginning these were some of the facts concerning randolph and the national negro congress thus for mr clarke to contend that the nnc was a forerunner of presentday civil_rights groups such as the congress of racial equality core and the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc is a gross distortion of historical fact core started in as an independent nonpolitical noncommunist affiliated civil_rights group while sncc started in the sixties as a studentyouth movement under youth leadership the nnc was certainly not a youth group how can a historian as experienced as clarke make such shallow and inaccurate comparisons the nnc was a product of the severe economic depression of the s plus the ciolabor organizing upsurge that distinguished this period it was a product of its times and had little in common with the issues of the s except civil_rights which has always been with us through the lean years and the fat lastly comes mr clarkes glowing account of randolphs role in organizing the famous move for his march on washington of the threat of this march caused president roosevelt to issue his renowned executive order establishing the presidents committee on fair employment practices committee fepc this order was effective in outlawing racial discrimination in war defense industries randolph then called off the intended march on the capital having achieved his aims but here again it is important to note that none other than the communist party randolphs antagonist since the s was in opposition to this march on washington in fact both the communist party and randolphs former organization the national negro congress were against randolphs march on washington movement the reasons for this opposition were too complicated to be analyzed here but they were based mainly on the communist partys enmity over randolphs undisputed influence in the negro community which the communists tried mightily to undermine the historian quoted earlier wrote some of the most vitriolic attacks ever leveled by the communist party at a negro organization were visited upon the march on washington during this period if it was mr clarkes intent to merely write a laudatory piece on a philip randolph as the dean of negro leaders that is his privilege yet clarke is a historian and more is demanded of a historian today mr clarke however succeeds in lifting randolph out of too much of the social context that is pertinent to our understanding of what made randolph what he is and was randolph as a leadership personality was molded by a great conflict of th centurytrends that emerged between and the s it was practically these trends which created the th century negro struggle in all its complexity the negro movement in all of its aspects we know today are nothing but a continuation of those early trends on another level anyone who does not understand these early trends cannot grasp what is wrong with the negro movement today the negro civil_rights movement is in a serious crisis now therefore it is necessary that the entire th century development of leadership trends must be researched analyzed and reevaluated from booker t washington to du bois to randolph to garvey to robeson to elijah muhammad down to malcolm_x and even adam clayton powell for without such a thorough going reevaluation and reinterpretation all such slogans as black_power remain empty talk this should be the objective of all history writing today especially about leaders oddly enough the editorial of mr clarkes freedomways magazine for fall supports the freedom budget another of randolphs achievements it says the freedom budget proposals have the support of all of the major organizations in the negro freedom movement although a philip randolph guided the preparation and publication of this budget freedomways does not mention him in the editorial we the members of the students afroamerip can society realize the need to comprehend more fully our perspective and our roles both as negroes and as members of the society in which we live we form this organization seeking to unite and utilize the resources and experiences of the students of columbia university in order that we may achieve a greater understanding of the complexity of racial problems in america thus states the preamble of the constitution of an organization which appears destined to play an important role in the future of the human rights struggle in the united states that organization is the students afroamerican society sas of columbia university this society of afroamerican students founded in by hilton clark son of the noted psychologist dr kenneth clark has one of the largest memberships of which are activeof several such societies which have sprung up on the ivy league campuses it is an example of a new much needed and muchwelcome trend of group identification which is developing among black students on prestigious ivy league campuses for many years and in most instances rightfully so black ivy leaguers have been accused of practicing a genteel uncle thomasism the chief purpose of which was to achieve individualistic material prosperity without a second thought to the wellbeing of their fellow afroamericans this tendency has severely hurt the overall progress of the human rights movement for it meant that afroamericans as a group were denied the benefit of skills that these highlytrained group members possessed with little if any group identification they felt no sense of group responsibility on december sas hosted the first intercollegiate conference of afroamerican students according to robert belt a senior government major at columbia college and current president of the columbia group the purpose of the conference was to examine the role afroamerican college students should play in the black revolution and their responsibility both individually and collectively to the civil_rights effort also according to mr belt the conference hoped to encourage the formation of afroamerican student societies at other universities and colleges and to lay the groundwork for the eventual federation of these groups into a nationwide association of afroamerican students among the schools represented at the conference were harvard yale princeton mt holyoke radcliffe barnard and vassar delegates also came from howard university and morehouse college speakers at the conference included james farmer former national director of the congress of racial equality core ivanhoe donaldson of the students nonviolent coordinating committee sncc roy innis president of harlem core floyd mckissick current president of national core and james meredith when asked by this writer to give their opinion as to the chief significance of the conference farmer replied that the chief significance is that at long last black students have overcome their fear of associating with other black students the students gathered here are wrestling with the major debates of the civil_rights movement and we need their minds in those debates innis said it gives me a chance to meet a good crosssection of the young black students and to sample their thinking this group is extremely important because like it or not they are future leaders and it is my job to try to influence them as much as possible in the interests of black people we have to compete with the enemy for their allegiance mckissick felt that it had brought afroamerican students together from all over the east this will benefit the cause of black_power and should hasten the end of uncle thomasism to meredith the very occurrence of the conference was the chief significance most meetings of black students have been for purely social purposes and the fact that they have met together for such serious purposes is the utmost importance donaldson of sncc told the students that it was important that they use the knowledge and skills gained in the prestigious universities not just for narrow individual attainment but as a means to help improve the nationwide and worldwide position of their group mckissick innis and donaldson also warned the students to beware of greeks bearing gifts they told them that the white power structure would expect payment for the honors scholarships and awards currently being bestowed upon them the payment of acting as a somewhat privileged buffer group between the white majority and the black masses the chief protection for the students against these notsosubtle attempts at seduction is a strong sense of group identification which will insure group loyalty the involvement of afroamerican student societies such as sas in the human rights movement indicates a new awareness among black students an awareness which should be supported by all elements of the black community the skills they are acquiring if put to the use of the total group can change the course of the movement and help to speed up the groups progress towards liberation afroamerican experts in such fields as history economics sociology journalism social science and politics should volunteer their services to the students the student movement if successful could eventually lead to an effective alliance between black students and the black masses such an alliance are dreams made of i was stationed in nigeria for the us information agency during eight of frdjrilkragj jts seventeen officers in the country were american negroes the spring of that year and the advent of birmingham presented the american negro officers with a particularly difficult informationpersuasion problem several who became especially adept in parring nigerian questions about us race relations frequently resorted to the expression its bad yes but lets put it in perspective then followed a carefully contrived monologue that left the nigerian feeling that in essence what was happening in birmingham was a good thing painful evidence that a basic change is being wrought etc at no time during nigerias current crisis have i had the opportunity to ask a us based nigerian information officer whats going on over there whats the trouble all about but if i did ask one and he were a good information officer hed probably tell me precisely what we told him its bad yes but lets put it in perspective he may or may not convince me that what appears to be nigerian chaos is really a good thing but the arguments he could marshal deserve far more consideration than they are getting in the current unbalanced reporting of these events what is happening in nigeria is bad but lets put it in perspective to accept the current press view that nigeria the most stable and most democratic black african republic is coming apart is to betray ones lack of information regarding what the real precoup nigeria was like for one thing it was never really stable or united if we mean by that a relatively permanent sovereign systemit was a subsystem of the british colonial em pire and in spite of a series of constitutional conventions sponsored by the british in preparing nigeria for independence little effective preparation took place instead the british left the country firmly in the hands of its favored tribe hausanortherners via a suspicious head count census that turned out to be the seed of the troubles currently reaped hence precoup nigeria never successfully solved the riddle that baffles newly sovereign states the problem of powerwho shall rule in accord with what authority this problem was particularly crucial for nigeria because this was not a country of disorganized tribal groupings but a combination of several peoples who as basil davidson put it had every right to consider themselves nations even within the narrowest meaning of the term he later remarks that it is extraordinary after all that nigeria should exist at all this was indeed extraordinary because the differences that existed and still exist between nigerias big three nonnations yorubaland iboland hausaland include differences in language religion in the ways communities are organized and ruled and basic differences toward the nature of life itselftheir only significant common heritage was british colonialism and that even differed between northern and southern nigeria the hard truth is that the multitribal multinational combination called nigeria was never the united sovereignty we came to hail in our press but rather a trial marriage in which the issue of who should be boss was never really settled in retrospect the myth of one nigeria was perhaps as much the creature of nonnigerians as nigerians and one of the side tragedies surrounding this myth was that we the west needed and wanted a united nigeria more than the nigerians so what relevance does this have for what we are seeing in nigeria it means that what we are witnessing is not the disintegration of in the us than to the failure of a colonial effort to make it so this event is less akin to the civil war in the u s than to the failure of the league of nations if we concerned ourselves less with predictions of doom for the rest of africa and more with an analysis of why this is happening we may well learn a few things as important to africaafterthenigeriancrisis as was the myth of one nigeria to the africa before the crisis the most potent lesson to be learned is that most of black africas nations created by the arbitrary groupings of former colonial simply may not survive under the circumstances it may be better to let them come apart and regroup along lines of their own choosing forming new nations with more workable economic and cultural eombinationsand certainly with more harmonious tribal groupings this possibility of complete disintegration followed by a more meaningful reintegration is a bitter pill for most africans and their wellwishers to swallow facing the first part of the proposition disintegration would be less painful however if they had more confidence in the ability of the africans to pull off the second part reintegration i am one of those who is confident that they can all the africans talk about african personality and african unity simply has to mean something and it could mean much more in more meaningful african states whats happening over there is bad yes but lets see it in this perspective during world war ii the nd infantry di vision left its heado quarters in the arizo w m na desert and crossed the atlantic to italy to engage the nazi and fascist enemy in the mountains of tuscany and in the valley of the po trudging to the front and in the cities that served as leave centers between battles the black soldiers of the nd division took up fists and guns against still another enemythe white fellowsoldier from back home across the nation now veterans of vietnam are returning home to take up their lives after having foughtstill one more timefor the preservation of democracy and the black veterans among them face as did their fathers after world war ii and their grandfathers after world war i the same denial of their rights of citizenship they have put their lives on the line for an idea which for them remains a promise such is an old american custom as old as the republic itself for crispus attucks the bold black man who was the first rebel to give his life in the revolt against the british would have fared no better than his heirs had he lived to enjoy the fruits of his heroism partly because black men have been refused their due as citizens and as warriors history has not underscored their roles and their heroism but there are movements afoot now to put history in perspective and a number of books are being published which unearth facts of the black mans contribution to the story of america which historians once very carefully buried one such book is the buffalo soldiers a narrative of the negro cavalry in the west written by william leckie and published during last spring by the university of oklahoma press the author is dean of the graduate school of the university of toledo ohio and author of another book on the west also published by the university of oklahoma press the military conquest of the southern plains the buffalo soldiers is a carefully researched report on the black men who were recruited for the ninth and tenth regiments of the united states army following the civil war they were taken into the army primarily to use in controlling and pacifying the indians whose lands the government had seized there were no experienced negro officers and the congress provided that all the officers were to be white mr leckie says and he indicates that the officers selected to head the two regiments of cavalry were capable and compassionate men considering the circumstances the commander of the ninth cavalry was edward hatch a blond blueeyed native of maine and a veteran of the civil war who had ended his duty there as a brevet major general of volunteers the commander of the tenth cavalry was benjamin grierson a scarredface former music teacher who had contributed materially to grants successful operations around vicksburg the order to form the two regiments was sent out by general ulysses s grant in august and colonel hatch established headquarters in greenville la while colonel grierson set up headquarters at fort leavenworth kansas there were the usual arguments about the impossibility of black men becoming good soldiers and the recruiters who fanned out over the east and south to enlist recruits made little effort to select ablebodied men the pay was a month plusof coursefood clothing and shelter which seemed a very good proposition indeed to many freedmen despite the fact many of them were too light too young and had weak constitutions also white officers were extremely reluctant to join units made up of black recruits and the securing of a necessary complement of officers delayed formation of the calvary unitsmr leckie sheds an amusing sidelight on one of the officers who refused to command black troops the dashing boy general george a custer refused a lieutenant colonelcy with the ninth and wrangled the same rank in the newly formed seventh calvarya decision that was probably a stroke of good fortune for the ninth and launched custer on the road to the little big horn and a dubious niche in history years later in the training camps the black soldiers were quartered in the least desirable areas causing many to become ill they were not permitted to march in review along with white troops on the post and they were the victims of general discrimination at fort leavenworth colonel grierson complained against such treatment and against the fact that the horses supplied to the troops were for the most part old and cripple by august eight companies of the tenth calvary were in the field three in indian territory and the others stationed at posts and camps along the kansas pacific railroad then under construction soon afterwards colonel grierson transferred his headquarters to fort riley kansas where the organization of the other four companies of the regiment was completed for more than two decades following the ninth and tenth cavalries served the nation on the great plains and in the mountains and deserts of arizona and new mexico during the first decade the black troops were pitted constantly against the nomad indiansthe comanches the kiowas the kiowaapaches the southern cheyennes and the araphoes the troops won the indians were forced back into reservations it required at least another five years for the black troops to defeat and pacify the indians along the rio grande frontier with mexico and during this time the buffalo soldiers also fought the apaches of new mexico and arizona in mountain nests and on waterless desolate desert wastes writes mr leckie the duties of the regiments would not be limited to fighting indians law and order were little more than a hope in the postcivil war southwest and civil authorities were compelled constantly to call upon the army to assist in rounding up border scum the region swarmed with cattle thieves as well as men who killed with little or no provocation petty scheming and sometimes murderous politicians combined with greedy land and cattle barons crooked government contractors heartless indian agents and landhungry homesteaders were the source of civil broils of a scope far beyond control of local or state authority the result was inevitable involvement in civil affairs for the ninth and tenth with little hope or expectation of gratitude regardless of outcome or contributionthe two regiments moved west right into the middle of an indian war of almost unprecedented scope and violence the indians had brought the building of the railroad to a virtual standstill and were chasing away settlers scalping traders and scattering cattle the troops moved in to protect railroad workers and stations escort stage coaches and trains and generally scouting the area even an outbreak of cholera among the men which killed a number of them did not relieve them of the heavy responsibility to guard the encroaching forces of civilization battle experience and responsibility mellowed the black recruits and turned them into efficient soldiers mr leckie reports the indians gained a great respect for them as fighting men and it was the indians who gave the troops the name buffalo soldiers many of the individual tales of extraordinary heroism and valor exhibited by the black troops are recounted in the book as well as the facts of the governments lack of consideration of them and the tendency to overwork them an example the buffalo soldiers hardly had time to cool their saddles detachments were necessary for constant escort to stages and trains to protect workers at the end of track and to scout along the smoky hill saline and solomon rivers in august alone the overworked troopers scouted more than miles searching for the flitting red raiders september was more of the same until the middle of the month then captain g w graham with men of i company struck and followed a trail along the denver road until they reached big sandy creek here cheyennes were waiting and engaged them in a bitter fight at close quarters the men of i in their first encounter and outnumbered badly fought like cornered wildcats when the engagement ended at nightfall cheyennes were dead and wounded graham reported his loss as one man wounded and horses either killed or missing the book throws significant light on the career and fate of lt henry flipper the first and only negro officer in the tenth regiment a hero on the front lt flipper later faced disgrace because of the jealousv of his fellow officers all of whom were white the summer of found lieutenant flipper in major trouble the only negro officer in the united states army flipper had been assigned to nolans a company he was well received by officers and men and proved an excellent soldier his services in the victorio war had won plaudits from both nolan and grierson and a bright career seemed assured clouds appeared on the horizon when a company came in to fort concho flipper found a riding companion in one of the few eligible young ladies at the post and his attentions aroused the resentment of some of his fellow officers one of the officers who resented lt flipper was a lt charles nordstrom who previously had enjoyed the ladys favors the upshot of the antagonism was that lt flipper named post commissary was arrested for embezzling and confined to the post guardhouse the black officer was later cleared of embezzlement charges but nevertheless convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer and booted out of the cavalry to the end of his days flipper maintained that he was the victim of a plot hatched by colonel shafter lt nordstrom and lt louis wilhelm by the tenth was no longer needed on the texas frontier settlement law and order which the regiment had done so much to further had arrived the sioux troubles of and the fight at drexel mission capped the long career of the ninth cavcontinued from page airy on the frontier this performance was in keeping with the record of the regiment since its departure from san antonio years before four companies marched an incredible miles under blizzard conditions fought two engagements and saved a command twice their strength from grievous loss they received little official recognition alas that is a familiar story it was true of the original buffalo soldiers and true of those who followedunder the buffalo bannerthree quarters of a century later in the mountains of italy and no doubt it will be true of all those black young men now fighting the nations war in southeast asia the buffalo soldiers were brave and valiant men and though there is little reason to be happy that they helped to destroy the indian tribes who were the original settlers of this land it is more than a little appropriate that their role in the development of the west be toldat lastin detail and with fairness it was not until rash man x the little black muslim began talking to us my friend teddy crawford and me that i began to notice for him the teasing seemed all for fun but i was living through a very serious vulnerable summer so there was something deeper than fun in it for me rashman was a small man four inches shorter than i and though i was skinny then rashman was skinnier he was a neat taut man with skin the color of pitch his neatness and his dignity prevented his looking scrawny even with his knees and elbows coming to points as they did when he bent them beneath his starched white barbers uniform his hair was peppergray and always neat and parted and i never saw him once when he needed a shave that saturday morning when teddy crawford and i entered his barbershop the bums off ninth street followed us bringing with them their usual odor of tobacco filth and wine to mix with the odor of talc and aftershave lotion in side they took seats along the wall to wait for the teasing that always followed when rashman and i got together rashmans wit was as sharp as the razor he shaved himself with and i was foolish enough to challenge him he had a clever way making small things seem significant thus leaving them no longer small for example that saturday while i was in the chair he brought to my attention that all the women in my fathers churchs woman society for christian service were even as dark as teddy crawford and i and we were only medium brown yes and i remember how rashman had stopped me when i said only medium brown thus succeeding cleverly at making the bums think that i had said that we had fallen away from grace by only that much that at least we were not black i didnt say that i challenged quickly but rashman was already laughing what i called then his little wickerwire laugh way back in the roof of his mouth he cut me off so i would not have a chance to explain myself dont let folks brain wash you son he said whenever we faced off like this and he scored first he always spoke rapidly so i would not be able to score back i guess the christians taught you that black is the color of evil he laughed deliciously be careful son be careful then of course brain washing is seldom very painful and if its done subtly you never know its happened i knew a fellow once who went his entire life brain washed died happy though he winked at the bums and bent over to pump my chair up a little higher the bums smiled a few of them cleared their throats and there i was defenseless sitting in the middle of the shop with the silly barbers cloth tied around my neck wait youre trying to make these gentlemen think that i no im not criticizing you nooo i dont blame you one little bit its very hard to stand against an entire christian civilization its no fun having to make up everything from scratch better a servant in the house of the lord than a king among the unholy huh is that the way the bible says it he laughed again i dont blame you one iota why why enter the woods if you are not sure you can find your way out the bums laughed partly at me and partly with me we all have to enter the woods sometime i said oh sure yes yes its not bad to come in just dont come too deep come in look around then scat back he spun my chair you jump to conclusions too fast i said but this was not one of my good answers it did not get a rise out of the bums as some of my cracks used to doyes i do i do i shouldnt blame you for give me a chance to talk oh yes alright i got down out of the chair talking trying to hit on something that would swing the bums to my side but rashman had me too far down he could afford to smile complacently while i argued someone else got in the chair and he began pumping the chair up again after much grumbling from teddy crawford we left but only after i declared that i would be back as soon as i got myself together he sent me out onto the sidewalk with laughter and catcalls following me i laughed myself i liked rashman and i knew that he and the bums liked me but the only bad thing was he had been defeating me too soundly and too often ever since back in may when too much seriousness began to creep into my mood rashmans barber shop was the cleanest business on ninth street however my father warned me many times not to go there and listen to rashmans bile but teddy crawford and i with our money in our pockets would go down to ninth street on saturday morning and wander around until i could talk teddy into going to rashmans shop instead of to one of the others i always had to promise him that afterwards i would go with him up to maxine greens apartment over the tom thumb tailor shop maxines mother was never home on saturday mornings so i kept maxines three younger brothers outside while teddy slipped the meat to her in the bedroom okay teddy said on the first saturday in july only one week after he had promised never to go with me again ill go if you promise not to waste all day arguing with that nut okay to hell with rashman i said as we were coming down from teddys house toward the upper end of ninth street now youre talking baby teddy said walking widelegged filling his lungs with air obviously thinking about maxine green hey looka here rashman said as i pushed his front door open my little friends from the hill have come back the heavy glass door sucked close behind us i thought i scared you children away last time making light of your lord and saviour jesus christ like i did he spoke loud enough for everyone in the shop to hear at least ten men had followed us in two of them had to stand because there were not enough seats teddy and i took our seats along the wall under the row of gleaming mirrors to wait our turns in the chairs rashmans assistant a leanquiet boy who came in from st louis each weekend to work at rashmans mosque barber shop always cut teddys hair he liked to cut close and that was the way teddys mother liked it rashman did not say anything more to me until i got in the chair this was a tactic of his then how are things up home he said as i sat down did you tell the reverend what i said last week yeah i lied he said one of these days a bolt of lightnings going to hit your vilifying soul shaderow who had just sat down in the seat i had vacated laughed and repronounced my word rashman laughed and shook out the large pinstriped cover cloth he waved it in front of me like a magician teddy got into the chair next to mine the two men who had been playing checkers back near the shoeshine stand turned around to watch the bums seemed out of place with their tattered clothing and dirty bodies in the gleaming tile glass and porcelain shop the bright july sunlight passing thru the large clean front windows highlighted their filth it showed clearly the spittle in the mouth of one toothless one who was smiling as rashman spun me around rashman began by combing my hair briskly it was kinky because with all the reading i was doing i did not have time to care for it he made it pop and made the dust fly to put me further at a disadvantage by now all the bums were smiling waiting for the argument between me and rashman x the only negro in town who had courage enough to turn his back completely on christianity what words of wisdom do you have for us today my young man rashman asked none i answered and looked over at teddy crawford still believe in the saving grace of jesus christ he asked biblically knowing that i was going to say yes doesnt it frighten you being in here where lightning might strike then no how about you young man rashman asked spinning teddys chair so abruptly that the other barber had to jerk his clippers back teddy smiled fawningly his oily peanutsmooth complexion reddened his fat slick cheeks and round slick head seemed to fill up with blood no sir rashman let him go teddy was not the one he wanted he wanted me i was the outspoken one besides i had secretly been considering following my father into the christian ministry i suspected that rashman knew this and this was why he taunted me more than teddy we argued but everytime i was about to make a good point rashman would spin me away from my audience i would be facing myself selfconsciously in the mirror behind the chair the image of the row of bums bouncing back and forth between the mirrors on the opposite walls then rashman would pop my hair and the bums would roar i stood up when he was done and let him brush the hair off my green and yellow polo shirt teddy was finished long before i was he was in a hurry to get up to maxines christianity is dead thats a fact and it makes you a necrophiliac rashman sang the bums broke up over this word they smacked their thighs and laughed amen yea tell it like it is i waved rashman away as i followed teddy toward the door i had to laugh too when shaderow almost choked trying to repronounce necrophiliac but my laughter was not deep too much of what rashman said was too important the next sunday was a bright hot day i got up early let the sun into my room dressed carelessly and went outside thinking about rashman i wanted to skip church but i knew that i would not be able to tell my father why i walked around for a long time trying to decide what to do our church was the largest negro methodist church in the district and there were only three or four white churches largerall of them city churches up in st louis it was a natural stone building like the parsonage in which we lived they both sat on a grassy plot a block and a half from the negro college the neighborhood was not at all like you would picture a negro ghetto the houses and lawns were all wellcared for most of the houses were brick or stone and the few of them that were woodframe were in good repair the vacant lots around the campus and the church were all well cared for the streets were all paved sidewalks ran on both sides all the way up from ninth street back past carson avenue and laterally on all sides from bullock to canterberry except for the two blocks where the wall and the iron fence of the community cemetery precluded sidewalks nearly everyone in the entire neighborhood was a member of my fathers church most of them were teachers at hl single high school or over at the college ours was a world of secure jobs and easy living the bigotry and injustice which menaced the lives of so many black people during these years was closed out of it i walked down toward mason street thinking about that when i got down almost to where teddy crawford lived younger children started to come out of the houses dressed for sunday school i thought it best that beat it back and get ready to teach my sunday school class all during the hour i was hot with anxiety in the airconditioned building the lesson was about david the shepherd what i wondered did that have to do with anything obviously rashman had a way of getting weekly bulletins from the church for just as he said this was installation sunday for the new officers of the womans society for christian service i watched them as they filed past me toward the front of the church ah and you watch them rashman had said everyone of them past the age thirty has to wear glasses because their eyes are weak mongrelizations done it and you watch every one of them will be fat from over indulgence and lack of discipline on sunday as i watched the women i hated their stuffy sanctimonious smiles all of them were lightskinned plump and slightly bent all except two wore glasses i wondered if this was just a coincidence that rashman had noticed and decided to use against me or whether however silly scientifically it might seem his statement about mongrelization had some truth to it i thought for a moment then i shook my head no i could picture him behind his chair his image in the mirror showing his scissors poised above my unkempt hair his face caught for one static moment between smiles his own eyes aided by thin rimless glasses as i sat there in church i thought that i could hear his brief wickerwire laughter old mrs turner my high school civics teacher was standing two down from the end she had been called forward as the new recording secretary i focused my attention on her she used to call me her little preacher i shook with fear at the prospect that rashman might find out and tell it in the crowded barber shop as i looked at mrs turner i filled up with anger because even now i was arguing with rashman and losing mrs turner was too much for me to explain to someone like the bums rashman would get the better of me mrs turner was a big buttercolored woman who wore heavy coke bottlebottom glasses she hated her job and she hated the kids she had to teach all she taught for was the money in it that was plain from the way she acted i knew how much rashman would make of the contempt she had for the poorer kids from over in chambers who came to school poorly dressed and often a little dirty these kids were either timid and backwards or too manish or womanish for their ages to suit mrs turner the one group she ignored as often as she could and the others she expelled whenever she could get away with it i knew how rashman would tease me about the way mrs turner complimented me for not being like them her little preacher i shook my head again she did have the biggest tits on the faculty i could score with the bums by mentioning that and by adding that i was sure they didnt grow because of heavy sexual activity she must play with them every night and boy you ought to see them big yellow thighs when she sits up in the window sill at school i would say to make the bums laugh id sure like to get some of that stuff they would break up over thatlittle skinny me and big mrs turner still i would lose the argument with rashman because he knew me too well to be sidetracked but i was beginning to know rashman too he was wrong his science was screwed up shaderow and the others knew he was wrong too they were christians i had heard how groups of them would get juiced up on saturday night and pile into filberts car and go over to elder nashs church and sing and cry about whatever they had losta mother or father or something but rashman was right about them in a way christianity would never do more for them than make they feel a little better for a little while like a piece of blues for a month i did not go back to see rashman i was not ready to face him he was wrong but i did not know how to convince him his house sat across a vacant lot from his shop it was one of only three or four neat houses amid the squalor that was ninth street the house seemed very small sitting by itself behind a very straight wire fence unlike most of the houses around it it was freshly painted and all the boards were in place the house sat on piles and back under it the dirt was raked as level as concrete usually after eight oclock in the evening the windows in his house would darken i would see them as i passed taking nancy adkins home to chambers as far as i knew the lean boy from st louis was the only nonrelative who had ever entered rashmans house shaderow and filbert never had even the insurance man left him alone often i wanted to stop by nancy would say that it was all right with her but i was always a little too afraid i knew that rashman would be different without the bums to show off fordifferent and deeper often as i passed the house i would comment on how lonely it must get for rashman in there because at heart he was a talker the windows in the little old house would seem like halfclosed darkened eyes looking out on this dumping ground of christian civilization i went for six weeks without seeing rashman when my mother made what seemed her final threat i went to mr granisons barber shop to get my hair cut but the sunday after father let the man from the state fish and game board mealymouth the morning service i decided to go down to see rashman i was met at the door by his wife she was a small black woman who looked or years older than rashman my husband is not home she said but do come in she did not wait to see if i was going to follow but simply turned and walked ahead of me down the hallway into the living room the house had a stale odor inside like the odor inside the houses of very old people no sunlight came through the windows which were heavily draped the living room that we entered was small the heavy oldfashioned chair and sofa were covered with matching faded flowery slipcovers the rug was of a hard weave on the wall was a picture of rashman receiving his diploma from a high school in st louis this made me wonder how old rashman really was he had many gray hairs but his skin was very smooth he could be any age i examined the picture for a date but found none when i turned away from the wall mrs x motioned for me to sit in the chair under the picture she sat on the sofa across the room rashman has gone to st louis now for a little while she said he was very discontented here he told me a lot about you said you were the smartest youngster he had seen in a while not really i said and waved her comment away she looked at me and smiled he said when you get out of college you will be a great asset to the race the masses of our people need so much it always must be hoped that your generation will do much better than ours she examined me again with that curious look of hers two barefooted baldheaded boys of about four or five ran to the living room door and peeped in she laughed and called them forward pharoah and benda this is mr billy aaron she pushed them forward to meet me the bigger one took his fingers out of his mouth and gave me his wet hand to shake i was glad for their presence because i felt that their mother was very sad about something and i was not sure that i would know how to respond to it if she would decide to tell me what it was i took the smaller boy and tossed him toward the ceiling the bigger one pushed into my arms for some of the same treatment while i was engaged with them their mother slipped out of the room and brought back a glass of iced tea the two boys sat on my knees while i drank then i heard their sister come downstairs i knew that it was shera because i remembered that she was a very slow walker at home she was a much more imposing girl than at school she wore no makeup and her hair had been cut very short and had not been hot combed in a long time how was church this morning she asked she did not call me billy as she did at school but mr aaron as her mother called me when she asked shera you do know mr aaron do you not yes mother mr aaron is the best athlete in the tenth grade well her mother said rather sagelike rashman told me that how was church shera asked and smiled good i said and shrugged she must have known about the man from the fish and game board i did not know if she were going to tell rashman i did not know if i really cared we were christians once even shera was mrs x said we were church of god in christ she waited for a moment she seemed happy remembering you dont sing spirituals in your church do you no we sing anthems chorals neither word sounded right so i tried again you know hymns yes she said chorals are nice i knew she was saying this to make me feel good she looked like the kind who had loved spirituals in that other life of hers i talked for a long time with shera and mrs x about my plans to go to college and someday to be a writer as i talked i kept thinking yes education i must get that i cannot allow this disenchantment in me to drive me to the same conclusions that rashmans had driven him for i was sure now that his wife had with sadness let him go away to do whatever his restlessness was forcing him to do i was sure that when he left home he did not know himself exactly what that was in st louis the black muslims had started to make stands against the police i hoped very hard that this would not lead to violence in his absence i felt closer to rashman than i ever had i was afraid for him i was afraid that he had gone away to do what he said to make a stand against an entire civilization i wished that he had not gone i wanted to argue with him again i wanted to convince him that what he felt he had to do was not necessary but i was sure that if i had been given the chance to talk to him again i would not have known what to say the second annual fisk university writers conference settled into the comfort of an established institution during the threeday session april the fireworks of the student rebellion earlier in the month echoed on the campus and in the city of nashville but the conference proceeded in an atmosphere of calm and congeniality the conference theme was the black writer and human rights and novelist john o killens who as writerinresidence and head of the campus writers workshop had organized the conference invited seven writers to participate in panels devoted to a consideration of human rights as relates to the writers particular literary disciplines the writers were novelists ronald fair and mr killens nonfiction authors lerone bennett jr and john henrik clarke poets gwendolyn brooks and margaret danner and playwrights leroi jones and ronald milner mr killens was assisted by workshop students bessie frazier lonnetta gaines donald graham phyllis griffith harold lazard and kathryn mickens four of whom introduced the visiting authors to the audiences in the appleton room of historic jubilee hall the turn out for all the panel discussions was large and enthusiastic and the final sessions drew a crowd which left even standing room at a premium the attraction understandably was leroi jones the poetplaywright delivered a meaty and provocative speech and then ignited the student audience with a thoroughly effective theatrical reading of a group of his poems the conference proceedings were marked by a notable lack of controversy probably because those who might have disagreed with the panelists declined to appear or if they were present in the audience they remained silent from all indications also few members of the faculty were in attendance with one or two exceptions the visiting writers were not received by faculty members and those faculty members who made the effort to greet the writers were not from the english department on a singularly unfortunate occasion two panelists were forced to answer one of the young workshop hosts who implied impertinently that older black poets had not been paying their dues the student might have saved himself considerable embarrassment by reading in advance some of the work of the poets who shared the platform with him lerone bennett jr who is senior editor of ebony magazine as well as author of four published books and a fifth to be published this summer was asked to explain how he a blackoriented writer justified his association with a magazine which appeared to disdain blackness in its advertisements and in some features and to idealize white middleclass values in its features the author who is frequently confronted with such questions made no effort to justify the magazines editorial policies and directions however he did point to the magazines contributions in the area of negro history and black consciousness and sought without much success to explain the hard facts of economics which influenced the magazines publisher in catering to what is demonstrably the general public preference the growth of black consciousness on the fisk campus was evident it is not possible to gauge novelist john o killens direct influence on this phenomenon but the writers relaxed informal manner and his total lack of pomp and pretention cannot but have proved a remarkable change for a faculty member on the campus the thrust of his relationship with the student has been to narrow the distance between teacher and student rather than to expand it during the final session of the fisk conference those in attendance drafted and approved a statement in support of dr martin_luther_king jr and his stand relative to the war in vietnam the statement which had the prior approval of writerpanelists who had departed for home lerone bennett jr ronald fair read as follows we support dr martin l kings stand in his opposition to the war in vietnam for many diverse personal reasons but most especially because dr_king has been consistent in his desire for nonviolence both within american borders and by america herself abroad we find it difficult to understand why a man hailed for his stand on nonviolence and a recipient of the nobel peace prize should now be castigated because he refuses to mount the white charger to lead brave young men into armed battle dr_king has never stood for armed battle and we can find no overwhelming reason for him to send young men to kill now he has stood ready to give his life in love for peace not in malice for war and for this we commend him those endorsing the statement included john o killens john henrik clarke leroi jones ronald milner the week following the writers conference ushered in the th annual festival of music and art on campus during which at least three other noted writers appeared before the students paule marshall novelist and short story writer spoke on legacy in black robert hayden poet and fisk teacher read from his recently published book selected poems and robert e lee coauthor of the comedy auntie mame addressed the assembly other highlights of the festival included an exhibition of sculptures by john w rhoden and paintings by walter williams a concert by miriam makeba a concert by the fisk jubilee singers and a dance recital under the direction of mrs mabel r love choreographer should the new african nations try first to organize their own human resources and concentrate on building viable economic institutions at home or should they seek to develop into modern nations through allout policies of economic interdependency with the great industrial countries of the west this was one of the questions posed during a conversation with africa seminar sponsored by the phelpsstokes fund may at holly knoll the robert r moton conference center at capahosic virginia during the seminar an american employee of a federal agency advanced the suggestion that emergent africas best bet for development lay in economic interdependency with the industrial giants the american was forcefully challenged by the ambassador of an east african nation who described the true nature of economic interdependency between africa and the west as one of western rapacity of african natural resources the ambassador agreed that africa needs the technology and capital of the west but he declared thatfor his country at any ratethat technology and capital was welcome only if it came to africa on africas terms during the threeday seminar some africans and afroamericans spoke with eloquence candor and occasionally much heat on such general topics as the nature of africanamerican relations the role of afroamerican colleges can play in the advancement of africa the urgent need for the intellectual emancipation of all black people the mutual problems and destiny of black people on the two continents and the need for afroamericans to rally to the support of freedom movements in those areas of africa still under european domination capahosic is not much of a town and the casual motorist is likely to drive past it without being aware of holly knoll or of the existence and purpose of the conference center however the group of black people of remarkably varied career backgrounds and philosophical outlook who travelled to the idyllic little retreat on the banks of the york river had the best of motives for seeking it out they came for a serious dialogue on the problems facing black people everywhere most of them believing that the genuine freedom of black people in any land is compromised so long as black people in any other land remain unfree it was the second such seminar organized by the phelpsstokes fund and possibly because of the previous experience all went like clockwork a few of the guests arrived by automobile driving in from washington points in virginia and even from new york city but most arrivals were met at the airport in richmond and chauffeured out to capahosic through verdant and peaceful country holly knoll which is growing in importance as a conference center is equipped to accommodate up to people comfortably the spacious manor house has more than a dozen bedrooms as well as a dining room and salons there is a motel with some six apartments and a rustic log cabin with three bedrooms for relaxation there is a game room which adjoins the conference room tennis courts a swimming pool and a pier jutting out into the river which makes boating fishing or even swimming possible holly knoll was established by the robert r moton memorial foundation in honor of the former president of tuskegee institute and it is supported by gifts and guided by the phelpsstokes fund whose president is dr frederick d patterson himself a former president of tuskegee the retreat has played host to small groups concerned with dialogueparticularly on matters regarding race relationsfor a decade this years conversation with africa seminar attracted a remarkably diverse group of conversants a reflection of the acumen of the director robert s browne the africans in attendance were ambassador and mrs michael lukumbuzya of tanzania mr cofer of nigeria chauncey cooper of liberia elio samba second counsellor of the embassy of the democratic republic of the congo kinshasa david wakati information counsellor of the embassy of tanzania mrs regina dickson wife of the second secretary of the embassy of ghana and paul touba and emmanuel fernandes two student refugees from angola the afroamericans present were keith baird a new york city educator and contributing editor of freedomways denis baron

chicago illinois miss alberta culbreath a designer dr robert p daniel president of virginia state college miss mary kennedy of the afroangloamerican program at teachers college columbia university miss shelby lewis of the council of the africanamerican institute dr richard a long a professor at hampton institute and lincoln o lynch associate national director of the congress of racial equality core other afroamerican participants in the seminar were richard moore of the frederick douglass book center in new york lonnie x shabazz minister muhammads mosque no washington d c william j trent assistant personnel director for time inc and charles wilson a writereducator from new york city dr patterson and mr browne also participated in the conversations the negro in his struggle for an equal coexistence has been fed a teething biscuit with a gradualism flavor by his white counterpart in his trips downtown to negotiate that which is rightfully his he has been sent to the bargain basement with the staging of public demonstrations no longer capable of bluffing the white social regime into complete acceptance of the negro it is necessary that he abandon this weapon worn by repetition for a new and even more effective one the negro must unite into one force and together develop new ideas and methods of achieving true and genuine equality this can best be accomplished thru a master maneuver enacted by all black people and under close supervision of sincere leaders leaders whose every move is calculated and interpreted by a nationally elected committee a committee elected by a black vote and representative of that people a committee cognizant of negroes needs desires and goals realizing that the negroes present method for gaining equality is losing its effectiveness i would like to propose an idea designed to corporate all negroes and other liberal minded sympathizers into a tactful unit i suggest first listing the names twentyfive or more of responsible negroes negroes that are nationally known and whom black america feels is capable of legislating and controlling a mass negro movement the names submitted men and women by individuals or organizations would be negroes they feel possess the necessary qualifications to represent them and whose decisions they would respect and trust without censorship after composing such a list a national vote could be taken on the names received and the ten receiving the most votes would comprise the committee each committee member representing a certain number of states would have representation in that state these representatives primarily would be responsible for reaching negroes in their prospective precincts they will act as a liaison between the committee and the negro population relaying the strategy necessary to stage an effective national maneuver it is my firm belief that this committee with a nationally pledged negro support could effectively pressure the white society into complete admission people interested in discussing developing or modifying this idea may write to ronald l lyles central avenue washington d c enjoyed the march issue of negro digest with its informative notes on negro writers jazz etc clemmont e vontress article should your child attend a ne gro college particularly caught my attention his points concerning the autocratic often antiintellectual atmosphere of most negro campuses are very well taken however i think what is really needed is better negro colleges rather than none at all as the authors logic would suggest in spite of much superficial instruction it is worth noting the rich history of achievement that centers around the uncf colleges after all we didnt just spring from africa and arrive intact where we are now things happened things that are part of a history every negro needs to know at a time when negro intellectuals are bitterly grasping for some kind of meaningful racial identity there are many things that can be said in favor of attending a negro school at least for a while one thing the negro colleges have given southern negroes is an academic tradition however modest and a respect for family stability community achievement and the simple yes middle class things of the good life a lack of these traditions is what really makes harlem in sophisticated manhattan a bigger hell hole than atlanta ga pfc charles s brown fort monmouth new jersey black women dear editor any black woman who suffers from the wig and hot iron mentality deserves no respect the hot iron and wig are openbook manifestations that she doesnt respect herself arent you sick of seeing the wigladen paintfaced select few being trotted before the tv cameras they lean over backwards to satisfy one never hears so many oohs and ahs or sees so much skinning and grinning to please the white program host and audience i wonder if they have ever been schooled on the subject of a new day acomin or been hipped to the fact that there is a publication called negro digest it certainly is a sad day and no wonder a black writerprobably long ago dubbed responsible by the good white folkcomes out throwing love and kisses to a black woman singer for no longer wearing her hair natural the black woman must learn to respect herself the lack of her selfrespect is not limited to the hot iron and wig it reaches to far greater proportions the rank gall of some black women after reaching a certain stage in their climb to become a celebrity bemoaning the fact that there are no black men on their level is disgusting this is the best alibi that they can fabricate in order to do what they had in mind all along have white menand not necessarily in marriage it seems peculiar that so many black women embark upon careers in which white men are their chief benefactors could be that black women should stop concentrating so much on singing and dancing which so often be comes jigdancing footshuffling etc goodness knows that we have been entertained enough the black woman must break that ugly alliance with the white man that j often matures in halfwhite babies sitting on black knees she must stop j trying to build a logic around wigs and hot irons by using the tired excuse that miss ann also uses the beauty parlor why not a broad nose thick lips wide hips black skin i and natural hair all of these seem i to me to have been godgiven i i revere black women i respect a black women but only those who i live in the context of reality
in truth the hopes of the great society have been overcome by the fears and frustrations of vietnam the pursuit of this widened war has narrowed domestic welfare programs making the poor white and negro bear the heaviest burdens both at the front and at home the antipoverty program is cautiously initiated zealously supervised and evaluated for immediate results while billions are liberally expended for this illconsidered war the recently revealed misestimate of the war budget amounts to billion for a single year this error alone is more than five times the amount committed to antipoverty programs the security we profess to seek in foreign adventures we will lose in our decaying cities the bombs in vietnam explode at home they destroy the dream and possibility for a decent america if we reversed investments and gave the armed forces the antipoverty budget the generals could be forgiven if they walked off the battlefield in disgust poverty urban problems and social progress generally are ignored when the guns of war become a national obsession when it is not our security that is at stake but questionable and vague commitments to reactionary regimes values disintegrate into foolish and adolescent slogans it is estimated that we spend for each enemy we kill while we spend in the socalled war on poverty in america only about for each person classified as poor and much of that goes for salaries of people who are not poor we have escalated the war in vietnam and deescalated the skirmish against poverty it challenges the imagination to contemplate what lives we could transform if we were to cease killing america is a great nation but in this war she seems bent on her destruction through rugged and dazzling achievements america has become the richest and most powerful nation in the world we have built machines that think and instruments that peer into the unfathomable ranges of interstellar space we have built gargantuan bridges to span the seas and gigantic buildings to kiss the skies through our airplanes and spaceships we have dwarfed distance and placed time in chains and through our subways we have penetrated oceanic depths this year our gross national product will reach the astounding figure of billion all of this is a staggering picture of our great power but honesty impels me to admit that our power has often made us arrogant we feel that our money can do anything we arrogantly feel that we have everything to teach other nations and nothing to learn from them we often arrogantly feel that we have some divine messianic mission to police the whole world we are arrogant in not allowing young nations to go through the same growing pains turbulence and revolution that characterizes our history we arm negro soldiers to kill on foreign battlefields but offer little protection for their relatives from beatings and killings in our own south we are willing to make the negro per cent of a citizen in warfare but reduce him to per cent of a citizen on american soil of all good things in life the negro has approximately onehalf those of whites of the bad he has twice that of whites thus half of all nev groes live in substandard housing and he has half the income of whites when we turn to the negative experience of life the negro has a double share there are twice as many negroes in combat in vietnam at the beginning of and twice as many died in action per cent in proportion to their number in the population as whites all of this reveals that our nation has not yet used its vast resources of power to end the long night of poverty racism and mans inhumanity to man enlarged power means enlarged peril if there is not concomitant growth of the soul genuine power is the right use of strength if our nations strength is not used responsibly and with restraint it will be following actons dictum power that tends to corrupt and absolute power that corrupts absolutely our arrogance can be our doom it can bring the curtains down on our national drama ultimately a great nation is a compassionate nation we are challenged in these turbulent days to use our power to speed up the day when every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain let me say finally that i oppose the war in vietnam because i love america i speak out against it not in anger but with anxiety and sorrow in my heart and above all with a passionate desire to see our beloved country stand as the moral example of the world i speak out against this war because i am disappointed with america there can be no great disappointment where there is no great love i am disappointed with our failure to deal positively and forthrightly with triple evils of racism extreme materialism and militarism we are presently moving down a deadend road which can lead to national disaster those of us who love peace must organize as effectively as the war hawks as they spread the propaganda of war we must spread the propaganda of peace we must combine the fervor of the civil_rights movement with the peace movement we must demonstrate teach and preach until the very foundations of our nation are shaken we must work unceasingly to lift this nation that we love to a higher destiny to a new plateau of compassion to a more noble expression of humaneness in october a year after the forma i i tion of the cardozo area arts committee the new school for afroamerican thought was opened and celebrated with a weekend of music drama and art that attracted guests and performers not only from the washington area but also from cleveland pittsburgh new york city and philadelphia within the year they had been organized the committee had held several fund raising efforts became incorporated and rented and decorated a storefront building for classes in art negro history dance basic education music and tutoring services for the neighborhood children the school located in the heart of the cardozo ghetto is managed by a board of directors composed of residents of the area the idea for the school came from gaston neal a poverty program worker who believed that the residents would participate in cultural programs if they could have their own facilities and could have a hand in planning their own programs while the new school is located near howard university which offers many cultural advantages neal felt that the people in the ghetto would not feel comfortable at howard members of the ninemember board and their friends contributed labor and services to cut the cost of making the building fit for use as auditorium classrooms and offices the twostory building once housed an auto repair shop the concrete floors of the main floor were painted battleship gray the back of the stage a slidomatic garage door is painted yellow and is used to bring in and take out large pieces of equipment and musical instruments for the opening artists loaned paintings a piano was borrowed and an announcement was made during the opening program that many items were needed and those wishing to make contributions could do so the director gaston neal is a neighborhood worker for the united planning organization the poverty program organization in washington d c he was born and grew up in pittsburgh and dropped out of school in the ninth grade when a school teacher told him he should take a trade rather than aspire to be a writer for playing hookey and breaking some street lights neal was committed to a reformatory for months many of the times when he played hookey neal could be found in a museum or at an observatory using his cents lunch money for admission fees after he quit school neal bummed around he sold newspapers in night clubs until four in the morning at he tried to enlist in the army but was turned down at he went into the army and learned practical nursing at walter reed army hospital in dc while in the army neal did a lot of reading and began to also do some writing he absorbed the works of langston hughes and richard wright and began writing about the negro gradually he drifted into writing prose poetry after the army he went back to pittsburgh and took odd jobs such as portering or washing dishes for the past years neal has lived in washington and boston as well as in pittsburgh associating with people who are interested in writing music drama dance and art in boston he made friends of harvard students and by listening and reading picked up knowledge beyond his formal junior high school training it was out of this background that gaston neal joined other neighborhood workers and residents whose interests were similar they banded together in the cardozo arts committee spurred by neals drive enthusiasm initiative and ability the group was incorporated organized such events as a weekend of soul and a sale of neighborhood art works when the new school of afroamerican thought opened in washington the cinder block and brick walls were freshly painted and a sympathetic mixed audience half white and half negrowas in attendance the house was crowded to capacity gaston neal greeted the guests thanked them for coming promised them that the opening was only a taste of better things to come and introduced stokely carmichael stokely dapper in dark suit said its good to be here and be a part of such an auspicious opening when i was a child my mother said that negroes were loud mama also said that boys are too loud here in this school we will be able to have loud music if it is a part of our culture we will be able to study art from primitive african to modern together we can raise the level of art to where it belongs we can hook up with that which was lost and reestablish it the opening of this school which began as an idea last year to a reality tonight is testimony of the fact that a baby lived sterling brown poet of howard university greeted the audience briefly congratulating the management on the establishment of the school he said this school was a long time acoming brown considered an angry young man in the early s spoke of his teaching experience in the south and how he had learned after college of the real pressures endured by the southern negroes he read his own poems of negro blues jazz and folklore he read a poem about ma rainey who taught bessie smith to sing the blues when bessie was singing in a church choir he read old lem they come by tens and strong men for sterling brown and for all of the performers there was an almost reverent quiet the audience appeared to be students artists devotees of the arts exceptionally sympathetic with the performers night club singer and recording artist donald leace played a guitar and sang folk songs and spirituals between songs he told how he had visited a class taught at howard university by sterling brown and how he had followed browns suggestion to get folk songs from the library of congress he sang a song of a roadgang chained together at the mississippi state penitentiary leace told how the men sang as they broke rocks to be used for a roadbed the audience joined him in the refrain of every time feel the spirit poet owen dodson chairman of the drama department at howard read some of his poetry we shall never die about the struggle of the jews i am a part of this and confessional his student louise heath read a song cycle of mary mother of jesus l written by dodson argo recording star buck clark who is also a painter played the bongo drums a b spellman poet and magazine writer read some of his poetry the beautiful days adventure of zapato the twist my unborn and wretched children william white john coltrane and jelly roll morton spellman also read some poetry by gaston neal autumn and i looked i and saw history on a hinge george ellis showed a film he wrote and produced ewuzi the title means murder in twi a ghanj ian dialect the film was shot in a ghetto where a negro boy was killed by a policeman for stealing a loaf of bread it was an arty short film strip showing many of the horrors of poverty in the ghetto from the karamu house in cleveland the black arts theatre performers came and read from leroi jones dutchman they also read from james baldwins blues for mr charlie gloria parker read juanitas soliloquy which told of the death of her lover and she expressed her desire to be pregnant in memory of her lover james farrell read funeral sermon after the readings gaston neal introduced lonnie x shebazz the leader of the

how the history of yoruba began in nigerian culture and was taken to cuba brazil and trinidad the troop was dressed in yoruba attire and prayed chanted beat drums and shook beaded gourds for half an hour when bill harris local school teacher and night club performer played his guitar a bass fiddler from pittsburgh doffed his hat and played a background for him today over onequarter million negroes are attending colleges and universities in this country nearly twothirds of these are enrolled in predominantly negro institutions located in the south and border states are privately supported the remainder or are taxsupported in the main these institutions now house the negro leadership of tomorrow it is from these that one would expect to come tomorrows martin_luther_kings roy wilkenses stokely carmichaels and floyd mckissicks however such a possibility is remote for negro college students have become apathetic to the cause as a negro college professor put it recently they are more interested in their fronts suits wheels cars and skins degrees than they are in the voting rights of negroes in mississippi and alabama in fact the negro campus has become a bastion of conservatism although the students wear their hair au naturel and go to hear stokely carmichael when he comes to campus they are in the main most concerned about getting ahead this means holding down a good job attending negro fraternity and sorority dances and carnivals in downtown hotel ballrooms and living quietly in black suburbia away from all that jazz about civil_rights they merely put in time in college knowing that if they play their cards right they too can live in black suburbia the majority do not want to run the risk of being kicked out of college because of their participation in activist rights programs they have seen what happened to fellowstudents and professors who spoke up ousted students are back home working at menial jobs and the profs many of whomespecially at the height of the civil_rights movement had to leave overnight their teaching posts in southern colleges are in the case of good ones teaching in liberal white institutions in the north or in the case of marginal ones teaching in high schools in the nations ghettos thus wouldbe campus radicals have gotten the message and fast the profs cannot run the risk of losing their expensive homes in black suburbia by participating in civil_rights activities in fact many college presidents encourage new professors to buy homes as soon as possible once they arrive on campus in this way the administration can more easily control their activities in visiting atlanta baton rouge knoxville and baltimore just to mention a few cities where major negro colleges are located one is struck by black college enclaves in which there are homes to be had ranging from to on racial matters residents of these of white legislators or benefactors for support of institutions which they head thus negro college professors have contributed to student apathy on campuses where they teach for some time now it has been recognized that negro leadership has typically been classified into two polar types of behavior accommodation and protest undoubtedly the largest accommodational group in this country is composed of negro college professors while many of them identify strongly with the race at least in privacy their espousal of the negro cause is academic in general they tend to have values similar to those of the white middleclass stronger desires to associate with whites more internalization of negative attitudes toward other negroes and relatively weaker ethnic identification than individuals in lower status positions in the south they like whites have a vested interest in segregation they boast of their nice homes swimming pools and foreign trips while simultaneously criticizing other negroes for acting like niggers in atlanta for example the negro class structure is as rigid as the racial structure upperclass negroes and college professors are generally considered in this category among negroes whose economic security has depended on the white community have accepted discrimination though utilizing in many cases their positions to avoid cruder forms of racial discrimination thus they enjoy a life of ease behind the segregated curtain because they are protected from having to compete with whites the outsiders having accepted so completely their way of life they often feel that it is foolhardy for other negroes not to strive for what they havea nice home in segregated suburbia and a solid place in black society it is understandable that teachers directly or indirectly contribute to the placidity of their students although they are surrounded by social injustice their lectures remain enervate and purblind the student who challenges them is often referred to the counseling center for social adjustment the nice quiet respectful and conservative student is the one who gets the as and ultimately the diploma so proper is the negro college professor that he is literally afraid to take a stand on civil_rights perhaps this is understandable in the south where negro colleges are controlled by white conservatives andor liberalsboth from the north and the southon whom the private colleges depend for contributions more difficult to comprehend however is the behavior of college professors at such universities as howard where ehomes are as conservative as the whites who control their lives through the college presidents who must depend directly or indirectly on the goodwill franklin frazier the late noted sociologist worked for many years while he was acclaimed internationally especially for his book the black bourgeoisie he was persona non grata not only on his own campus but on negro campuses throughout the country in his book dr frazier analyzed the pastimes and interests of the black middleclass in america he therefore caused much consternation among negro intellectuals in general when the book came off the american press in a noted sociologist who at that time was at southern university in baton rouge louisiana was so infuriated that he avowed to go right out and write a book refuting everything frazier had said to this day however his book has not been heard of following in fraziers footsteps is a young chicago university phd nathan hare also now at howard his book the black anglosaxons has created so much furor that he now reports that he is in danger of losing his professorship at the nations most outstanding negro university another negro scholar said that he hoped dr hare will not fritter away his career in contentions over this mass of controversial irrelevances on this score it is interesting to note that white faculty members at negro colleges are given considerable freedom to analyze the negro problem but when a negro professor on the same faculty attempts to do the same he is usually repri manded and runs the risk of being booted out as a troublemaker this is probably why today most of the scholarship on the negro is being written by whites not negroes frequently a few students will take up for their favorite professors who tell it like it is but the college administrators retort that the professors are not there to create racial upheaval but to teach that is teach like it is from the book which is generally written not to be offensive to anybody negro college students are also responsive to the demands of their parents mothers and fathers save and scrape to send their children to college to get book lamin they want them to come back home and be somebody therefore parents take a dim view of sons and daughters who get kicked out of college for getting mixed up in civil_rights actually parents are not always thinking for themselves for it is a known fact that white employers are often instrumental in financing in part at least negro youths in college were it not for mothers washing and scrubbing to send black youth to college many would not be able to go stokely carmichael relates often how his mother worked as a maid in long island for a week to send him to college and how the white lady for whom she worked wanted him a bright colored boy to go to college in the south many of the negro students come even today from sharecropper farms when the landowners discover that their tenants sons and daughters are causing trouble in college they will see to it that times get hard for the parents it is not just professors and parents who indoctrinate negro college students with conservatism perhaps the most influential in this area are the college presidents themselves in addition to controlling the profs they also have a significant influence on their student bodies in the main the negro college is a small institution ranging from to students with the average enrollment being slightly over on such a campus the president has frequent and close contact with the students often he walks through the halls of classroom buildings in the way of high school principals whom students have known back home he the president of a churchrelated or statecontrolled college or university reminds students constantly that they must be ladies and gentlemen above all this means dressing in sundaygomeeting clothes for dinner and staying off the streets like common negroes essentially he is more interested in his students being proper than he is in their learning to think for themselves during sunday convocations and wednesday evening vespers he admonishes students to lead a good life this means being men among men in other words he tells them that they must go out into an integrated society where the color of a mans skin doesnt matter that people are accepted according to what they are not who they are recently one college president advised his students to give up some of their soul ethnic identification if they wanted to be fully accepted in the american society this he said means learning to think talk and act like other americans significantly adults are not the only purveyors of apathy among negro college students today on a broader scale one might say that the total society has shaped the negros whole attitude toward his j existence as a human being in our j society as a member of a society characterized by discrimination the student although negro the subject of discrimination cannot see or understand the wrong that is being done him thus he cannot see he does not accept the propo i sition that negroes in this country suffer injustices because they happened to have been born black j in general the negro students world view is limited by tunnel j vision and egocentricism when asked why he is in college his reply is apt to be that he wants to make a better life for himself in contrast the african student when asked the same question generally relates his being in college to going back home to help his people last summer a young liberian studying economics at the university of wisconsin explained that my specialization is fundamental to help mg my people realize our national goals in other words the negro student like the american society as a whole is materially oriented whereas the african student is politically or nationally oriented differences in purposes for being in college make for strained relationships between negro americans and africans in this country it is because of these differences that americans and negro americans do not relate well one to the other on our college campuses a student from ethiopia reported recently that american negroes never have anything interesting to talk about about african students one american negro retorted that he gets tired of talking about politics all the time it appears that the tense relationship existing between black africans and their american counterparts may be attributed to what the africans perceive as indifference to social injustice on the part of the negro traditionally africans have sought to repeal and counteract injustice in a direct manner when they see american negro students laughingly going about their merry way and indeed seldom discussing intently the american dilemma they are somewhat dismayed to say the least apathy is also a result of racial separatism on the one hand and racial inclusion on the other socially the negro remains exclusive while simultaneously being a part of the total culture in which he lives his major ideas and attitudeshis weltanschauung if you willcome from the total culture not just his subculture in essence then he is driven to demand social changes when the total society promotes or initiates or at least provides an atmosphere for such a demand in the meantime his emphasis is on personal change not group that is subgroup change thus the individual student is interested in what he can do to improve his life not the life of his people as is the case with most african students whom he encounters on american campuses often this attitude is perpetuated through lack of acquaintance with vital issues which is obtained through staying abreast of social problems and alternatives to stay abreast of relevant issues is to stay in touch with ones immediate and current environment this means reading the daily papers and keeping up with the melange of social issues which affect our daily lives individuals who are acquainted with their history and know how it relates not only to their position individually but to the position of their race in general are the ones who are in tune with their immediate environment this implies that students who read and think about things which are not presented in their classrooms by their professors are far ahead of those who sit like buckets waiting to be filled thus in the final analysis the blame for apathy on the negro campus cannot be laid directly at the feet of any person or persons but the student himself so long as students remain passive listeners to impetuous speakers of the stokely carmichael ilk so long as they evaluate activist speeches as entertainment so long as they refuse to accept these as calls for action they will remain passive observers they will remain bystanders to what is happening around them and in so doing they will remain as a segment of the negro population the lumpenproletariat those who are least capable of engaging in concerted action to improve their lot in the meantime the struggle for civil_rights will undoubtedly be carried on by the present but limited number of young activists these in the main are dropouts or kickouts from southern and northern colleges for example during the summer of about onethird of the activists engaged in voter registration activities throughout the south were for the most part dropouts from white colleges and universities in the north and a handful who had attended negro colleges before becoming disenchanted with their campus existence others were jobless individuals who had latched on to the movement to find a place for themselves one young man a philosophy major at anderson college had been with the movement for three years either with sclc or a related group he reported that he had been offered a scholarship to continue his education but thought he would rather stay at his work in the south besides he had made a lot of friends while in the movement one of these a young blonde about he introduced as having been a student at mount holyoke how long the present group of young and sometimes crude and often undisciplined radicals can continue to carry the activist push for civil_rights by themselves remains to be seen how long they can withstand negative reactions to their aweinspiring slogans solicits speculation from present indications it seems safe to say that unless negro college students become socially involved and sensitive to the fulfillment of these rights leadership of and direction to the civil_rights movement will revert to whites in essence whites will determine what the goals of the movement shall be the chances of future martin_luther_kings roy wilkinses and stokely carmichaels coming forward to replace those already on the line will be nil recent events in africa have shown that something went wrong not only with the body p iic y f that continent but also with the ideology and the philosophy on which the african continents commitment to total freedom was founded men of goodwill who are interested in the future of africa and the welfare of the africans will agree that at this critical moment of human history africans ought to trace back their locus and reassume the beliefs and values that displayed their toga virillis and sounded the death knell of foreign domination they will also agree that the blessings of human and ethnic diversities have to be fully exploited if africa is to survive the second half of the twentieth century oddly enough many of the socalled african experts are postulating that tribalism and its intensity in africa are functions of education and that the more educated the african the more tribalistic he becomes this of course is a superficial generalization and total nonsense however we cannot deny the fact that some educated and corrupt africans tend to exploit the ethnic diversity in africa for their own selfish ends these selfish and unpatriotic demagogues have been partly repudiated by the present disruption in some parts of africa they will be totally disgraced when africans return to the philosophy that in part led to the political emancipation of africa this is the philosophy of zikism which as a package contains all the drugs that are capable of curing the present african illness and conglutinate all forces working for the good of africa zikism forms the core of what its exponents called renascent africa and is grounded on five postulates spiritual balance social regeneration economic determination mental emancipation and political resurgence renascent africa emerged in the latter s and grew into adolescence in the s it was given birth by the african youths whom dr james e k aggrey had prophesied would do the job dr aggrey saw the end of slavery in africa and also witnessed the beginning of modern education in that continent he foresaw a youth movement coming into africa that some day may startle the world said he this restlessness all over africa stands for selfdiscovery selfrealization it tells of power just breaking through the five zikist postulates will be examined separately to determine how they have been applied in the past and how they can be applied now and in the future as africa journeys toward her greater glory spiritual balance africa became a breeding ground of many missionary activities after the end of the slave trade needless to say these missionaries were and are stillchristians in many cases the missionary activities created conflicts and confusion there was conflict among various christian churches there was confusion between the christians the indigenous religious sects and islam at the heart of this confused state was the need for understanding the need to respect the views of others and the need for a liveandletlive attitude toward others these needs were to be met if africans in the process of being christianized and practicing christianity were to develop a spiritual balance divorced from the extremes and dichotomies of rightness and wrongness and therefore have the capacity to blend ideas for the purposes of progress rather than for the possibilities of self and socialdestruction it was only through this balance that africa would make yet another great contribution to the human race a contribution that dr blyden beautifully noted in a speech in when he said among other things africa may yet prove to be the spiritual conservatory of the world just as in past times egypt proved the stronghold of christianity after jerusalem fell and just as the noblest and greatest of the fathers of the christian church came out of egypt so it may be when the civilised nations in consequence of their wonderful material development shall have had their spiritual perceptions darkened and their spiritual susceptibilities blunted through the agency of a captivating and absorbing materialism it may be that they may have to resort to africa to recover some of the simple elements of faith for the promise of that land is that she shall stretch forth her hand unto god a very important element of the spiritual balance postulate is respect for the views of others in the field of religion in many parts of africa this respect has gained ground africans who were taught not to drink and eat in the houses of other religious groups have now learned to do the contrary and in many remote villages today it is not uncommon for catholics methodists anglicans and others to participate in harvests and bazaars and other common celebrations in the political field this respect developed but was later paralyzed by personality worship political jobbery and impatience politicians in their quest to become moneymakers and pose as the croesus of emerging africa became mean and intolerant in many african countries the leaders of opposition were recognized and paid out of the public treasury later some opposition members became prison targets and many of them crossed carpet either to avoid the myth and tag of the national enemies or on the pretext of adhering to one of the illdefined isms members of the opposition parties themselves were sometimes irresponsible and unpatriotic and therefore created doubt as to their abilities and sincerity to function as an alternate choice in the present state of affairs in africa the idea of spiritual balance should be made more practical by way of possible institutionalization it should be incorporated in civic courses and offered at all levels of education spiritual balance connotes sportsmanship statesmanship and the overall development of the individual and the society along a progressive continuum social regeneration social regeneration in the zikist context meant the detribalization of africa by africans africa has been naturally endowed with ethnic diversity which the slave trade exploited for a greater booty and which the berlin conference of distorted while engaged in what president leopold senghor of senegal called balkanization of africa the exploitation and the distortion left scars which are largely responsible for nigerians seeing themselves not as nigerians but as hausas ibos and yorubas ghanaians seeing themselves as fantis and gas and kenyans seeing themselves as kikuyus luos and kambas social regeneration called for what is ethical just and equitable when africans deal with themselves and with others and a total divorce from provincialism or localism the deadly weapon of tribalism as cities grew and be came laboratories of crossethnic diffusion and as communication facilities became widespread and relatively inexpensive detribalization became a must the penny press multitribal political parties and other organizations started to eradicate tribalism which was and still isa social vermin but the process of social regeneration dwarfed when cheap politicians started to preach the contrary when political leadership tended to decay when corrupt civil servants began to practice nepotism and turned their departments into family estates the process lost its tempo as some of the socalled african elite justified their crimes on tribal basis and evoked tribalism when confronted with the realities of justice honesty and duty furthermore the process was marred by religious fanaticism and the nostalgia of an empire that was long buried by the egalitarian wave that continues to blow on man and his conscience today social regeneration is another must for africa african educators must realize that it is one of the mature ingredients for peace progress and stability in africa the education of africans must therefore take it into consideration economic determination africa is the home of small farmers and petty traders these groups are well known for their rugged individualism and suspicion economic activities based on these characteristics are bound to stagnate and breed poverty and squalor the ethos of peasant farming and petty trading lacks effective bargaining position and is liable to fall as easy prey to foreign monopolistic economic activities economic determination in the zikist sense called for a wellgrounded and sound economic foundation for the development of african land labor and capital dr nnamdi azikiwe the leading exponent of zikism chided the africans for their psychological aversion to company formation and noted that the main reason for the difference between african and european business administration is the principle of cooperation the two words linked together mean working together azikiwe said further the european by pooling his financial resources together obtains a great capital with which to transact his business with this capital he gives employment to thousands he organizes branches of his business he makes important contacts he has good banking references and his business prospects are indicative of success if not in the immediate then in the remote future the african on the other hand prefers to work alone spending the greater part of his life in accumulating capital the african proceeds to control his business singlehandedly for a onemans business it works out temporarily but time will come when that one man will face problems which will require many heads to solve economic determination became a public policy goal in many african countries and had two main characteristics first the public sectors of these countries as members of the third world become the economic man and through the process of economic planning cooperation and coordination were required of all government departments second economic determination became the political catapult for launching the africanization process in the civil service in the private sector of the economy registered limited companies started to appear and with government aid and encouragement these companies achieved some degree of success some african businessmen got on the road to business modernization and were supported by indigenous banks which embarked on the policy of credit liberalization foreign private enterprises were persuaded to africanize their personnel or pack and go their commercial activities were limited to a certain segment of the marketing ladder and in some cases they were forced to accept african partnership training of indigenous personnel became a condition for new foreign enterprises planning to establish themselves in many parts of africa despite the above moves more has to be done to make economic determination a reality the cutthroat competition of many african petty traders and the proliferation that characterize some business activities a good example is rice milling in abakiliki eastern nigeria create excess capacities the call for economic cooperation has to be revived and people made to appreciate the wisdom of pooling resources to attain economic goals in the public sector the postindependence symbolic development must be halted and resources diverted to economic activities that are dynamic and capable of producing what gunnar myrdal called certain centrifugal spread effects of expansionary momentum from centers of economic expansion to other regions mental emancipation it is very common for some africans and some of the socalled africanists to overstate or exaggerate the african past for the simple sake of metooism it is even more common for the africaphobes to deny that africans ever had any history in fact as late as the s a british historian held that african history was nonexistent until the advent of the european overlords he wrote in part until the very recent penetration by europe the greater part of the african continent was without the wheel the plough and the transport animal almost without stone houses or clothes except for skins without writing and so without history this nonexistent thesis pervaded through the latter part of the th century but we do know that history is primarily made by people and has meaning because of its human content if africa ever had people they must have a history the existence of african history was further proved by the writings of such american scholars as w e b du bois and w l hansberry slavery the early missionary activities and later foreign domination at the doorstep made many africans think and feel that they were subhuman the painting black of the christian satan and the branding of things native as things diabolic led africans to develop fables admitting their own inferiority in the cameroons for example there is an old fable that tells how god created three sons a white man a black man and a gorilla while walking in the woods with his sons the gorilla and the black man got lost and god went on walking with the white man the zikists launched mental emancipation to educate the africans to have faith and confidence in themselves and all things african africans were told that biologically and otherwise they were equal to any other race in the world this revolution in thinking found expression in the writings of many african poets and people of african descent in the new world the latter spearheaded the search for racial identity and came up with the concept of the african personality while these writings became widely read in many african countries countries like nigeria came up with what the late mbonu ojike called bycott all bycottables the bycott doctrine stood for the glorification of african ways of life that were not inimical to african development it is in the arena of mental emancipation that zikism received its greatest response much to the dismay of the racists the average african now knows that he is a homme de bien this african realization must be exploited by african leadership in the building up of the continent political resurgence up to the midhalf of the twentieth century the african continent continued to be a political appendage of europe and was an important element of the european power struggle although the continent was a political football of european powers europeans held the view that africans were incapable of selfrule africans who had been educated in europe came back home as the noted beentos more english than the englishman and more french than the frenchman since they were assimilated as civilized natives they became strangers in their native land and parvenus of the learned clubs such acquired status enable those afroeuropeans to become assimilados in portugal notables evolues citoyens francais in france and hilldwellers of the british colonial administration having lost touch with their kind the afroeuropeans were politically paralyzed and incapable of questioning or fighting the status quo to this group of africans foreign domination was a datum and since they had been blessed to eat from the masters table the master had to be thanked and adored rather than attacked molested or alienated in short the group became totally blind to the lethargic pace of social economic and political development in africa and assumed a supine position and developed protruding stomachs the idea of political resurgence produced a dual attack on the po litical status quo first it called the africans attention to the fact that european hegemony was a recent phenomenon and not an act of god it demonstrated through various historical records that africans had enjoyed political independence in the past the existence of ethiopia atrophied the african servitude theory and the continued status of colonies as applied to africa was undemocratic unchristian and immoral second the zikists declared war on the african uncle toms then labelled old africa and called on the youths or new africa to wake up rise and shine at the early stage the political resurgence idea amounted to athanasius contra mundum to the colonial masters it was a minority agitation to the afroeuropeans it was reckless uncalled for and disruptive however the idea gained ground and the aftermath of world war ii coupled with the call for political freedom for all men everywhere added some form of exogenous factors to it there are now independent countries in africa each struggling with nationbuilding a journey which many countries all over the world are making or have made at one point in their history revive zikism the hysteria of political independence led to the drowning of zikism as a philosophy for political emancipation and nationbuilding the evolution of mushroom countries led to the establishment of local potentates surrounded by personality cults despite the fact that africa has become in the words of professor david finley a continent of conferences con tinental government one of the great dreams of zikism is as difficult today as continental government was in europe at the time of charlemagne in the face of african leaders perpetuating the colonial mentality african balkanization con m tinues as postindependence leadership in the african continent became internally corrupt and externally predatory a new wave of military regimes emerged young africans for whom colonial regimes are dim childhood memories are now finding themselves in a state of mental confusion because of the leadership vacuum that now prevails in many countries the situation is akin to what existed before the evolution of zikism thus the revival of the zikist philosophy is necessary and will provide african youths with a base for a further leap in the nationbuilding process revived zikism must be internalized by way of total domestication it should orient the youths to the noble task before them by teaching them the virtues of patriotism and the spirit of brotherhood duty and service since the original philosophy was dynamic and progressive its revived version should also maintain those attributes and should go all out to court and embrace not only the intellectuals and pseudointellectuals who parade the streets of lagos and nairobi but the total african society since zikism of the past had only access to the penny press the revived version should utilize all available communication media and should be incorporated as a complete course in civics for all african students in short efforts should be made to exploit the ideological content of zikism as a mobilizing factor in securing for africa and the africans a maximum developmental effort with a minimum of friction the two best known j r black artists in amerj j icacharles white and jacob lawrence charles white is by far the more popular it might even be said that charles white is to painting and drawing what langston hughes is to literature both men direct their art to primal human concerns to the simple problems and pleasures the ordinary joys and sorrows of the long journey from the cradle to the grave in his successful career as fulltime painter white like hughes has found favor and support among the black people who are his subjects more affluent collectors like harry belafonte and eartha kitt own one or more original works by white but thousands of ordinary people all over the country have for many years coveted the modestly priced reproductions which have been made available in art shops and book stores this spring for the first time a book devoted to charles white and his work has been published called images of dignity the drawings of charles white ward ritchie press the x a page volume contains photo reproductions of the artists drawings from an ink landscape executed in when the artist was seven to a charcoal representing black womanhood created especially as an ebony magazine cover in other features of the book are a foreword by harry belafonte who owns several white originals an appreciation by james a porter head of the department of fine arts and director of the art gallery at howard university and a long intimate perceptive commentary by benjamin horowitz owner of the heritage gallery in los angeles and the originator of the idea of the book of whites work the singer belafonte says there is a powerful sometimes violent beauty in his artistic interpretation of negro americana there is the poetic beauty of negro idiom this is the artists most profound contribution and it is significant that his art has never strayed far afield from the roots which gave birth to the artist himself in a period when many artists have deserted reality for the various schools of nonobjectivity and abstractionism mr white has continued to work for broader horizons of human expression and to explore deeper dimensions of truth and reality mr porter who is a distinguished artist in his own right says charles white is one of the great voices among those black americans who during the past i years have been the real interpreters of the american negro in this connection his oneman exhibitions have always been for me unforgettable events providing the highest opportunity for enlightenment through the revelation of powerful truths couched in a beautifully nuanced graphic poetry that unfailingly hits the mark indeed his art belongs not to one people but to all the world it is demonstrable that he has forged for himself an artistic language which transcends the boundaries set to art by a trivial subject matter or the shortlived vogue of social or political propaganda and mr horowitz says this in an era when the artist is expressing his detachment from the human condition by a cool and geometric style charles whites superb drawings challenge this lack of faith and selfinvolvement their epic quality affirms his deep concern for humanity his love of man and life and his belief that brotherhood is not just a catchword here on his canvasses the vitality and poignancy of humankind are captured for the eye to see and the heart to feel the artist who is part creek indian was born in chicago in he attended the burke elementary school where his interest in art was first aroused and later the chicago art institute school in the interim he also won two scholarships to local art schools but was rebuffed when he appeared to claim the scholarships he grew up during the depression and because of his talent was able to oin the famed works progress administration wpa art project where he remained for three years in along with a group of chicago artists he exhibited his work at howard university the other artists included archibald motley eldzier cortor bernard goss and charles sebree as a member of the arts and crafts guild he helped to organize the south side community art center during the late thirties and early forties whites work was exhibited in a number of cities and galleries and his reputation grew he also met and became friend or associate of a number of talented black people who were to make an impact on the cultural life of the nation among these were gordon parks katherine dunham gwendolyn brooks e simms campbell richard wright margaret walker theodore ward and willard motley in and white received rosenward foundation awards and in he finished the x feet mural at hampton institute which is one of his landmark works other white murals are in the chicago public library and at tuskegee institute a visit to mexico introduced white to that countrys artists the great david siqueiros among them and to the art of lithography he returned from mexico and lived for awhile in new york city where he met and was influenced by such artists as robert gwathmey and philip evergood and men like w e b du bois langston hughes and paul robeson he traveled in europe and returned to find that his reputation had grown even more in america the metropolitan museum of art exhibited his work in and his works were purchased by the whitney museum howard university and atlanta university for reasons of health white and his second wife left new york in and settled in the los angeles area where they now live frantz fanon s peau noire masques blancs black skin white masks first published in in french was made accessible to the englishspeaking public for the first time with the translated version brought out by grove press last spring this book will be of special interest to those already familiar with fanons the wretched of the earth grove press the collected body of fanons work all published originally in french is slowly becoming available in english though not in chronological order a brief resume may be helpful here peau noire masques blancs black skin white masks appeared in paris followed in by sociologie dune revolution lan v de la revolution algerienne published in translation as studies of a dying colonialism by monthly review press in the nowfamous les damne de la terre wretched of the earth made its original appearance in paris interestingly enough in there appeared posthumously in paris a collection of political and revolutionary writings scanning the period but with a preponderance of the articles written in the period pour la revolution africaine to be available in english in the fall of as toward the african revolution monthly review press if you have read his last and probably his most polished wretched of the earth you will now be able to look at his first serious fulllength statement of the whiteblack problem if this is to be your first experience of fanon you are fortunate to be able to take him up in chronological order for black skin white masks has a profoundly sincerely personal point of departure fanon published the book a young man of just after having completed his psychiatric training in an attempt to come to terms with the problem of racism and the deculturization and loss of identity engendered by it thus at the beginning of his career he had already blocked out what was to be his own special field of endeavor for the remaining ten years or so of his life in all serenity i think that it would be a good thing if certain things were said we read these words on the first page they are like the final line of the first stanza of a poem a minute or so further along we read this book should have been written three years ago but then truths were setting us aflame the underlying personal source is avowed from the beginning and a lyricism springs forth from these first pages which on occasion soars to the level of the poetic quest of man after his own nature his basic theme as the prefacer francis jeanson states is his own blackness his experience as a black man plunged into a white world the preface is from the original edition a postface was included in also by francis jeanson the purpose in the first case must certainly have been to break the shock for a largely white audience for fanons frankness is at times brutaland jeanson seems to feel obliged to justify the theme fully the postface portrays rather romantically fanons writings in terms of his beliefs with some reference to his lived experience the book proper is organized around an introduction in which fanon speaks in general terms of what he calls double narcissism the white who feels himself superior and the black who is bent on showing the white that he is his intellectual equal a vicious circle is then set up there appears to be no exit fanon suggests that only a psychoanalytical interpretation of the black problem can reveal the affective anomalies which are responsible for the complexual edifice he examines aspects of this complexual edifice in chapters dealing with the black mans attitude toward language the attitude of the woman of color toward the white man that of the man of color toward the white woman he gives his attention to the dependency complex of the colonized man then in an existential frame of mind and in a style reminiscent of the streamofconsciousness novel he turns to the thought processes and the emotional reactions of the black man being looked upon by a white world he is an object a stereotype fanon clearly prefigures his later writings in a chapter dealing with the negro and psychopathology then proceeds to examine whiteblack confrontation from adlerian and hegelian points of departure his last chapter is significantly en i titled by way of conclusion throughout the reader recognizes the environment in which fanons impressions and perceptions developed and matured the colonial west indies unproud humble in its underdeveloped status as a farremoved appendage of the glittering mothercapital the situation of the colonial student once in france coming face to face with white attitudesand white women the great majority of the examples and specific incidents are drawn from these two situations but the book is more than this fanon is writing after the emotional turmoil has subsided after the formalization of insight brought about by psychiatric training and unfolding before us we see a first attempt at a coherent statement of problem and causes a thought which starts other thoughts in motion a statement which is sometimes incomplete and sometimes hard to follow because the indirect statement of poetry and lyricism occasionally gives way to clinical style and an assumption that the reader is acquainted with technical and specialized literature but the statement remains dynamic inspiring ecause dancing behind it and luring us on we know there is an answer sensed but not yet attained peau noire masques blancs is a positive act and through its mere expression begins our bodily and mental liberation and weas did

curious but notable anthology of poetry for malcolm poems on the life and death of malcolm_x broadside edited by dudley randall and margaret burroughs beams a radiance few critics can dispute malcolms holocaust was a dramatization of our societys absurdity in dealing with people of african heritage malcolm died in the tradition of rare prophets these poems cover with clarity and honesty his career as a hustler prisoner muslim statesman and finally a moving spirit malcolm belongs to all ages he belongs to that feral voodooism which allows some men to seep through our fetid materialism he magnified through his words and deeds a royal alternative for doomed blacks he made marching middleclass blacks reexamine a white god and a black life he made a black god impossible and a white the editors have selected poems which treat malcolm as the prince of black manhood wordsworth said that poetry should speak of the man the malcolm one finds in this anthology is the christ one finds in the bible he is ghettorisen a philosophicaltragedy a soul brother a political seer a black christ weeping a denmark vesey urbanized a human thunderstorm more wretched than faceless waifs a song seeking melody why was he angry what made him an outlaw ossie davis brilliantly responds to those questions in his candid preface the poems in this anthology sprang forth from malcolms caravanserai they express malcolms brief life the mystery of his existence and the wry discontent of his distant drum beating out his seeds of wisdom and great argument and not even an hour has passed since

the poets in this anthology sense the phantasy the hideous dreams in council with the man several poets seem to remember only one thing about malcolm his manhood for that which these poets loved most in malcolm seems clearer in his absence malcolms strange mixture of lights his exquisite negroness stripped of americana his islamic intuition and mass charisma comes through in the lyricism of this poetic requiem the interpenetration of negritude expresses itself in malcolms dialogue on earth the negro middleclass may miss the point since many of the conceptual images allude to the movement critics who dwell on the mellowness and softness of cullen and dunbar may not feel the ancient regime of stereotype subside to newer perceptions and feelings among todays black poets white poets like louis simpson will feel dismayed and left out not unless they now dance in the ballroom of malcolms truth simpson once believed the negro was incapable of creating good poetry there are poems in this volume simpsons talent could never bring forth dudley randall and margaret burroughs distinguish themselves by presenting new sophisticated voices angry voices anarchic bards but any real work of art must deal with the individual complexities of philosophy and life this book is a literary ghetto virgin one of many books that black people must publish themselves it is the most encouraging sign of black consciousness that ive witnessed lately the illumination of malcolms soul is so powerful that we must mark the pages for humanity for whoever touches this booktouches malcolm this is a book of truth as well as poetry this is malcolms aesthetic primer this is a black book malcolms soul is at rest bound by love and depression within these pages etheridge knight a first novel the last day of lin by gordon m williams is better coin charles stein day than could be deduced from the jacket blurb the author may have had his sights fixed on movie rights and the novel does have a cinematic documentary technique but it is still a better piece of work than the publishers imply in their lid off an english seaside town copy an american negro soldier chicagoborn and lonely gets drunk in a pub one night and vaguely remembers a woman the next morning a girl complains that she has been raped by a colored man and lincoln charless last day begins a brutal sergeant lovingly contemplates the time when charles will be at his mercy in the stockade the yearold boy starts forlornly to make a list of people who might help him but a contemptuous word from a cook corporal touches him on the raw he throws scalding coffee at his tormentor and crosses the line into violence as he ran between the wooden barrack huts of g squadron private lincoln charles shouted at bull krasko and all the other men who were his enemies shouted at them silently in his mind he knew exactly what he was going to do he was going to stop them once and for all from this point on private charles is lost and it is part of the authors achievement that as the long day wears on the tension never slackens seaton with its corrupt mayor its weak chief constable of police its ambitious frustrated newspaper men and the various dubieties surrounding the bathing beauty contest gives at the pressure points as charles with his carbine repeater ready proceeds on his hopeless quest for justice and revenge for a time like a drunk crossing a busy street he bears a charmed life but inevitably he dies on a deserted beach goaded beyond reason by the circumstances of his life and the stupidity ineptitude and cruelty of his fellow men it is an unsentimental novel and its subject is not a hero even though the end is violent lincoln charles is not the victim of a lynch mob he is destroyed by an indifferent selfprotecting society composed of the british facesavers and the american military machine gordon williams moves easily in the idioms of both countries and has cast his drama perceptively with characters who are credible and typical without being cliches that they are none of them likeable is scarcely surprising too often famous or infamous events of history are reduced to clashes between institutions and symbols even when the chief adversaries take on the guise of men they become institutions in the eyes of those who later attempt to explain what happened napoleon for example was a man and we partially know him as such it is also true that we know him as a typea symbol he is also to a very great extent an institution tana de gamezs the yoke and the star bobbsmerrill is a book that attempts to give us an understanding of the people involved in the cuban revolution of as personalities historical novels which is the genre of the yoke and the star have license to tell about a historical event without religiously adhering to the facts this same license allows the writer to give color and life to men and women involved who might otherwise lack these attributes missda gamez is not successful in either of the roles a successful historical novelist can play the book does not make the characters live as people but represents them as symbols and institutions also we are not provided with enough color or life in the characters to overcome the first deficiency the book is certainly not without points to recommend it we are provided with a glimpse of the kind of people who are necessary to execute the kind of event unfortunately this is too little to save the book itself the emphasis upon negritude in african writing in french inspired its countervailing force in its rejection by nigerian practitioners of their own sullen craft they with their ghanaian counterparts have for the most part resisted what they deemed a cultural imperialism an imposition from an alien source namely africans speaking french their reaction was epitomized by wole soyinka in his oftquoted remark to the effect that since the tiger does not stalk about crying his tigritude why then is it necessary for the negro to proclaim his negritude senghors reply in his howard university speech in september was scarcely calculated to inspire the reconciliation for which he is celebrated in so many words he laments that the brute saxons have evidently beaten an inferiority complex into their colonials cerebella let us only remark that whatever course the debate will take both writers possess imposing talents and will doubtlessly acquit themselves well soyinkas feeling however is shared by many others it has been expressed in a different sense by alioune diop one of the architects of the reconstruction of the african cultural edifice it is a sad thing diop has said to find it necessary to extol ones race at this historical juncture however in the century of the color problem it is a necessary task the world is emerging from its hierarchical vision of mankind and such evangelism is an inevitable stage through which the evolutionary process must pass soyinka however cannot accept what he seems to consider to be merely a forensic necessity his explanation reminds us of the first roosevelts injunction to speak softly but carry a big stick it seems after all it is this which is more akin to soyinkas intent than to reject as many think he has done the effort to recapture the african identity according to report soyinka in berlin in clarified his attitude it is true he said the tiger is silent on the subject but this does not mean he does not demonstrate a tigritude he lies in wait to pounce upon his prey and to perform a very specific tigritude similarly the implication is obvious negritude also though not proclaimed may be nonetheless a reality a consideration of soyinkas writing posed against the evangel of leopold senghor foremost articulator of negritude will not enable us to pin the former neatly on a map but perhaps to learn something of the terrain on which he stalks about comparison is made difficult by the fact that the two write in different media soyinka is essentially a playwright while senghor is a poet it is axiomatic that poetry lends itself more freely to the demands of the creative imagination senghor in writing a poem is not subjected to the same necessity of plot motivation of character etc although the difference impedes the contrast it does not totally obscure it our concern is with the presence in their work of an african inspiration which may be expressed although differently in either form the pervading tone of senghors work is one of faith an affirmation of faith in his continent his people and more broadly in mankind and in life itself his is a whitmanesque embrace of the other a pantheism finding the life spirit in all things as well as in being in every aspect of nature this pantheistic emphasis however is not indiscriminate the clearly evident and overwhelming love in senghors work is for his homeland and his people it is at once a personal and a very public poetry he retreats within himself to externalize in his essentially declamatory manner the traditional values of africa of old his is a work of nostalgia the nostalgia of exile of redemption of a fallen people affirming and celebrating their past greatness in the return of the prodigal son he returns to the land of his ancestors after the years of wandering in europe elephant of mbissel hear my reverent prayer give me

the white smile of my mother tomorrow i shall take again the road to europe road of my embassy homesick for my black land it is quickly evident that almost a generation separates the two writers an observer remarked in that as he examined the content of presence africaine he was far more interested in the cultural aspects of the african experience than in the voluminous embroilment in the unfolding political scene the editor replied however that the cultural life could not flourish until the political conditions to nourish it were achieved this preindependence struggle between africa and europe was a major influence in shaping the creative consciousness of senghor running as a dominant motif throughout his work is the counterpoint of color the conflict between africa and the west senghor is forerunner he announces the goal he proclaims a new vision he rejects the old western domination focusing upon the tensions inher ent in the struggle toward freedom in his choosing between isabella and soukeina for koras and balafong iii in his prayer to the masks in his poetic encounter with new york we see how his work is pervaded with an awareness of the conflict as professor in the lycee in tours and in paris he muses as he watches his fair students you my lambs my delight with eyes that shall not look upon my age i was not always a shepherd of fair heads on the arid plains of your books not always the good official deferring to his superiors the good colleague polite elegant with glovessmiling but rarely laughing old france old university all the old routine my lambs my childhood is as old as the world and i am as young as the everlasting youth of the worlds dawn the poetesses of the sanctuary have given me suck the kings griots have sung me the authentic legend of my race to the sounds of the high koras soyinka to the contrary evinces no concern over the clash between europe and africa the reader searches in vain for the evidence that soyinka is even slightly aware of what looms for senghor as an overweening cosmic rupture into i am black and you are white with perhaps one exceptionhis well known encounter with the london landlady one can simply wonder whether this absence of racial motif stems from conscious decision or from the natural direction of soyinkas creative impulse obviously his early creative years were not shaped as were senghors by the political issues that dominated preindependence africa the political struggle against britain had been conducted largely by the generation which preceded him his relatively brief student years at the university at leeds contrast sharply with two decades of senghors exile amid the sly silences of the european night soyinka appears centrally oriented toward an essentially african experience a sophisticated intelligence at home in either culture but obsessed with no pervasive sense of conflict between the two for soyinka negritude would be as the term negro in elijah mohammads theocracy an invention of the devil a name inspired by the raceconscious west in none of his plays nor evidently in most of his poetry is soyinka concerned with the conflict of europe and africa in a searching essay however entitled and after the narcissist appearing in the african forum spring soyinka makes the accusation that senghor declaims upon the african reality but fails to produce it senghors poetry he asserts falls short of achieving the wonders it celebrates remaining static and sterile in a narcissistic contemplation of the poet himself he accuses senghor of deception in that while purporting to celebrate the black poet and to glorify the african heritage he is in actuality indulging in an increasingly monotonous selfadulation he fails to achieve the animist awareness to transform the minutiae of experience into the word of a new psychic sensibility which according to soyinka is at the heart of the african poetic heritage the charge touches upon a basic aspect of the creative impulse and should help to illumine the differences between the two the essay is immediately noteworthy in the clarification it affords regarding what some have taken to be as we have indicated a rejection by soyinka of negritude and of the existence of a unique african sensibility the reaction to this cultural imperialism can be understood in large measure by the resentment more hinted at than made plain against a movement purportedly imposing canons of literary and psychic law to which the hopefuls of ibadan and accra would have to adhere the creative instinct being by definition largely a reaction against fiat the result should not have been difficult to foresee it is ironic that this cast in iron aspect of negritude a force conceived to remove the western cultural yoke was probably due in large measure to wellintentioned europeans who were among the earliest enthusiasts of an african renaissance their missionary zeal to carry the word beyond dakar appears to have inspired a counter force which seemed at first sheer apostasy but which now begins to reveal itself more probably as a nailing of an edict to the door at the mbari club the divinity at least in african concern is the same the road to redemption is different as to soyinkas charge of narcissism a preoccupation with the self is occupational with the poet and as soyinka himself agreed what otherwise might probably be termed narcissism is a frequent and likely form of affirmation in a literature of exploration and of rediscovery walt whitman could reasonably be considered vainglorious as he celebrates in himself a new universe of concern langston hughes insists that he too is beautiful and that he will too sit down at the welcome table as he pushes back limiting american horizons the poetry of irelands cultural rebirth contained what could be termed its own imaginative narcissism selfglorification can serve a purpose someone remarked that thousands of persons since nobody knows my name will never again look down at the dark face of a negro boy without for a second wondering whether the keen intelligence of a james baldwin is returning that gaze it is true that senghor is much concerned with senghor but in thrusting himself upon the world he has to a degree changed that world soyinka quotes the following passages from senghor characterizing them as deceptive claiming that under the guise of glorifying man and poet and of exploring the nature of poetry he is in reality paying increasingly ecstatic tribute to himself in a sequence of static communal concretions am not the rhythm it holds me still it carves all my body like a statue of baule it must be admitted however despite soyinka that both passages display a compelling lyric beauty and serve an esthetic purpose evident within the context of the poems in their entirety it is also apparent on the face of them that they aid in the labor of rediscovery they speak to the lines of david diop hey boy a chair a napkin a drink le temps du martyr it is curiousfrom the victim of the colonial experience would normally be expected a reaction of bitterness and resentment here the contrary seems to be the case it is soyinka who is lacerating in his mood not we have seen against the european but adventitiously in regard to any or all who might fall under his critical gazewithout regard to race creed or continental origin this corrosive strain does not mean soyinka is without humor some of the scenes in the trials of brother jethro and the lion and the jewel are hilarious even in the serious dance of the forests we have the old mans interesting and homely advice if the guest wont go quietly we must shout out the price of food but there is in these plays as in his others a caustic overview a ready corrosive wit swift to obey the playwrights ranging inclination to thrust and cut to the quick it is an effective talent adding sharpness and excitement even if it may impede in another dimension senghor of course is not witless his poetry simply lacks wit this is not to gainsay an extraordinary intellectual capacity and a rare ingenuity of argument evident in both his poetry and his prose wit borders on the cruel and excels in giving pain senghor evinces no such inclination this absence moreover is of a piece with the public and solemn character of his creative work addressed as it is not to the interior experience of the individual but in its essentially declamatory manner to europe and to mon peuple noir as anyone concerned with the public mood is aware intellectual agility is not the tool to touch the wellsprings of the collective will whether by conscious design or by virtue of the nature of his talent senghors work observes this restriction this particular contrast in the work of the two writers bears a relation to what is probably the most crucial area of comparison between the two as we have seen soyinka accuses senghor of making resounding and narcissistic public utterances celebrating and calling for what he senghor is unable to achieve to make manifest the true african sensibility the charge makes crucial obviously the nature of the poetic heritage of which soyinka speaks he appears to find it at root in the animist concept of the universe there is no rigid distinction between matter and spirit matter is infused with spirit and existence is a continuum of spirit inherent in an endless variety of material forms the african poetic labor is to transcend the superficial division and by and through the word to breach the threshold of that merger of spirit and matter wherein diversity becomes one there are similarities here of course with other cultures and the concept is reminiscent in the esthetic world of the more ambitious hopes of the fauves among the painters and earlier in the latter half of the nineteenth century the symbolist poets in france it is true however that while europe upon occasion has arrived at this point in its esthetic hadj it appears to have been inherent in the african vision since its remote and obscure origins it does appear to be accurate to say that senghors avowed and declamatory return to african traditions is in a sense a staking of a claim stopping short of its more profound exploitation he acclaims the rediscovery of the african genius he renounces the cramping tutelage of europe he invokes the tribal totems and in eloquent praise poems celebrates the old gods and the old customs however having conjured upand brilliantlythe african presence he does not complete the task it is left to others to work the mine field which he has opened and proclaimed senghors work which has been a pioneer labor is to wrest recognition of a valid african experience from the hostile soil of western imperialism this concern is foremost throughout his first three volumes chants dombre h os ties noires and chants pour naett it is present still in ethiopiques as more confidently he speaks as the representative of his reclaimed people at the same time however his tone is becoming ambivalent and like armattoe of the gold coast for the first time he perceives and laments defects in his hitherto idealized homeland and confesses his need for the brilliance and beauty of europe i have need of the maytime murmuring at montsouris of the splendour of the tuileries at the end of summer epitre a la princesse v in the same poem he finds he must lament in his letter to his princess of belborg that the land of my mother is not a noble land yes i know it is not a noble land for it belongs to the third day half water half earth my nobleness princess is to live that land according to that land one is reminded in a reverse parallel of how gauguin in a last painting as death approached in tropical tahiti created an utterly nostalgic portrayal of the snowcovered town in the france of his youth senghors poetic need has gone full cycle from the shifting vision sartre described in orphee noir in in which the pole pull of african desire had moved from kamchatka and the capitols of europe to the sundrenched cities of africa and again in nocturnes senghor has gone a step beyond not however toward an exploration of the african tradition he has acclaimed but into a personal meditative examination of the nature of poetry and other questions upon which he is reflecting soyinkas work provides a fruitful contrast nowhere does he engage in a similar nostalgic and idealized invocation of historic africa there is no tribute to africas past glory things african appear to find no more worthy an assessment in his caustic lexicon than europe or any other spot on the benighted globe the characters of his plays curse evenly both europe and africa past as well as present in both the road and a dance of the forests for example we are made aware of the horror of motor travel obaneji in the latter remarks another passenger lorry they call it the incinerator of the seventy people in it five escaped it overturned you see and the body was built of wood we learn the extended family institution is a decided nuisance rola this whole family business sickens me a pack of dirty yelling grandmas and fleabitten children in the swamp dwellers we see that agrarian life is burdensome and primitive riddled with fraud but flight to the city lagos results only in personal disintegration in the lion and the jewel soyinka derides both the old and the new while in the strong breed though working seriously to explore tribal traditions he implicitly makes the severest criticism of its inadequacies particularly in a dance of the forests do we learn that africas vaunted past is tyranny adenebi the accumulated heritage that is what we are celebrating mali chaka songhai glory empires but you cannot feel it can you and the scorned queen of medieval africa madame tortoise who has a special punishment for her disobedient warrior guards pay close attention to my words do eunuchs not fetch a good price at the market guard madame woman the victims wife have pity have pity madame tortoise to the warrior you are lost but have your wish warriors are sold as men but eunuchs guard the harems of other mata kharibus drooling on wares they cannot taste choose and the bereaved wife eight centuries later my knowledge is the hate alone the little ball of hate alone consumed me was it for this for this children plagued their mothers and the historian we were so near to the greatness of troy and greece mean this is war as it should be fought over nothing do you not agree these plays force our awareness that as suggested soyinka is doing what senghor is not he is working with the materials and in the context of the traditional africanframework to explore the fundamental questions of his society and more deeply of existence not that he produces decipherable answers he can be said indeed to have achieved obscurity the dimly perceived cast of characters wandering murkily about in a dance of the forests clearly leaves us certainly at first with a sense of a dimly perceived cast of characters wandering murkily etc we must confess of course that we are as probably the majority of soyinkas readers ignorant of the yoruba lore crucial to fuller comprehension and also not having had an opportunity to see the plays two excepted that we have merely read them yet more significantly it is evident that the playwright particularly i n a dance strong breed and the road is seeking to come to grips with the inner reaches of reality not in terms of western values but in utilizing the resources of a unique african culture that he may not completely succeed does not diminish the merit of the effort we are reminded of faulkners appraisal of thomas wolfe as the first among american novelists not because of his accomplished work which was uneven but because of the scope of his undertaking although in the article in question soyinka addresses himself largely to mr senghor in the process he reveals his esthetic concern and states his concept of the task of the african artist he cites his countryman the poet okigbo who he feels is able to achieve the moment of imagic separation in which the poet is relieved of his personal identity and merges in awareness with his vision the african animist knowledge of the oneness of the objects of ritual and ritualism of matter and psyche is in okigbo he states achieved it becomes clear that this is soyinkas search as his play unfolds as well as his preoccupation in some of his poetry in a dance soyinka works with the materials of the animist tradition aroni the lame one is in communication with the ancestors who are invited to send representatives to the gathering of the tribes from eight centuries of death the reanimated couple emerge not the illustrious forebears hoped for but accusers as we have seen who remind the living of the shame of an ignoble past it is evident that while soyinka condemns aspects of that past along with that modern triumph the automobile he continues to work within the framework of the tradition ogun the yoruba god with both destructive and creative proclivities evokes the master carvers who pass their spirit into the wood the dead characters speak of their previous lives in the animist concept of cyclic life renewal it is in the words of ritual in a dance of the forests that the dancer uncoils the chain that leads into the dead as the dirgeman calls for space for the dead to danceand after the eightcentury flash back we hear the words of the rites of the dead the halfchild the dead woman the spirit voices of things and finally those of the colony of ants soyinka may be ambivalent about the tradition but still he is working within the area of its assumptions probably nowhere more so than in a dance of the forests in the swamp dwellers his protagonists search leads him evidently to reject both the tribal old with its superstitious frauds as well as the decadence of the urban new strong breed however reveals again the strong sense of the personal quest of the author severely critical of the inhumanity of the carrier or scapegoat tradition and yet presenting a hero who will not flee but elects to suffer under the system he condemns in the road published in soyinka moves closer toward a modern concern both in the physical setting and in the philosophic quest of the professor whose dedication to the word has animist roots but who we are informed was a lay reader in the christian church here again we are aware of the centrality of ogun in soyinkas cosmology ogun that yoruba embodiment of good and of destructiveness appears properly incarnated in the professor the master forger who is suspect of even darker misdeeds and who at the same time is the earnest seeker after enlightenment a paradoxical character cynical derisive gloomy and faithful advocate of the word in his superb essay salutation to the gut soyinka repeats in another fashion his old theme describing how even at the table the pleasurepain dialectic is the path the gourmet must travel to culinary bliss it is evident throughout his work even in the hilarious trials of brother jethro in that rakish mockery of modernity the lion and the jewel and in that tour de force salutation to the gut soyinka is engaged in a quest with his artists tools he explores the obscure trails of the animist heritage explicitly concerned with the root questions of existence in contrast senghors appears a more secular verse while he celebrates the african tradition he does not in the sense of soyinka work within it yet a curious paradox suggests itself stemming in part from the different vision of the two writers senghor in his expository prose has previously addressed himself to the subject which soyinka treats in his creative works in senghors vision the heart of the african sensibility would not be found in the unfolding riddles of soyinkas dance or his strong breed but through the rhythmic invocation of the vital force not through soyinkas knowledge not in the theme but in the style and in the manner senghor has written what is rhythm it is the architecture of being the internal dyna mism which gives it form the sys tern of waves which it emits to the attention of others the pure ex f pression of the vital force rhythm it is the vibratory shock the force which through the senses seizes us at the root of being and in the negroafrican it is in the very degree to which he envelops himself in sensuality that the rhythm illuminates the spirit senghor would thus find the african access to illumination through rhythmic utterance through an m open participative approach to other things and other beings as contrasted with what appears to be a strong cerebral inclination of soyinka whose style here seems closer to the detailed analytical proclivity of the west it is in the manner of his approach says senghor rather than in the substance of his concern that the african sensibility is manifest it is his intensely emotional and intuitive nature which is the hallmark of the african personality if senghors conceptual assumptions are correct he may be more relevantly endowed by a capricious nature than is soyinka to achieve or to inspire the african poetic vision while it is not in senghors work that sounds the great bass drum of cesaire nor mounts the crescendo of david diops rama kam yet through his poetry moves though more muted a compelling and complex rhythm which would place him within the presumed african esthetic consider for example congo femme noise in stanza ix of for koras and balafong toko waly my uncle nuit de sine prayer to the masks in these poems senghor does not in the manner soyinka cites in okigbo undertake nor succeed in cracking a mystic sound barrier but soyinka cannot fairly deny the evocatory power for example of the last lines of congo quent poem though in the tradition of his culture could be the invocation of an essentially western muse there is in senghor visavis the gods of his origins a crisis of belief the question is posed whether he calls upon the sacred powers of old for the profane purposes of a western esthetic this appears also to be soyinkas accusation and would seem to have more substance than if made for example against birago diop of the famous souffles ecoute plus souvent les choses que les etres etc on the other hand to continue with senghors concept of the african psyche it is difficult to perceive a sense of rhythmic impulse in soyinka either in his drama or in his poetry he appears largely to be almost assertively disjunctive indifferent to rhythmic order even arrogantly awkward his quotation from okigbo suggests also his approach to poetic illumination has little to do with senghors concept of rhythmic invocation the highest sense of style evident in soyinkas work is neither in his plays nor in his poetry but in his essays witness salutation to the gut and after the narcissist itself the argument could be made that the obscure and convoluted unfolding of soyinkas serious plays would in senghors distinction between the discursive analytic west and the intuitive emotional participative africa range soyinka more properly in the former category if the african is as senghor urges essentially participative seeking to install himself sympathetically in the other rather than to analyze to dissect to dominate we look with little success for evidence of soyinkas african identity there is in his works little of the generous warmly emotional quality which appears to infuse senghors poetry public and declamatory as much of it is and if there is adulation in senghor it is not exclusively of the self his praise poems are in tribute to others as well both to things and to persons in soyinkas essentially melancholy vision there is small tribute to anyonethere are few instances of genuine positive emotion of joyous fraternity of human solidarity there are perhaps one or two exceptions fatherson and sonwife in the strong breed motherson in the swamp dweller but these relationships too are doomed and gloomily overcast with tragedy more consonant with his sardonic mood are the derisive observations of the professor in the road and his own invitation to the landlady in london soyinkas lacerating wit is scarcely the model of senghors concept of the contrapuntal progression through mutual sympathy to communion and merger let us observe here that remote as we are from the subject culture of the dispute we see as through a glass and must form opinion on the artists work without benefit of confrontation with either ogun or the dyoung dyoungs of dyilor there is the further issue raised by soyinkas charge the function of art itself there is ambivalence in soyinka but his belief is clear that the african poets role is to transcend the diversity of the secular world through the intermediary of the word to know and to participate in the spirit reality immanent throughout existence in the west there is a distinction between the aesthetic and the mystic illumination it is not clear that soyinka makes this distinction senghor apparently does and for the most part his poetry does not seek to achieve what soyinka decries as its lack it does seek in the western manner a similar esthetic moment in which as bernard berenson attests substance and form merge and esthetic recognition strikes the beholder in africa however the spirits are invoked by the carver and pass into the wood senghor much as western artists employ for secular purposes the symbols of a no longer unquestioned christianity addresses himself to the masks of the ancestors with a consciousness of europe and the cultural struggle he wages for his homeland soyinkas quest keeps him on the gloomy trail of ogun as he probes the riddles of existence of the blackest part of my soul across the zebra striping r of my mind surges this desire to be suddenly white i t i wish to be acknowledged not as black but as white s e nowand this is a form of recognition that hegel had not envisagedwho but a white woman can do this for me by loving me she proves that i am worthy of white love i am loved like a white man i am a white man her love takes me onto the noble road that leads to total realization i marry white culture white beauty white whiteness when my restless hands caress those white breasts they grasp white civilization and dignity and make them mine some thirty years ago a coalblack negro in a paris bed with a maddening blonde shouted at the moment of orgasm hurrah for schoelcher when one recalls that it was victor schoelcher who persuaded the third republic to adopt the decree abolishing slavery one understands why it is necessary to elaborate somewhat on the possible aspects of relations between black men and white women it will be argued that this little tale is not authenticated but simply that it could be born and survive through the years is an indication it is no fallacy for the anecdote renews a conflict that active or dormant is always real its persistence attests to the black worlds endorsement to say it another way when a story flourishes in the heart of a folklore it is because in one way or another it expresses an aspect of the spirit of the group in analyzing je suis martiniquaise and nini we have seen how the negro woman behaves with the white man through a novel by rene maranwhich seems to be autobiographicallet us try to understand what happens when the man is black and the woman white the problem is admirably laid out for the character of jean veneuse will make it possible for us to go much more deeply into the attitude of the black man what are the terms of this problem jean veneuse is a negro born in the antilles he has lived in bordeaux for years so he is a european but he is black so he is a negro there is the conflict he does not understand his own race and the whites do not understand him and he observes the europeans in general and the french in particular not satisfied with simply ignoring the negro of the colonies repudiate the one whom they have shaped into their own image the personality of the author does not emerge quite so easily as one might wish an orphan sent to a provincial boardingschool he is compelled to spend his vacations there his friends and acquaintances scatter all over france on the slightest pretext whereas the little negro is forced into the habit of solitude so that his best friends are his books at the extreme i should say there is a certain accusatory character a certain resentment an illdisciplined aggression in the long listtoo longof traveling companions that the author offers us at the extreme say but it is exactly to the extreme that we have to go unable to be assimilated unable to pass unnoticed he consoles himself by associating with the dead or at least the absent and his associations unlike his life ignore the barriers of centuries and oceans he talks with marcus aurelius joinville pascal perez galdos rabindranath tagore if we were compelled to hang a label on jean veneuse we should have to call him an introvert others might call him a sentimentalist but a sentimentalist who is always careful to contrive a way of winning out on the level of ideas and knowledge as a matter of fact his friends and schoolmates hold him in high regard what a perpetual dreamer you know my old pal veneuse is really a character he never takes his nose out of his books except to scribble all over his notebooks but a sentimentalist who goes nonstop from singing spanish songs to translating into english shy but uneasy as well as i was leaving them i heard divrande say to him a good kid that veneusehe seems to like being sad and quiet but hes always helpful you can trust him youll see hes the kind of negro that a lot of white guys ought to be like uneasy and anxious indeed an anxious man who cannot escape his body we know from other sources that rene maran cherished an affection for andre gide it seems possible to find a resemblance between the ending of un homme pareil aux autres and that of gides strait is the gate this departure this tone of emotional pain of moral impossibility seems an echo of the story of jerome and alissa but there remains the fact that veneuse is black he is a bear who loves solitude he is a thinker and when a woman tries to start a flirtation with him he says are you trying to smoke out an old bear like me be careful my dear courage is a fine thing but youre going to get yourself talked about if you go on attracting attention this way a negro shamefulits beneath contempt associating with anybody of that race is just utterly disgracing yourself above all he wants to prove to the others that he is a man their equal but let us not be misled jean veneuse is the man who has to be convinced it is in the roots of his soul as complicated as that of any european that the doubt persists if the expression may be allowed jean veneuse is the lamb to be slaughtered let us make the effort after having quoted stendhal and mentioned the phenomenon of crystallization he declares that he love for the simplicity of the negro is a myth created by superficial observers i love clarisse i love mme coulanges and it is andree marielle whom i really love only she no one else who is andree marielle you know who she is the daughter of the poet louis marielle but now you see that this negro who has raised himself through his own intelligence and his assiduous labors to the level of the thought and the culture of europe is incapable of escaping his race andree marielle is white no solution seems possible yet association with payot gide moreas and voltaire seemed to have wiped out all that in all good faith jean veneuse believed in that culture and set himself to love this new world he had discovered and conquered for his own use what a blunder he had made arriving at maturity and going off to serve his adopted country in the land of his ancestors was enough to make him wonder whether he was not being betrayed by everything about him for the white race would not accept him as one of its own and the black virtually repudiated him jean veneuse feeling that existence is impossible for him without love proceeds to dream it into being he proceeds to dream it alive and to produce verses when the question is put directly then the white man agrees to give his sister to the blackbut on one condition you have nothing in common with real negroes you are not black you are extremely brown this procedure is quite familiar to colored students in france society refuses to consider them genuine negroes the negro is a savage whereas the student is civilized youre us coulanges tells him and if anyone thinks you are a negro he is mistaken because you merely he knows that enraged by this degrading ostracism mulattoes and negroes have only one thought from the moment they land in europe to gratify their appetite for white women the majority of them including those of lighter skin who often go to the extreme of denying both their countries and their mothers tend to marry in europe not so much out of love as for the satisfaction of being the master of a european woman and a certain tang of proud revenge enters into this and so i wonder whether in my case there is any difference from theirs whether by marrying you who are a european i may not appear to be making a show of contempt for the women of my own race and above all to be drawn on by desire for that white flesh that has been forbidden to us negroes as long as white men have ruled the world so that without my knowledge i am attempting to revenge myself on a european woman for everything that her ancestors have inflicted on mine throughout the centuries what a struggle to free himself of a purely subjective conflict i am a white man i was born in europe all my friends are white there are not eight negroes in the city where i live i think in french france is my religion i am a european do you understand i am not a negro and in order to prove it to you i as a public employee am going to show the genuine negroes the differences that separate me from them indeed read the book again and you will be convincedmonsieur veneuse has native bearers he has a young negro girl in his house and to the negroes who seem downcast that he is leaving he feels that the only thing for him to say is please go away please go away you see how unhappy it makes me to leave you please go now i will not forget you i am leaving you only because this is not my country and i feel too alone here too empty too deprived of all the comfort that i need but that you luckily for you do not yet require when we read such passages we cannot help thinking of felix eboue unquestionably a negro who saw his duty quite differently in the same circumstances jean veneuse is not a negro and does not wish to be a negro and yet without his knowledge a gulf has been created there is something indefinable irreversible there is indeed the that within of harold rosenberg louist achille said in his report to the international conferences of insofar as truly interracial marriage is concerned one can legitimately wonder to what extent it may not represent for the colored spouse a kind of subjective consecration to wiping out in himself and in his own mind the color prejudice from which he has suffered so long it would be interesting to investigate this in a given number of cases and perhaps to seek in this clouded motivation the underlying reason for certain interracial marriages entered into outside the normal conditions of a happy household some men or some women in effect by choosing partners of another race marry persons of a class or a culture inferior to their own whom they would not have chosen as spouses in their own race and whose chief asset seems to be the assurance that the partner will achieve denaturalization and to use a loathsome word deracialization among certain people of color the fact that they are marrying someone of the white race seems to have overridden every other consideration in this fact they find access to complete equality with that illustrious race the master of the world the ruler of the peoples of color w we know historically that the negro guilty of lying with a white woman is castrated the negro who has had a white woman makes himself taboo to his fellows it is easy for the mind to formulate this drama of sexual preoccupation and that is exactly the ultimate goal of the archetype of uncle remus brer rabbit who represents the black man will he or will he not succeed in going to bed with the two daughters of mrs meadows there are ups and downs all told by a laughing goodnatured easygoing negro a negro who serves with a smile during the time when i was slowly being jolted alive into puberty i had the honor of being able to look in wonder on one of my older friends who had just come back from france and who had held a parisian girl in his arms i shall try to analyze this problem in a special chapter talking recently with several antilleans i found that the dominant concern among those arriving in france was to go to bed with a white woman as soon as their ships docked in le havre they were off to the houses once this ritual of initiation into authentic manhood had been fulfilled they took the train for paris but what is important here is to examine jean veneuse to this end i shall resort in considerable measure to a study by germaine guex la nevrose dabandon contrasting what she calls the abandonment neurosis which is preoedipal in nature to the real postoedipal conflicts described by orthodox freudians dr guex analyzes two types the first of which seems to illustrate the plight of jean veneuse it is this tripodthe anguish created by every abandonment the aggression to which it gives rise and the devaluation of self that flows out of itthat supports the whole symptomatology of this neurosis we made an introvert of jean veneuse we know characterologically or better phenomenologicallythat autistic thinking can be made dependent on a primary introversion me for the white race would not accept me as one of its own and the black virtually repudiated me that is precisely my position the attitude is one of recrimination toward the past devaluation of self incapability of being understood as he would like to be listen again to jean veneuse who can describe the desperation of the little hottentots whose parents in the hope of making real frenchmen of them transplant them to france too early from one day to the next they are locked into boarding schools these free joyful children for your own good as their weeping parents tell them i was one of these intermittent orphans and i shall suffer for it throughout my life at the age of seven i and my introduction to learning were turned over to a gloomy school far out in the country the thousand games that are supposed to enliven childhood and adolescence could not make me forget how painful mine were it is to this schooling that my character owes its inner melancholy and that fear of social contact that today inhibits even my slightest impulses m and yet he would have liked to be surrounded enclosed he did not like to be abandoned when school vacations came all the other boys went home alonenote that word alonehe remained in the big empty white school oh those tears of a child who had no one to wipe them he will never forget that he was apprenticed so young to loneliness a cloistered existence a withdrawn secluded existence in which i learned too soon to meditate and to reflect a solitary life that in the end was profoundly moved by triflesit has made me hypersensitive within myself incapable of externalizing my joys or my sorrows so that i reject everything that i love and i turn my back in spite of myself on everything that attracts me what is going on here two processes i do not want to be loved why not because once very long ago i attempted an object relation and i was abandoned i have never forgiven my mother because i was abandoned i will make someone else suffer and desertion by me will be the direct expression of my need for revenge i will go to africa i do not wish to be loved and i will flee from loveobjects that germaine guex says is called putting oneself to the proof in order to prove something i do not wish to be loved i adopt a defensive position and if the loveobject insists i will say plainly i do not wish to be loved devaluation of self indeed yes quences for one thing it keeps the individual in a state of profound inner insecurity as a result of which it inhibits or falsifies every relation with others it is as something that has the right to arouse sympathy or love that the individual is uncertain of himself the lack of affective selfvaluation is to be found only in persons who in their early childhood suffered from a lack of love and understanding jean veneuse would like to be a man like the rest but he knows that this position is a false one he is a beggar he looks for appeasement for permission in the white mans eyes for to him there is the other affective selfrejection invariably brings the abandonmentneurotic to an extremely painful and obsessive feeling of exclusion of having no place anywhere of being superfluous everywhere in an affective sense i am the other is an expression that i have heard time and again in the language of the abandonmentneurotic to be the other is to feel that one is always in a shaky position to be always on guard ready to be rejected and unconsciously doing everything needed to bring about exactly this catastrophe it would be impossible to overestimate the intensity of the suffering that accompanies such desertion states a suffering that in one way is connected to the first experiences of rejection in childhood and that brings them back in all their strength the abandonmentneurotic demands proofs he is not satisfied with isolated statements he has no confidence before he forms an objective relation he exacts repeated proofs from his partner the essence of his attitude is not to love in order to avoid being abandoned the abandonmentneurotic is insatiable that is because he claims the right to constant amends he wants to be loved completely absolutely and forever listen he is needed he is loved and yet what fantasies does she really love me does she look at me objectively one day a man came a great friend of daddy ned who had never seen pontaponte he came from bordeaux but good god he was dirty god how ugly he was this man who was such a good friend of daddy ned he had a hideous black face completely black which showed that he must not wash very often looking eagerly for external reasons for his cinderella complex jean veneuse projects the entire arsenal of racial stereotypes onto a child of three or four years and to andree he says tell me andree darling in spite of my color would you agree to marry me if i asked you he is frightfully full of doubt here is germaine guex on that subject the first characteristic seems to be the dread of showing oneself as one actually is this is a broad field of various fears fear of disappointing fear of displeasing of boring of wearying and consequently of losing the chance to create a bond of sympathy with others or if this bond does exist of doing damage to it the abandonmentneurotic doubts whether he can be loved as he is for he has had the cruel experience of being abandoned when he offered himself to the tenderness of others as a little child and hence without artifice jean veneuse does not however lead a life devoid of compensations he flirts with art his reading list is impressive his essay on suares is quite perceptive that too is analyzed by germaine guex imprisoned in himself locked into his artificial reserve the negativeaggressive feeds his feeling of irreparable loss with everything that he continues to lose or that his passivity makes him lack therefore with the exception of such privileged sectors as his intellectual life or his profession he cherishes a deepseated feeling of worthlessness where does this analysis lead us to nothing short of proving to jean veneuse that in fact he is not like the rest making people ashamed of their existence jeanpaul sartre said yes teaching them to become aware of the potentials they have forbidden themselves of the passivity they have paraded in just those situations in which what is needed is to hold oneself like a sliver to the heart of the world to interrupt if necessary the rhythm of the world to upset if necessary the chain of command but in any case and most assuredly to stand up to the world jean veneuse is the crusader of the inner life when he sees andree again when he is face to face with this woman whom he has wanted for months and months he takes refuge in silence the eloquent silence of those who know the artificiality of words and acts jean veneuse is a neurotic and his color is only an attempt to explain his psychic structure if this objective difference had not existed he would have manufactured it out of nothing jean veneuse is one of those intellectuals who try to take a position solely on the level of ideas incapable of realizing any concrete contact with his fellow man is he treated decently kindly humanly only because he has stumbled on some servant secrets he knows those people and he is on guard against them my vigilance if one can call it that is a safetycatch politely and artlessly i welcome the advances that are made to me i accept and repay the drinks that are bought for me i take part in the little social games that are played on deck but i do not allow myself to be taken in by the good will shown me suspicious as i am of this excessive cordiality that has rather too quickly taken the place of the hostility in the midst of which they formerly tried to isolate me he accepts the drinks but he buys others in return he does not wish to be obligated to anyone for if he does not buy back he is a nigger as ungrateful as all the others is someone mean it is simply because he is a nigger for it is impossible not to despise him well it is clear to me that jean veneuse alias rene maran is neither more nor less than a black abandonmentneurotic and he is put back into his place his proper place he is a neurotic who needs to be emancipated from his infantile fantasies and i contend that jean veneuse represents not an example of blackwhite relations but a certain mode of behavior in a neurotic who by coincidence is black so the purpose of our study becomes more precise to enable the man of color to understand through specific examples the psychological elements that can alienate his fellow negroes i will emphasize this further in the chapter devoted to phenomenological description but let us remember that our purpose is to make possible a healthy encounter between black and white jean veneuse is ugly he is black what more is needed if one rereads the various observations of germaine guex one will be convinced by the evidence un homme pareil aux autres is a sham an at tempt to make the relations between two races dependent on an organic unhealthiness there can be no argument in the domain of psychoanalysis as in that of philosophy the organic or constitutional is a myth only for him who can go beyond it if from a heuristic point of view one must totally deny the existence of the organic the fact remains and we can do nothing about it that some individuals make every effort to fit into preestablished categories or rather yes we can do something about it earlier i referred to jacques lacan it was not by accident in his thesis presented in he violently attacked the idea of the constitutional apparently i am departing from his conclusions but my dissent will be understood when one recalls that for the idea of the constitutional as it is understood by the french school i am substituting that of structureembracing unconscious psychic life as we are able to know it in part especially in the form of repression and inhibition insofar as these elements take an active part in the organization peculiar to each psychic individuality as we have seen on examination jean veneuse displays the structure of an abandonmentneurotic of the negativeaggressive type one can attempt to explain this reactionallythat is through the interaction of person and enviromentand prescribe for example a new environment a change of air it will properly be observed that in this case the structure has remained constant the change of air that jean veneuse prescribed for himself was not undertaken in order to find himself as a man he did not have as his purpose the formulation of a healthy outlook on the world he had no striving toward the productiveness that is characteristic of psychosocial equilibrium but sought rather to corroborate his externalizing neurosis the neurotic structure of an individual is simply the elaboration the formation the eruption within the ego of conflictual clusters arising in part out of the environment and in part out of the purely personal way in which that individual reacts to these influences just as there was a touch of fraud in trying to deduce from the behavior of nini and mayotte capecia a general law of the behavior of the black woman with the white man there would be a similar lack of objectivity i believe in trying to extend the attitude of veneuse to the man of color as such and i should like to think that i have discouraged any endeavors to connect the defeats of jean veneuse with the greater or lesser concentration of melanin in his epidermis this sexual myththe quest for white fleshperpetuated by alienated psyches must no longer be allowed to impede active understandingin no way should my color be regarded as a flaw from the moment the negro accepts the separation imposed by the european he has no further respite and is it not understandable that thenceforward he will try to elevate himself to the white mans level to elevate himself in the range of colors to which he attributes a kind of hierarchy we shall see that another solution is possible it implies a restructuring of the world russell payton leaned r y his shovel against the side of the grave he stretched his body and pressed the palms of his hands against the lower part of his back the sun directly overv n f n v m v head beat down on his shoulders pushing his hat to the back of his head he daubed his wet forehead with an already sodden handkerchief and stood for a moment squinting up out of the hole at the bluewhite september sky a hawk circled high in the air then glided out of sight from a nearby cornfield he heard an insistent bobwhite bobwhite as his lips puckered to whistle an answer to the bird a dragonfly darted down into the grave whirred around him then lighted atop a mound of the fresh red dirt its transparent wings fluttering and shimmering in the sun he snatched up a clod of dirt and flung it at the dragonfly mumbling is everything okay mr snake doctorsir does all this suit you turning he picked up his shovel and measured the length of the grave then used his own six foot frame to judge the graves height the edges were well over his head he grunted in satisfaction tossed the shovel up out of the grave then scrambled out himself he laid the shovel across his shoulder and tramped down the hillside to where his old ford pickup truck was parked alongside the dirt road as he guided his truck onto the road he glanced back up the hillside at the patch of gray crooked tombstones and the one dark gaping hole surrounded by piles of red clay the sign hanging over the baggage platform of the grimy gray and black ic railroad station proclaimed winnesoga miss pop as russell payton shifted his truck into reverse and backed it up to the platform three ancient black men smoking and lounging on the empty railway express wagon got slowly to their feet and slouched over to the edge of the platform one of the ancients taking his pipe from his mouth said hidee russ hidee todays the day aint it russell payton slammed the door of his truck and jumped up on the platform howdy mr lucius howdy yawll yeah todays the day is the twelvethirtyfive on time yep shes on time all right lucius said proudly just checked with mr lasley at the window a little while ago he ceremoniously extracted a large watch from the bib pocket of his overalls and peered at it she should be coming round the curve yonder in about fifteen minutes russell nodded and lifted his hand to the men then crossed the platform and entered the door of the station marked colored he paused in the doorway letting his eyes adjust to the dimness of the small room the four highbacked benches facing the fat unfired stove and the six stools at the little lunch counter in the far corner were empty in the center of the floor a brownstained spittoon was being explored by a dozen flies overhead the ceiling fan hummed lazily and from beyond the ticket window the cricket like clicks of the telegraph keys unsettled the quietness he crossed to the lunch counter slid onto a stool and pressed the little bell atop the counter hello russ howre things going with you i was hoping youd stop in before train time russell looked up at a dark brown skinned woman wearing a starched blue dress and a small white apron who had come out of the adjacent kitchen he was suddenly conscious of the sweat and dirt that streaked his clothes and face he smiled diffidently im okay mae he said howre you the woman lowered her eyes and shrugged her shoulders she began to wipe the counter and to adjust the salt and pepper shakers can i get you anything russ pepsi the woman returned with the drink placed it in front of russell and began to wipe the counter again suddenly she stopped and leaned across the counter the tips of her fingers touching russs arm her wide dark eyes were moist russ i know your mama and billy joe are bringing t g home today and i want to come to the funeral i know your mama partly blames me for t g leaving and she and she probably wont appreciate me comingbut i want to see him russ i want to see his face again before they put him in the ground what do you think huh think your mama raise cain if i come russell curled his fingers around the cold bottle lifted it to his mouth and took a long swallow in the first place mae aint no body gonna see tgs face he said the box aint gonna be opened but why not russell raised his voice slightly have you ever seen anybody after theyve been electrocuted well no me neither but i read about it and it aint pretty i mean when they burn you they burn you and then they just embalm you and lay you in a wooden box to be buried by the state if anybody dont claim your body and we barely scraped together enough money to bring tg home aint none left to lay him out fancy so aint nobody gonna see him as he firmly set the drink down he felt the womans fingers tighten on his arm she said even so russ i still want to come but what about miz payton when she and billy joe caught the train here last monday she barely spoke to me he said itll be okay to come tomorrow mae mama aint gonna say nothingbe too many people around and well hell everybody know tg left here cause the law was after him and not on account of you and the boy yeah but he got into that fight with the sheriff cause he was drunk and he got drunk cause i told him i was pregnant and he thought i was trying to force him russell saw a tear trembling in the corner of her eye and said quickly how is the boy mae the woman brightened she flashed a quick smile exposing white teeth and sending the tear weaving down her cheek oh hes finehes fine he started in school this year you know dont seem like its been that long since tg left i betcha hes growed a foot since you last saw him russ billy joe comes to see him and me all the time why dont you well mae you know how it is been working a bell tinkled behind the woman from beyond the swinging door of the kitchen she raised up off the counter looked over her shoulder then back at russ be back in a minute she said smiling an apology you know how it is when the white folks call us niggers gotta come as she disappeared through the door russ glimpsed a row of white faces at the lunch counter in the white waiting room he picked up his drink turned on his stool and leaned back against the counter when the white folks call us niggers gotta come he rubbed the cold bottle against his face and chuckled not tg he thought not highstepping loudlaughing tg crap tg wouldnt come even when his own daddy called not even when his own daddy lay dying and calling for him a little over two years ago russell shifted the cold bottle to the other side of his face and stared out through the dirty flyspecked window at twin steel tracks remembering how they had whined underneath him as they sped him to chicago to find tg and bring him back to his daddy he was tired and short tempered when he knocked on tgs door the train ride to chicago had been long and the elevated ride to the south side confusing he didnt like the hard noisy chicago night he didnt like the dim cluttered foulsmelling hallway in which he was now standing he didnt like having to leave home while his daddy lay dying he pounded on tgs door okayokay hold tight im coming the door inched open a cautious eye peered out from the darkness yeah who is it its me tg open the damn door the eye blinked then widened and the door swung open russ russ whatre you doing here man come in come in russ moved past tg into the middle of the room stopped and turned extending his hand toward tg in the dimness he saw tg keeping his right hand concealed behind him quickly edge along the wall to a bureau in the corner of the room he heard a heavy thud as he saw tg lean against an open drawer then close it turn on your lights tg russ said what the hells the matter with you tg clicked on the lights dressed only in his underwear and barefooted he advanced and stuck out his hand they embraced awkwardly and stepped back smiling sheepishly at each other russ looked at his brother at the receding hairline and the whiskeyreddened eyes at the wide mouth now curling upwards in a grin at the tall underfed looking body that now shifted nervously in the center of the room and anger welled up in him he clamped his teeth together and jerked his eyes away from his brother and looked around the room they swept past the bare wall and single chair past the bureau lined with whiskey and wine bottles and halted at the bed where a woman huddled under a blanket her hair in disarray her eyes heavy with sleep tg looked from russs face to the bed and laughed he waved russ to the chair and said wait a minute brer ill get rid of her and then well talk he crossed to the bed and shook the woman roughly cmon get up he said go somewhere and come back later me and my brers gotta talk what is this the woman said what the hell russ said let it go tg we can go someplace else oooh no tg laughed shes getting up and getting out of here he reached for the blanket that the woman clutched under her chin russ stood up quickly and turned his back to the bed trying to ignore the torrent of hot words flowing between tg and the woman he wandered over to the bureau picked up a bottle of whisky tumbled some into a glass and took a swallow attracted by a flicker of light he glanced downward in an almost closed drawer he saw a silver plated pistol glinting coldly and menacingly on a pile of rumpled shirts like a coiled rattler sunning on a pile of rocks a chill swept over him and he felt the muscles tighten across his shoulders he twirled the glass in his hands his mind conjuring up fearful pictures of tg and the gun he was unaware that the woman had slipped out of the room until he heard tgs laughterfilled voice he wheeled around and said cmon tg pack your stuff were going home tg flopped across the bed laughing now hold tight brer i aint going noplace whatre you talking about anyway didnt you get my letter naw well i wrote and told you to come home right away daddys hurt tg he was plowing for mr campbell and fell off the tractor hes well the doctor says he wont last long and he wants to see you so cmon start packingtg rose from the bed and crossed to the bureau he picked up a bottle of whiskey tilted it to his lips and took the bottle back to the bed with him tell me russ he said hows mama and billy joe theyre all okay and mae and your little boy is too now lets go we can talk about em on the way home tg took a long drink from the bottle and laid back across the bed with the bottle resting on his bare chest he stared up at the ceiling and said softly that mae shes okay i guess shes pretty mad at me huh i guess shes pretty mad at me about the baby and everything huh he made circles on his chest with the bottle russ stood up abruptly cmon man i told you wed talk about it later cant you understand daddys dying he might even be dead already brer you know i cant go back down there what about that sonnuvabitching sheriff i beat the hell out of uhuh not me i aint fixing to go to nobodys jail never daddy got the sheriff to drop that warrant on you over a year ago i told you about it in the letter tg laughed you think id trust that sheriff you think hes gonna forget about that whipping this nigger gave him uhuh brer i aint going he raised the bottle to his lips again youre going all right even if i have to drag you russ said he strode across the room to the partly open door of a closet and flung it open he rummaged in the darkness and found a battered suitcase hurling it into the center of the room he began to jerk clothes from the racks he stalked back into the room and pitched the clothes on the bed start getting dressed he ordered tg sat up on the bed didnt you hear me man i told you i aint going whats the matter with you tg russ shouted taking a step toward tg and fighting down his anger stop acting like a fool whats the matter with you suddenly tg scooted back to the middle of the bed and stood up his feet disappearing in the softness of the mattress his laughter bouncing off the walls the bed springs protested at the sharp weight and for a second he reeled on his unsteady foundation his bare chest heaving his bare legs trembling gripping his shorts with one hand he pointed the whiskey bottle at russ with the other whats the matter with me well ill tell you nothings the matter with me nothing the whole thing is nothing me wanting to see daddy aint nothing him wanting to see me aint nothing him dying aint nothing home aint nothing mama and billy joe and mae and the boy aint nothing he took a tottering step to the edge of the bed and bent over resting his palms on his knees he shoved his face into russs and said you know why aint nothing nothing brer cause i aint nothing and you aint nothing and russ slapped him hard tg fell back across the bed the whiskey bottle spinning out of his hand and crashing on the floor as russ grabbed for him tg twisted out of his reach and bolted for the bureau he jerked the the drawer open and whirled with the pistol glinting coldly in his hand as russs fist cracked against his jaw sending him crumbling to the floor russ stooped over and picked up the gun then went to the chair and sat down breathing heavily limply holding the pistol he gazed at tg trying to sort out his thoughts and stifle his anger this was tg his brother this was tg who used to make the house ring with laughter who could even tease chuckles out of his usually somberfaced mama this was tg who billy joe adored dogging his tracking all over the farm this was tg his highstepping big brother russ felt the tears streaming down his face and swiped at them with the back of his hand as he dimly watched tg struggle to his feet are you going tg he asked softly lets go home man and forget all this tg shook his head and grimly laughed as he stumbled to the bed i already done told you russ i aint going russ got up walked over to the bed and stood looking down at tg he shook his head slowly from side to side i just dont know he said i just dont know all i know is im going home he tossed the pistol down beside tg and turned starting for the door he opened the door and looked back his mouth forming a last plea tg was sitting crosslegged in the middle of the bed with the pistol stuck in the waist band of his shorts his eyebrows were arched his lips curled upwards his eyes flashed mocking sparks he said aint nothing nothing brer russ closed the door and started down the narrow hallway he had to get home he wouldnt tell them what had happened hed tell them that tg had moved and couldnt be found hey russ its just about train time she oughtta be coming round the curve anytime now bringing tg home russ smiled at the old black man who had stuck his head in the waiting room door okay mistah lucius ill be right out but he still waited at the lunch counter wanting a last word with mae who had gone to serve some white folks in the other waiting room she had been tgs girl and he wanted to assure her that it would be all right for her to come to the funeral it had been she trembling and crying who had shown him the copy of a chicago negro newspaper whose headlines shouted copkiller to die in electric chair tonight below the headlines was a picture of tg with his head thrown back and his teeth flashing russ frowned erasing the picture from his mind deciding not to wait any longer for mae he rose from the stool and went through the door out into the bright mississippi afternoon he squinted down the railroad tracks the signal light had changed from green to red a motley crowd slightly larger than that of the towns regular trainmeeters had gathered on the platform like cattle shifting in the wind they turned looking obliquely at russ he brushed ineffectually at the dirt on his clothes and moved away from the people squatting on the edge of the platform out of the corner of his eye he saw the old man lucius approaching the old man sat down beside russ with his feet dangling over the platform edge they both sat silently looking down the tracks a car with a red light on top wheeled off the street and swung into a parking space near the platform the car door opened and the sheriff got out and headed for the platform suddenly the rails began to hum and pop from around the curve the train appeared like a large red and black caterpillar steadily growing larger russ jumped down from the platform and walked around his truck he checked each tire kicking it viciously
there has never been t a free people a free country a real democracy on the face of this earth in a city of some slaves and socalled free men plato sat down and praised freedom in exquisitely elegant phrases in a colony of slaves and thousands of white indentured servants thomas jefferson a wealthy slaveowner sat down and wrote the memorable words of the declaration of independence in a country with million secondclass citizens and millions on millions of povertystricken whites woodrow wilson segregated the toilets in washington d c and went forth to make the world safe for democracy there has never been a free people a free country a real democracy in the recorded history of man the great masses of men have always lived in suburbs of hell the great masses of men and almost all women have always been anvils for the hammers of the few we have gathered therefore to talk about a subject which has no past insofar as mankind is concerned and which can have no future unless it is visualized and made concrete in the body of mankind and it seems to me that one forfeits the right to talk about freedom unless one is prepared to face that fact and to do something about it almost years ago at a time of revolutionary turbulence not unlike the present tom pane held that unpalatable tfruth up to the unseeing eyes of his contemporaries freedom he sid hath been hunted aribund the globe cd receive the fugitive and prepare in time an asylum for mankind today after a thousand evasions after a thousand proclamations and manifestoes freedom is still a fugitivein america as well as in russia in portugal as well as in angola in england as well as in rhodesia in boston as well as in mississippi we live in a world where twothirds of the people are hungry we live in a world where most of the peoples are diseased and illiterate in such a world who has the effronterywho has the gallto praise the state of freedom the whole problem of freedom in the white and nonwhite worlds must be placed first in this larger context for henceforth it will be impossible to speak of freedom in terms of the concerns of the tiny minority of men who live in europe and north america we must note moreover that freedom in western europe and north america is abstract negative and largely illusory and even in these areas millions live on the edge of despair and millions more are slaves to their skin or to their omnivorous machines it will be my argument here that the truth of freedom in the world is the truth of the truly disinherited and by that i mean that the state of freedom is most accurately reflected in the lives of the men on the bottom the men on the top and the men in the middle can remain ignorant of what they do and of what they are but the men on the bottom experience the truth of society irremediably they are the truth of every society in them we can see what we are and what we have become in the mirror of their eyes we can measure the depth of our alienation from freedom and from man to be even more explicit and to bring the matter closer to home i intend to maintain here that racism is the best index of the failure of american society to create a human and equitable society for white people my argument here is the very simple one that the depth of racism is a measure of the unfreedom in the white community and from that premise we can conclude that black men are not free because white men are not free and by all this we must understand that when the emancipation proclamation finally comes it will be most of all an emancipation of white people from the fears and frailties that cruelly twist and goad their lives before pursuing that argument let us pause for a moment and examine the meaning and implications of the word that everybody praises and few people live as we all know freedom lends itself to numerous interpretations in the white western world it is usually defined negatively as freedom from this definition finds its truth in certain abstract liberties freedom of speech freedom of association et cetera to define freedom thusly and to stop there is in my opinion a perversion of freedom for freedom also means freedom to and this positive definition finds its truth in concrete possibilities created in the social field in the right to work in the right to eat in the right to shelter in the right to be there is still another definition of freedom a psychological one which stresses the act of willing or choosing and this definition in turn is linked to a fourth one which contends that manby his ability to rise above or transcend a situation any situation by his ability to say no is the measure and the meaning of freedom in the world in my opinion no definition of freedom is adequate in todays world which does not embrace all these meaningsfreedom from freedom to transcendencein a concrete context linked to conditions that open or close real possibilities to concrete men in their social and historical situation such a definition would recognize the existentialist truth that man is freedom and would recognize that the alienation of the world from freedom is a measure of its alienation from man and the possibilities of man it would also recognize the truth that man has not yet been created and that the creation of manblack man as well as white manawaits the winning of real concrete freedom for all men here and there across the great wastelands of time little knots of men have glimpsed the terrifying possibilities of that paradox i think particularly of african village democracy and other free forms developed by american indians and other communal groups but these groups were hemmed in by material limitations and it was left to western europe to free man from feudal restrictions and to hoist high the standards of individuality and personal autonomy but europe in its lunge toward freedom made three fatal errors first of all and most important of all europe experienced its newfound freedom as the untrammelled exercise of the ego and in pursuit of the goal of possessive individualism it drew a circle around itself excluding and enslaving threefourths of mankind second out of sheer terror europe cut freedom into two parts separating man into positive and negative poles the mind and the body reason and emotion sex and the soul refusing to recognize the full force of freedom which manifests itself in sex as well as in prayer europe facilitated that manic process by which men project their rejected freedom onto the scapegoats and outcasts of society in the third place europe refused to admit the full logic of its own idea with few exceptions europeans and the sons of europeans found it difficult to extend the idea of freedom to poor whites and impossible to extend it to nonwhites in europe and in the extensions of europe freedom became a function of the skin and of property despite the huge achievements of european technology and science european freedom beautiful as it was was not freedom or better still it was not yet freedom having freed man from arbitrary restraints europe stopped halfway leaving man tied to the chains of caste class and passion having expelled man from his tribal and feudal eden europe retreated in terror from nietzsches lucid question not free from what but free for what america inherited europes immense achievements and its immense failuresand extended both the history of america like the history of europe has been a history of a magnificent evasion of the multiple meanings of freedom the most obvious example of that failure is the black american but the failure to integrate black people into the american community is only a part of our cultures general inability to create a just and human environment despite our alleged affluence to million americans many of them white live in abject poverty and millions more live lives of harrowing economic insecurity despite our extraordinary mechanical ability which cannot be praised too highly we have failed to create a truly human community machines are more real here than human beingsand vastly more important in a society of machines by machines and for machines we are increasingly powerless and a nihilistic individualism has made conformistsand cowardsof us all dehumanized depersonalized distracted by bread and television we have almost lost sight of man mystified by an ethic which confuses the verb to be with the verb to have we try to staunch the running wound of our lives by adding layers and layers of mechanical bandaids we lack passion we lack purpose and we decide nothing the great alternatives are formulated by others and in our name and without our assent men women and little children are killed in povertystricken countries increasingly irresponsible as our choices become fewer and as the world becomes more threatening we whirl around and in a materialistic inferno between collective madness and collective selfdestruction and we are afraid we are afraid of our neighbors of negroes of chinese of communists of fourletter words sex fluoridationwe are afraid in a word of ourselves because we fear ourselves and others because we are dominated by machines and things because we are not in control of our destiny we are neither happy nor free if one probes beneath the chromeplated surface senator j w fulbright says he comes inescapably to the conclusion that the american people by and large are not happy i believe that americas trouble is basically one of aimlessness at home and frustration abroad as you have probably guessed by now i believe americas trouble is at a deeper level the problem in my opinion is structural that is institutional we have not created a single community here we have not even created a single community for white people men tell me that white people ought to love black people but it is clear to me that white people dont love each other not to speak of the fact that an incredibly large number of white americans dont love themselves racism in america is a reflection of this structural problem as i have said elsewhere we misunderstand racism completely if we do not see it as a confused and alienated protest against a suffocating reality on the level of power racism is used by men to effect magical solutions of the unresolved social problems in the white community on a personal level particularly among lowerincome and middleincome whites racism is an avenue of flight a cry for help from desperate men stifling in the prisons of their skins viewed in this perspective racism is a flight from freedom a flight from the self a flight from the intolerable burdens of being a man in a mechanized world there is considerable evidence that americas stress on possessive individualism induces exaggerated anxieties which are displaced onto the area of race relations the fear of failure the fear of competitors the fear of losing status of not living in the right neighborhood of not having the right friends or the right gadgets these fears weigh heavily on the minds of millions of americans and lead to a search for avenues on the escape and so the factory worker or the poor farmer who finds himself at a dead end with a nagging wife a problem child and a pastdue bill uses the black man as a screen to hide himself from himself and from an intolerable reality to adapt the perceptive words of richard wright social discontent assumes many guises and the social commentator who focuses on the police blotter misses the real clues to contemporary reality by this i mean that it is possible to know before it happens that certain forms of violence will occur it can be known before it happens that a native bom american educated healthy with a pretty wife a splitlevel house and two cars with all the abstract liberties but devoid of basic human satisfactions will seize upon a powerless black man and derive deep feelings of pleasure from hacking him to death with a chain but as wright said to know that a seemingly normal ordinary american is capable of such brutality implies making a judgment about the nature and quality of our everyday american experiences which most americans simply cannot do for to admit that our individual experiences are of so low a quality as to preclude the deep organic satisfactions necessary for civilized peaceful living is to condemn the system that provides those experiences the real question in america is how we build a society in which apparently normal people do not need scapegoats or whipping boys to build their egos and to maintain their dignity how can we build a society that will enhance freedom and integrity and obviate the need for racism first of all we have to condemn the system and we have to condemn the system in the name of that america of that commonwealth of silence which was written which was promised and which has never existed i am suggesting here that we must initiate a sustained dialogue on the foundations of our society and we must demand the right to subject every institution to the claims of freedom let me say immediately that i dont have all the answers the only thing i know is that everything must be rethought again we need a new definition of work embracing any act of value that a man brings to society and a new definition of politics embracing the full and effective participation of all men in formulating the alternatives and choosing between the alternatives of the political economic and social decisions that affect their lives we also need a new definition of sex which would free women for equal roles in the church in labor unions in the professions and every other institution of our society i often say to my wife that women not negroes are the most brainwashed people in the western world of course in this regard i am very much like thomas jefferson i want women to have absolute freedom everywhere right nowbut i hope that the revolution starts with somebody elses wife but wherever the revolution starts i am prepared to welcome it for i believe that the future of freedom in america is dependent upon the formulation of a broader definition of freedom and of man and of woman than our society is based upon and it seems to me that it is necessary to set liberty in the context of equality with the understanding that every individual is entitled to the space and the chance to fulfill himself which is only another way of saying that every individual is entitled to the instruments that will permit him to go to the boundaries of himself this i believe is a precondition for black and white freedom in america for if we want black men and white men to cooperate we must create conditions that will make it possible for them to cooperate in other words we must change the conditions that lead white men to see black men as threats to their homes to their jobs to their masculinity and to do this we must modify the situation of the white man from top to bottom for to demand that white men give up their irrational responses to black reality is to demand that a situation which requires irrational responses be abolished we must conceive and organize in this country programs that will make it impossible for one man to profit by another mans fall we must conceive and organize in this community and in every other community programs that will relieve the economic pressures on all men so that some men will not find it to their shortterm economic interest to keep other men down in other words we must take the profit out of bigotry the first steps in this direction would be a guaranteed annual income the extension of medicare to all citizens the elimination of regressive taxes and housing and educational subsidies to lower and middleincome groups ultimately however such an effort would require a reevaluation of our dominant myths including the myth of possessive individuality which is the greatest single obstacle to individuality and the myth of property which is the greatest single obstacle to the free enjoyment of property by all men let there be no misunderstanding here i am not saying that property in itself is evilwhat im saying is that property masquerading as god is the major roadblock to freedom in the world today men need a certain amount of property to validate themselves and their freedom but freedom becomes unfreedom and life loses its meaning when property becomes an inhuman idol when anything and everything is sacrificed to an abstract thing there was an interesting article on this subject in the new york post which i would like to quote at some length the article referred to the summer marches by dr martin_luther_king jr and his supporters through the gage park area of chicago peter hamill visited the neighborhood and wrote the following words this was the way the hollywood hustlers used to put their cardboard america together in a time more innocent than ours children played in the streets or burbled from baby carriages young boys mowed lawns which still smelled sweetly from the morning rains housewives pushed strollers to the grocery stores or drove the family cars to the supermarkets a man on vacation nailed a brass numeral to his front door a lot of people seemed to be polishing automobiles with an almost reverent devotion gage park on monday afternoon seemed as innocuous as anyplace where doris day had ever lived on film but underneath past the front doors of those twostory houses in the secret places behind those lawns and those automobiles and those smiling children gage park was like a tray of summer worms by the time the thing that is crawling through gage park has hooked its last inhabitant that neighborhood is almost certainly going to murder someone it is going to murder someone because of the accident of color it is going to murder someone over the combination of wood metal and concrete which the inhabitants fondly describe as their property the same animal is crawling through the gage parks of boston and new york and california and if we dont confront it soon an unspeakably horrible disaster is going to happen here its going to happen because our churches and schools have not taught people that no thing is higher than man its going to happen because our civilization has not yet learned that men are important whether they own property or not to a great extent racism in america is grounded on the whole sick syndrome surrounding real estate status greed and human pettiness if we are serious about freedom we are going to have to come to grips with that syndrome we hear a great deal about freedom and property but we must have the courage to say that words cannot be prostituted with impunity freedom is a fine word but it has its boundaries men who say the community is free when it is enslaved men who say the sky is black when it is blue are debasing reality and preparing the way for tyranny we can respect freedom only when it is intended for freedom a freedom that denies freedom must be denied in the name of freedom for to be free is not to have the power to do anything you want to do i am oppressed if i am denied the right of free movement but i am not oppressed if i am denied the right to deny my neighbor freedom of movement beyond all that we must note that the idea of oneclass onekind neighborhoods is in and of itself a clear and present danger to american democracy the standardized neighborhoods the standardized houses the standardized minds and the standardized fears which stretch from one end of america to another is a denial of the movement of life which advances by integrating differences as chardin has said joy lies not in exclusiveness and isolation but in variety which is the reservoir of experience and emotion on the other hand uniformity sameness standardization make for cultural stagnation and as sure as night follows day regimentation and eventually neofascism in order to deal with the antidemocratic ideas which have made deep inroads in american life we must make revolutionary changes at every level of our lives we confront in a word the need for not a law here or a law there but for a vital change in the whole spirit of our civilization ah signs indicate that we are moving toward a critical point in american history the rise of the radical right the deepening despair in the ghetto the deepening fear in the white community the explicit avowals of apartheid in the recent elections all these bespeak the seriousness of the moment this is an important moment in the history of the commonwealth there stretch out before us now two roads and two roads only america must now become america or something else a fourth reich perhaps or a fourth reich of the spirit to put the matter bluntlywe must become what we say we are or give in to the secret dream that blights our hearts let us rejoice that it has come to this now that freedom is dangerous perhaps men will stop prostituting it now that freedom is exploding in broad open daylight in the streets of america and vietnam perhaps we will be able to recognize her true friends as individuals we are called upon to make a creative response to this challenge by assuming our own freedom and validating it in social acts designed to create spaces in which the seeds of freedom can grow in a very real sense the struggle in america is a struggle to free white americans or to be quite precise it is a struggle to put them in the presence of their freedom and it seems to me that it is the duty of this convocation to send abroad the good news that one can be free even in boston or chicago or new york freedom isnt something you can buy on the installment plan it is not a gift from anybodyit is a priceless possession that must be reclaimed and rewon every day as silone has said one can be free even under a dictatorship all you have to do is to struggle against it he who thinks with his own head and acts with his own heart is free he who is not afraid of his neighbors is free he who struggles for what he believes in is a free man on the other hand if you live in the richest boston suburb and if you are lazy timid conformist you are not free but a slave because men deny the tiny bit of psychological freedom at their disposal it is necessary to awaken them by social movements in which wills confront each other this is the meaning of the black revolution which is inviting us to become ourselves by going to the limits of ourselves this revolution defines the state of freedom in america today and it tells us that freedom has no future in america if the black man does not have a future in freedom more than years ago walt whitman told ralph waldo emerson master i am a man who has perfect faith but master we have not come through centuries caste heroism fables to halt in this land today the spirit of walt whitman is marching today in the harlems of our mind men and women made in whitmans image are saying to us fellow americans we have perfect faith but fellow americans we have not come through slavery segregation degradation blood cotton roaches rats to halt in this land today black americans by daring to claim their freedom are daring us to claim our own and the movement which expresses that thrust will continue despite the recent revelations of the depth and extent of racism in america whatever the problems whatever the setbacks whatever the dangers oppression must be rejected at any cost for as du bois said the price of freedom is always less than the cost of oppression in the black revolution america comes hard up against a new fact the color of the world has changed and with that change a terrifying freedom has become the burden of all men especially those men who were tyrannized for so long by the arbitrary limitations of their skin if white men come forward now to claim their own freedom and individuality if they abandon their trenches and come out into the open america will become the america that was dreamedthis is the real meaning of the black revolution which is a desperate attempt to place before our freedom the burning alternatives history is offering us walt whitman said we have not come through centuries caste fables to halt in this land today black americans are saying we have not come through slavery segregation degradation to halt in this land today and the question now is what do you say while returning from a v otorr v trip to washington revv centty i took my family to visit shasta dam j was doubtful that the s visit would provide anything of interest but the view from the top of the dam was impressive looking down the appearance of the men and machines testified to the unlimited ability of american technology in the distance the men appeared to be midgets and pipes were like strands of rope then we toured the dam and eventually reached the bottom looking up i was amazed at how little the view from the top told me about the dam what seemed small from the top appeared to be overwhelming from the bottom the pipes were not like strands of rope they were large enough for a greyhound bus to pass through from the top the bottom looked far away but rather easily reached one could always fall from the bottom the top looked even further away and impossible to reach i know now that i can never visit another dam and fully appreciate it unless i see it from the top and the bottom for anything less only provides a distorted impression of the structure education at cal the university of california at berkeley has brought me into contact with many wonderful people i would have never met had my life stopped with the menial job i thought was going to be my future many of these people feellooking down from the topthat the problems facing the negro are minute when compared with all of american progress having lived the experience of the negro i know that the problems are fantastically huge huge beyond ones ability to translate into mere words i find myself filled with an intense desire to tell people what is really happening but these efforts usually end in failure because the people have neither looked up from the bottom nor have they ever been on the bottom to see what the overall situation actually looks like the racism of america becomes apparent in this process of growing awareness americas hypocrisy becomes even more real we are taught the values the beliefs the words which are supposed to characterize america long before we have reached the age of mature criticism and when we come to an understanding of america it is not in terms of these beliefs but in terms of the practices and their implications are apparent even in the liberal confines of the university of california two of the areas where i had painful experiences with the hypocrisy and racism of america were in contact with students and administrators as a teaching assistant i spent many hours in my office talking with students they would tell me much and sometimes too much for their remarks would leave me in a rage against all that they represent a sorority member asked for a special appointment so we could discuss the term paper which she was writing in the course of our conversation she began talking about her attitude toward the girls going through rush and her basis for voting against some of them she was in the sorority for one reason it was a way to gain prestige anyone who could not add to the prestige of her sorority was going to be refused membership a negro has no prestige in america so any negro girl who came to her house during rush season would be refused it was as simple as that during the conversation she referred to the international house the residence of many foreign students as the zoo other students tell me about the schemes they use to avoid the draft graduate school letters from relatives who are also doctors faking hearing defects and the like i think of the high proportion of negroes in vietnam the high proportion of negro dead and wounded in vietnam and i realize that these people still need the negro to do their dirty work so that they can continue to lead their lives of jaded comfort cal has had good administrators but far too few of them in the spring of when i was president of the campus naacp we asked permission to invite malcolm_x to speak our application went in to the dean permission was granted and pauley ballroom was reserved for the occasion in the meantime we protested to the chancellor about an employer coming to interview in the campus placement center because we had evidence that this employer had systematically discriminated against negroes for certain positions we got no reply from the chancellor so on the morning of the employers visit a small group picketed the placement center that afternoon i received a call saying that permission for malcolm_x to speak had been rescinded because he was a religious speaker and campus facilities could not be used by such persons the next day the daily california announced bishop pike was to speak in wheeler auditorium in an attempt to salvage our program i went to the chancellors office and spoke to one of his top aides this man told me that he had issued the order to cancel malcolms appearance and he alone was responsible for the decision when i protested about bishop pike i was told that pike was a theologian but malcolm was a religious speaker it occurred to me that the man to whom i was speaking was not responsible for student affairs yet he had made the decision about student affairs i then told him i considered this to be an arbitrary decision made against us because we were negroes he turned red protesting that some of his best friends were negroes he actually said it and went on to tell me about the negro who always came to his home and played with his son i believe now and i have always believed that the cancellation of malcolm_x as a speaker was a step taken to punish us for picketing the placement center when the asuc invited malcolm_x to the campus in the fall of malcolm refused of course i was further convinced of the wholly punitive nature of the earlier action that is unless i was ready to accept the idea that in this period of time malcolm became a theologian and not a religious speaker this was my first real encounter with that monolith called the power structure and i was badly stung you look at them with their cold blue eyes and their hard faces and you realize that they have the power and you have the skin since that time i have come to a fuller understanding of how much the power structure is a replica of the racism in americanot so much in its pronouncements as in its practices throughout the university you find evidence of it negroes speak openly of it but the whites are blind to it because they have never stood at the bottom of the hill and do not know how much they reflect this racism you remember the key examples the negro secretary who was fired because she struck a white worker who called her a nigger the food services worker who was fired because he ostensibly refused to bring a note from his doctor explaining his absence from work the papers explaining his dismissal make no mention of the fact that he belonged to a religious group which did not believe in going to doctors the negro administrator who was dismissed as incompatible because he openly objected to his supervisors racial slurs another supervisor had complained that he was not submissive enough the golden bear restaurant which has never sullied its appearance with a negro waitress and of course they claim that no negroes apply negro girls admit they do not want to go through the pain of applying when they know they will not be hired we know that the personnel staff there have a practice of hiring from a waiting list of names suggested by other waitresses so it is a closed system of whites only most enraging of all the practices of the power structure are the attempts to get more negro athletes into cal for years i have talked with alumni and administrators who were interested in getting more negro athletes into cal but who expressed no interest in the negroes who were only interested in cals academic offerings these men feel that if they could draw more heavily on the negro athletes in the state then cal might once again rise to prominence in sports but the view from the bottom of the hill indicates that negroes need more educated people much more than we need athletes when these people come and express interest in the negro you soon become aware that they are not at all interested in negroes they are interested in cal sports and if they can use negroes to get to the top they will do so without offering the athletes very much anyone heard of john erby lately my reaction to these men has always been similar to my reaction to the draftdodger one young negro expressed it this way to me one afternoon in the bears lair all these cats are saying to us is to go out and find them some strong niggers that was how he felt about it then that is how i have always felt about it similar experiences take place in the classrooms you study and learn about america and in the process you learn how to analyze the situation and come to a fuller understanding of all the dimensions of americas treatment of the negro you learn how negro children are taught to dream the american dream at such early age and so effectively that by the time they come to the awareness that this dream does not include them they are unable to carry that awareness to its logical conclusion and destroy both the dream and its teacher we are even taught that this conclusion is irrational but the situation of the black man in this country is so irrational that only irrational acts will save us you learnin your objective search for truththat white america accrues gains from racism and discrimination although people use you as an example of what the negro can do you acquire objective evidence that the overwhelming majority of negroes see little change in their life conditions for example the sociologist from the university of texas who analyzed the rates at which negroes were overtaking whites in their struggle for equal treatment and then extrapolated these rates to see how long from it would take the negro to reach full equality the answer at the rates of change it would take years in education years in occupation years in income of persons and years in family income and you get angry other professors even in their attempts to be kind and helpful reflect the hypocrisy and insidious racism of this country the professors who gave their time and ability to the analysis of public school history textbooks and found that they were remiss in their treatment of the negro and other mi norities yet they do not find it possible to inaugurate a course in the history of american minorities which would help to correct a very bad situation the professor who writes an introduction to a paperback version of a classic study of the negro family but includes twice a subtle but vicious insult to negroes and you ask yourself how deep does this go can it ever end and you get angrier my experience as a negro at cal has been one of moving through an intellectual microcosm of america the experience has been pregnant with promise but the promise is dimmed by the actualities you see all around you the agonizing thing about it is that they want you to adjust to this system and become a part of it you know that both the draftdodger and the football rooter are building their comfort and ease on the shoulders of the black man shoulders which have boosted this country since but after a goal is reached they always stick a knife into the heart of the burdenbearer the negro soldier who died in vietnam but who could not be buried in the cemetery in his hometown they want you to adjust to this and help them to avoid the draft help them to find negro athletes and you know if you do this you will only perpetuate their exploitation of the people of your birth and heritage so you protest you tell them that it isnt fair and they must be much more equitable in their dealings with youeither serve with the black man or get the black man out of vietnam just as they keep themselves out of vietnam either forget about black athletes or seek black scholars as diligently as they seek black athletes and they look at you with a dumb look you arent the negro they know you dont smile at them you dont scratch your head and shuffle your feet you dont come to their dinners at the faculty club smoke their big cigars and help them develop ways to continue their exploitation of the negro not knowing how to deal with an unsubmissive negro they cancel your speakers have you dismissed from your job they make it plain that either you play their game and do so the way they want it played or you will suffer this is the agony the wretchedness of the black man who stands at the top of the hill and looks down remembering how it was to look up and knowing what it is like down there if you adjust to their evil system you will enjoy some of its fruits but they are bitter fruits for they are based on the practice of keeping other blacks at the bottom of the hill if you fight their evil system they will use their power to silence you either path is an agonizing one but if you re member the shining example of brother malcolm he was not afraid to die because he loved us so the choice is easy knowing that you will always be considered an ingrate the agony turns to rage i cheered the fsm free student movement but did not join because i have sworn to myself that if any policeman ever lays his hands on me then either he or i must die right there i have found that there were times when i longed not for more blacks on the uc football team but that the team would lose more games i remember sitting before the tv set last year and cheering each time a building in watts erupted into flames all this in an attempt to avoid the insanity that comes from adjusting to and thereby accepting americas exploitation of the black man and the uc version of that exploitation all this to avoid the insanity that comes from thinking that one has really made it as a negro when all around you are friends relatives and others the folk who will not be permitted to make it because they are negro the view from the top is so distorting and the view from the bottom so overwhelming that i wonder if america will ever conceive and undertake the steps necessary to bring full justice to the negro the more i study the more i realize how unlikely this will be so i long for even more drastic steps perhaps someday we blacks will become fully cognizant of the situation perhaps the brothers in vietnam will one day realize that they have been shooting at the wrong enemy and turn those weapons toward their true enemies perhaps the brothers in all the ghettos will one day realize that we should not just have cheered watts we should have joined them at the same time in our own cities there wouldnt be enough national guard to handle that one then the power structure will move again and we will be utterly crushed but it is more palatable than this living death brotherslet us remember malcolmit is better to die on your feet than live on your knees for nearly years a philip randolph has been a leader in the fight for full citizenship rights for black americans he is today the elder statesman of afroamerican labor leaders his credentials now read father of the historic march on washington president negro american labor council lone negro member of the executive council of aflcio international president of the brotherhood of sleeping car porters he proposed the first civil_rights march on washington in which resulted in president roosevelts famous executive order creating the presidents fair employment practice committee these accomplishments are not unrelated to his earlier years when he was a young radical with only a small number of followersand was being called by some newspapers and police authorities the most dangerous negro in the united states he was born in in a rural town near jacksonville florida at a time when the deep south was perfecting the combination of negro disfranchisement and violence which would keep white supremacy unbroken for the next years his father was a respected minister of the militant african methodist episcopal church this was young randolphs first teacher and his first exposure to radical thought the elder randolph preached to his son the subversive doctrine that race was a distinction without significancethat god himself was neither black nor whitethat a mans quality not his color was what mattered his family convinced him that education was the key to whatsoever future success he hoped for young philip and his brother attended cookman institute in jacksonville florida with tuition money they had earned themselves after finishing high school he left the south and continued his education inspired by his father with a feeling for the spoken word randolph showed an early interest in acting particularly shakespearean drama following his marriage to lucille e green former virginia school teacher in he helped organize the shakespearean society in harlem playing the roles of hamlet othello and romeo but randolphs widely admired eloquence soon took him from the dramatic stage to the leaders platform his first experience with the cause of negro labor came shortly after he left ccny and took a job with the fall river line in attempting to organize the steamship companys waiters randolph was summarily fired meanwhile he had read extensively in philosophy economics and political science developing an interest in the socialist party of eugene victor debs which he eventually joined then in under the influence of the sociologist lester ward he and chandler owen founded the messenger avowing itself the only radical magazine in america this socialist publication has been regarded by scholars as among the most brilliantly edited ventures in negro journalism in addition to militantly championing negro rights the messenger spoke out on other issues thus in while speaking in cleveland against american participation in world war i randolph was arrested and later described by the lust committee forerunner of the dies committee as the most dangerous negro in americaa charge often repeated down the years by opponents of negro rights in at the request of milton webster t t paterson and ashley totten randolph undertook leadership of the campaign to organize the brotherhood of sleeping car porters this uphill battle marked by fierce resistance from the railway companies and the vicissitudes of the depression was finally won in when the bscp won certification meanwhile in the messenger became the black worker the official publication of the sleeping car porters the brotherhood of sleeping car porters came into existence at a time when american trade unions including those in the railroad industry were losing members among other reasons for this decrease in membership was an aggressive labor policy of a large number of businesses the pullman company was experiencing a decrease in net income which alone was enough to make it more aggressive in its antiunion policies although this was an unfavorable period in which to start a labor union especially in an antiunion stronghold the porters forged ahead with their organizing activities one advantage which the brotherhood had from its beginning was that its leader was not employed by the pullman company nor had randolph ever been a porter the pullman company referred to him as an outside agitator and questioned his fitness to lead the porters in their effort to improve their lot to this question randolph referred his opponents to a decision of the united states railroad labor board which sanctioned the right of employees to choose as their representatives persons not employed by the company randolph was at this time already a keen student of labor economics and philosophy he had studied at the college of the city of new york and had lectured at the rand school of social science in new york city he had become interested in labor unions as an instrument of socialism the railroads were one of the three largest employers of negro labor in the nation almost twothirds of the railroads negro workers were laborers and the highest job to which a negro could reasonably hope to aspire was that of pullman car porter but to negroes it was a job to aspire to porters travelled saw the country served the best white society for the travelling public the sleeping car porter was part of the romance of the railroad the public didnt know of course that the major railroad brotherhoods rigidly excluded negroes from better jobs or that porters were forced to provide their own uniforms and buy the very polish with which they shined the shoes of the slumbering patron they didnt know that the porter worked a hour week and earned about nineteen cents an hour before tips randolph launched into the difficult tasks of organizing members and building public support he argued the porters case in the black worker now the official organ of the union and toured the country speaking to hundreds of audiences the pullman company which had only accepted white labor unions after a bitter struggle and a bloody strike refused to recognize a black one instead union porters began to lose their jobs filipinos and mexicans were hired to replace them the company called randolph a wildeyed uppity negro hustler who never made up a pullman berth in his life and circulated stories that he was an exploiter of his own race and a communist but randolph was a persuasive organizer by the brotherhood could claim well over half the porters and pullman maids its members constituted the largest single block of organized negro workers in industry it was a remarkable achievement in april the porters rallied around their new leader in a nearunanimous show of strength and confidence they voted to strike in order to win recognition of their union randolph didnt want a strike he was gambling and he lost the governments mediation board refused to step in other unions lent no support and the company prepared to break the strike facing the certain prospect of mass firings and the destruction of the union randolph called off the strike it took the depression and the social revolution of the new deal to unionize america pullman was forced by law to recognize any unions chosen by its employees and owing to randolphs tireless work the porters once more overwhelmingly chose the brotherhood in years to the day after he had begun the pullman car company signed its first agreement with a philip randolph of the sleeping car porters never before had a white employer signed an agreement with a negro labor leader when the national negro congress was organized in the midnineteen thirties a philip randolph became its president this militant organization was a forerunner of presentday civil_rights groups such as the congress of racial equality core and the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc the following is a quote taken from the national secretarys report on the aims of the organization in the official proceedings of the national negro congress chicago meeting february mittee which deliberated on resolutions submitted to the congress for the purpose of allowing for the maximum interchange of opinion between delegates subsessions of the congress were held dividing delegates in the morning into sections on the basis of the particular phase of the negro problem in which each was interested in addition the youth subsessions was further divided into smaller discussion groups in this way easily one half of the delegates were able to give voice to their opinions to make suggestions and to actively influence the proceedings at general sessions held in the evening invited speakers and leading delegates were heard upon important topics and the legislative measures of the congress were adopted the national negro congress was called to meet the increasingly difficult economic and social problems which face the negro people in america the need for the establishment through united action of a strong movement against the social and economic repressions being experienced by the negro made such a congress imperative while major stress at the congress was laid upon joint action by negroes themselves there remained very clearly in the minds of the delegates the need for cooperation with friendly organizations of members of other races to solve the common economic problems facing all likewise it was realized that the negro congress must exist as a federation of organizations for the purpose of pooling the strength of constituent groups in the attack upon the evils retarding the securing by the negro of his manhood rights the congress was not formed and does not exist to duplicate the work of any existing organization rather it exists to add strength and to give support to every progressive and meaningful program in aid of the negro people in their just demand for equal opportunity and complete social and economic rights the congress had no desire to exclude any group that sincerely worked for the expressed aims of the congress and any group that so worked could not be charged with unduly influencing or dominating its activity and of the constituent groups participating it can be accurately stated that none attempted such domination in his keynote address to the delegates assembled in chicago on this occasion randolph said i greet you in the spirit of the deathless courage of the th and th century black rebels and martyrs of human justice in the spirit of frederick douglass and nat turner of gabriel and denmark vesey of harriet tubman and sojourner truth those noble rebels who struck out in the dark days of slavery that negro men and women might be free we have met in times of worldwide storm and stress of social confusion economic chaos political disorder and intellectual uncertainty social institutions from the church to the family are undergoing change and instability unemployment falls like a deadening pall upon every great power and machine nation already fascist italy is on the march to subjugate the ancient kingdom of ethiopia while france and germany are in a state of truce still at bay now what of the american scene it is no less forbidding and full of contradictions unsettlement and cross currents in our social economic and political life our contemporary history is a witness to the stark fact that black america is a victim of both class and race prejudice and oppression this congress is called to attempt to meet the problems of black america the submerged tenth of the population with the advent of the second world war randolph became increasingly concerned about the exelusion of negroes from jobs in the war industries while on a southern trip with milton webster an official of the pullman porters union he conceived the idea of a massive negro march on washington he wrote the dramatic plan in the afroamerican press and agitated for it on the street corners of harlem and throughout the united states his efforts bore fruit as local march on washington committees sprung up across the country hearing of the proposed march new yorks mayor laguardia and mrs franklin d roosevelt called randolph to city hall and sought to persuade him from executing it following this meeting which failed in its purpose randolph was summoned to the white house where he met with president franklin d roosevelt and his advisors when randolph firmly reiterated his refusal to cancel the march unless negroes were guaranteed equal employment opportunities roosevelt on june issued executive order establishing the presidents committee on fair employment practices the order issued the march was called off and the national council for a permanent fepc was set up with randolph and dr alan knight chalmers as cochairmen it was not long before randolph was involved in another aspect of the struggle against job discrimination railway unions and companies had long been in collusion against the hiring of negro locomotive firemen whose difficulties became more acute with the development of diesel engines at their request randolph formed the provisional committee of firemen which initiated legal action resulting in a supreme court decision outlawing antinegro union deals with railroads in randolph won still another executive order this time from president truman testifying before the senate armed services committee randolph had indicated he would call upon negroes not to register for military duty from a harlem platform he was called to the white house by the president who shortly thereafter issued executive order establishing a committee on equality of treatment and opportunity in the armed forces meanwhile randolph had become a leading figure in the american federation of labor and when the afl merged with the cio was elected a vicepresident of the combined body and a member of its man executive councilthe only negro to hold this position within the labor movement and its conventions over the years randolph pressed the fight against all forms of discrimination and segregation largely owing to his efforts whiteonly clauses have been eliminated from the constitutions of all international unions randolph recognized however that the elimination of constitutional barriers would be only the first step toward the full integration of the negro into the house of labor and that continued pressure from negro workers would be required for further progress to organize this pressure he founded the negro american labor council and was elected its first president at its first meeting in cleveland november while the labor movement has been the focus of randolphs crusade for racial democracy his preeminence in the overall civil_rights struggle had brought him the unofficial title of dean of negro leaders and made him much sought after not only by civil_rights activists but by african leaders as well in with dr martin_luther_king jr just emerged into national leadership from the montgomery bus boycott randolph led americans in the prayer pilgrimage to washington in and he chaired two youth marches for integrated schools involving and young people respectively in the book the day they marched lerone bennett senior editor of ebony magazine gives us the following description of the historic march on washington it was the beginning of something and the ending of something it came years and days after the signing of the emancipation proclamation it came like a force of nature like a whirlwind like a flood it overwhelmed by its massiveness and finality a quarter of a million people were in it and of it and millions more watched on tv and huddled around radios there had never been anything quite like it a tv spectacular a sunday school picnic a political convention an impressive demonstration of negro unity ka visible expression of interracial brotherhood and almost unprecedented exhibition of resolve a new concept of lobbying a show of strength an outburst a call to the national conscience the mammoth march on washington was everything they said it was and more and it moved men and women as they had never been moved before the planning and execution of this massive march was the highwater mark in the long and eventful career of a philip randolph by this time the itinerant preachers son had been invited to the white house by four u s presidents back in he had accompanied the militant negro leader w monroe trotter to an interview with calvin coolidge to protest lynching and on june he was spokesman for a delegation of civil_rights leaderers who met with president eisenhower two more presidential visitswith kennedy and johnsonwere to follow but under radically different circumstances for late in in the midst of an upsurging civil_rights revolution a philip randolph called negro leaders together to map out plans for a new march on washington this time there would be no cancellation despite political pressures randolph had become convinced that a dramatic display of mass action was essential if the nation was to make progress towards full civil_rights trade unions liberals and religious groups lent unprecedented support to the plan and on august more than a quarter million americans black and white descended on the capitol in a demand for jobs and freedom as father and director of the march the largest demonstration in the history of the country randolph had forged an extraordinary unit between the negro community and its white allies and in the process renewed his unsought position as dean of negro leaders negro students and their parents are often in a dilemma when it comes to deciding for or against a negro allege or an integrated one there colleges and universities in this country that were established for and are operated primarily for negroes located primarily in the south or in border states are private and are taxsupported of the undergraduate negro students enrolled in college today slightly over twothirds are in these institutions in general negroes attend these colleges so that they can acquire lifelong friends and participate without restrictions in extracurricular activities such as fraternities and sororities also the cost of attending a negro college is considerably less than that of attending a predominately white one even so it must be realized that equal education in most instances proves to be the key to true equality to other areas of life on the american scene the predominately negro college is considered a segregated institution if it is agreed that students should be permitted to grow and learn in an integrated environment then it seems necessary to break the negro college tradition among negroes although these colleges may have integrated faculties and token numbers of white students they are still considered segregated institutions and therefore less desirable for preparing students to live in an integrated society than are interracial colleges in all fairness and objectivity the only adequate generalization one can make about negro colleges is that they are uniformly worse off then their white counterparts first their students are almost exclusively negro a fact that does not necessarily make for a weak college were all other things equal most negro students come from poor allnegro high schools which have long suffered the pangs of discrimination in the south as well as in the north thus the colleges have been forced to take the students where they are and while southern education for negroes and whites is inferior as compared to that in the north it is worse for negroes than for whites the cumulative effects of an inferior elementary and secondary education have been reflected in the type of students who enter and graduate from the negro college the student is generally bankrupt in verbal skills on national examinations he has generally scored extremely low when compared with his white counterparts this problem stems from the vicious cycle of poorly prepared negro college graduates teaching academically weak high school students who go on to inferior negro colleges the teachers the faculty in negro colleges is predominately negro a fact which in itself has nothing to do with the quality of teaching which eventuates were it not for certain builtin conditions which do contribute to poor teaching first more than twothirds of all negro college teachers graduated from segregated high schools and colleges in the south where academic standards have been shown to be considerably lower than those maintained in white schools in the same area further many would not be in teaching were it not for restrictions of segregation having not planned to enter teaching they now feel trapped and their trapped feelings create in them an indifference to their work twothirds of them indicate that they maintain low or at least flexible academic standards in their classes they enjoy a unique kind of security of not having to compete with scholars in the wider community this often means that they may occupy positions for which they are not qualified the scarcity of qualified teachers results in edds doctors of education teaching courses in history science mathematics and english there is in general an antiintellectual atmosphere on most negro college campuses however since college teaching is probably the most prestigeful occupation among negroes there is a great deal of jockeying for position in the segregated academic community serious matters often take the backseat while they engage in society activities calculated to give them added prestige in the college setting it also means that they do not have time to read attend the theatre or give thought to serious scholarly work their society orientation results in a kind of ideaphobia they allow their lives to be subsumed by trivia this is probably one of the reasons why negro college teachers rarely have time to do scholarly research and writing there are several other reasons why negro college teachers are only about half as productive academically as are their white counterparts first they are isolated from the mainstream of academic life in this country second they are generally unprepared to do worthwhile independent research and creative writing third heavy academic duties allow them little time to write their median teaching load being hours weekly fourth there are seldom funds available for research fifth few negro colleges expect their teachers to engage in research and creative writing this appears to be a result of the ideaphobia prevalent on many campuses the teacher who writes anything worthwhile may be criticized deprecated and finally ostracized as a social misfit in many cases he is asked to resign because of his radical ideas this happens not only in state universities controlled by segregationists but in private schools as well dr w e b du bois one of this centurys greatest scholars was forced to leave a private negro university shortly before he moved to ghana because of his radicalism although negroes with doctorates are few in number they are fast leaving the negro campuses for jobs in industry government and white colleges this is probably why today only per cent of the teachers at negro colleges have doctorates as compared to per cent at white institutions while the negro college teacher in general is an unhappy person usually because he although more highly educated than the general community has to suffer the indignities inherent in living in southern cities and hamlets it is the negro phd who is most unhappy educated in liberal environments of the east and the north he literally suffocates in the confines of the south the fact that most negro college presidents are autocrats is also significantly contributory to teacher unhappiness it is understandable that the greatest turnover in negro colleges is among teachers with doctorates quite the reverse of the situation in interracial institutions it is because of the phd exodus that negro colleges must rely more heavily on teaching faculty at the instructor level per cent than do white institutions per cent in general the negro college is a small institution with an average enrollment of approximately students fifty per cent of them have enrollments of less than the size poverty and lack of strong teachers cause them to restrict their curricular offerings thirty per cent of the faculty in white institutions as contrasted with per cent in negro institu tions are teaching engineering mathematics and biological and physical sciences conversely per cent of the faculty in negro colleges and only per cent in white colleges are teaching education courses english physical education and home economics further negro institutions are handicapped in the areas of physical plant housing facilities for students and faculty and library limited classroom facilities make it necessary to set up large classes limited dormitory facilities force students to live in crowded and often unwholesome conditions financial difficulties also limit the number and kinds of volumes available in their libraries in general negro college libraries leave much to be desired although the negro college has prepared the majority of todays outstanding negro leaders there is some doubt that it can meet the needs of the negro student today society has become more complex and more integrated in the last few years a negro college education is hardly adequate for the majority of negro youth this is not to say that some negro colleges are not producing in spite of the severe handicaps under which they labor topnotch students interracial colleges in the past few negro students have sought admission to interracial or allwhite colleges in many cases the cost of attending was prohibitive students felt that their backgrounds were weak and they did not wish to appear to be academically dull in the company of whites also the negro student having grown up in a segregated community and having attended an allnegro high school either in the south or in a northern ghetto felt unsure of himself and anxious around whites however there are good reasons for believing that such fears are unfounded for over years the national scholarship and service fund for negro students has assisted more than negro students enroll in interracial colleges throughout the country in kenneth b clark and lawrence plotkin under the sponsorship of nssfns made an extensive study of the success of these students of the students included in the study they found that the net dropout rate was onefourth the national average fewer than per cent of the students as compared to approximately per cent of white students do not complete college the study further indicated that negro students enrolled in predominantly white institutions of higher learning did average or better academic work thirtyone per cent achieved an average of b or better and per cent achieved c or worse for the four years enrolled slightly less than per cent graduated with honors and about one per cent were elected to phi beta kappa although the clark and plotkin study indicates that negro students in predominantly white colleges adjust socially and participate fully in the activities of college life there are still some reasons to believe that negro students segregate themselves in large college and university environments although a few students attempt to lose themselves among white students and try to deny their negroness the majority form little congoes and refuse to associate with whites outside the classroom the fact that negro students in predominantly white institutions choose to mingle with their own kind is not unusual since it is observed that indian chinese african and other likecultural groups tend to mingle more freely among themselves than they do among white american students the clark and plotkin study suggests when it reports that per cent of the negro students said that they do not read negro newspapers that attending small predominantly white liberal arts colleges tends to make negro students antinegro in their personal orientation although there may be some undesirable effects from attending a white school it is felt that the negro student will be more able to compete in an integrated society if he attends an integrated school rather than an allnegro college it has often puzzled i d me when some amer icans have approached me with the question are you a negro when it is very obvious that i do represent an unmistakable specimen of that which the anthropologist will call negroid not long ago i heard over the radio that two negroes and a canadian were captured trying to blowup the statue of liberty in new york those referred to as negroes were of course americans of african descent while the canadian was of course a canadian of french descent often referred to as frenchcanadian what actually is meant by negro in the american usage could it be a racial social economic political or cultural categorization if racially categorized the term negro as commonly used in the united states of america would seem less accurate and less scientific there are only very few people who can actually be classified as negroes in the united states the greater number of the ethnic group called negroes are stock blended of africans american indians europeans and asiatics in fact there is no pure race anywhere today in the world furthermore the phrase colored people used sometimes for negroes in america appears psychologically unwholesome as much as it is equivocal and ambiguous physical science teaches that anything visible is colored otherwise it will be invisible so that colored should be equally applicable to all varieties of mankind or races if colored means noncaucasian then it should be equally applicable to all peoples not whitesuch as the japanese indian chinese tahitian samoans etc but in america the word colored seems to be tagged to the ethnic group called negroes in this case the label does not appear to describe the goods negroism is an american creation it is an american concept not based on economic deprivation or lack of education or on cultural sterility but on white americans idea of the african type of man blackman and that mans place in the american society it is an american concept that is socially derived politically sanctioned and economically abused to the typical white american negro means a man whose entire ways of life must be fashioned in the image of the white mans before he is recognized as a human being it means a person of inferior race who should do menial jobs shine shoes or wait at tables it means a man who must lose his unique identity in a country diffused with prevailing customs of racial dichotomy many white americans both literate and illiterate have yet to overcome that irrational and unscientific notion of race that has been instilled in them through their processes of socialization that irrational notion has become a deepseated mental attitude usually externalized in different degrees of intensity in the american society it is that irrational notion that seduces many socalled white liberals into feeling that they are best qualified to solve the economic social political and psychological problems of the socalled negroesno white liberal can categorically negate the psychological connotations of negroism by posing as the friend of the negroes liberalism is not an adequate cloak for paternalism and ethnocentricism those white liberals who often pose as negro friends are the same individuals who will not invite colored students to their houses for fear of what their neighbors will say they are the same academicians who will threaten their white secretaries with employment termination because they held hands with black students on the university campus they are the same academicians who will take a jab at the academic capabilities of negro students but have failed to motivate them or demonstrate teaching excellence they are the same individuals who are always concerned about opportunities for the negroes but always make sure that other white liberals are employed first they are the same individuals who insist that negro writers must write about human beings not about negroes even though those writers have accumulated their experiences as negroes could these wellmeaning academicians be inferring that negroes are not human beings it definitely seems that there is in the present american society a growing conflict between social objectives of the people and their religious consciences this conflict has definitely tinged and affected social consciousness and democratic processes it is not necessary for the negro to be what the white americans think he should be before he can fully participate in the american society or gain recognition of his human dignity it is not at all not necessary that the negro strive to pattern his entire life and personality after the white man before he can be counted no man in the face of the world is more pathetic than that man who finds himself wedged between two cultures to neither of which he fully belongs the negro has identity which must be recognized and reckoned with the negro has a history which is unique and worth teaching in all american schools it is not necessary for the negro to lose his identity before his human dignity can be recognized and respected actually until the whites and the blacks in america mutually know and respect each other there is going to be a long and bitter struggle for universal peace and progress there must be unequivocal concessions of democratic rights social justice cultural courtesy and human dignity in america without the insidious categorizations of negroism the present negroes are no longer a people cringing and fawning but rather a people becoming more aware of their own power and potentialities a people beginning to take a pride in their marvelous achievements and ever determined to obtain a just and due treatment in a nation supposedly founded on the great ideals of freedom justice equality and respect for human personality of recent in america the black man has come to articulate the ideology of black_power many bigots racists and prejudiced individuals have distorted the ideology and equated it to racism violence and lawlessness some black americans have even joined the ranks of the biased critics and racists this is the unkindest cut of all black_power is not an ideology of hate nor of violence nor of fatalistic destruction it is rather an ideology of love and peace articulating political strength economic viability social dignity and cultural identity for the oppressed black man white power by its very nature is not analogous to black_power white power structure is viciousracially obsessed and characterized by narrowminded exclusiveness black_power on the other hand is the expression of those who know and understand the agony pain and humiliation of negroism in america it is an expression born out of the frustrations and agony of those who have been denied human rights and objective manhood in a society supposedly founded on the ideal of freedom justice and equality white power structure that has condoned social evils and the emasculation of the black man has yet to be objectively repudiated as evil and violent but yet the same supporters of that white power structure and establishment decry black_power which by its very nature speaks of love and dignity for the emasculated black man black_power does not speak of violence but of the right of selfdefense even as guaranteed in the constitution of the united states of america syllogistic reasoning should not be used to obviate the evil realities of white power structure and establishment because some who chant black_power articulate their ghetto frustrations by riot does not make black_power violent likewise because christianity was used to justify economic exploitation political strangulation and social deprivation in south africa rhodesia and other europeancolonized areas of the world does not necessarily make christianity evil and violent that the pope blessed italian soldiers before their atrocious rape of ethiopia in the third decade of the twentieth century does not make catholicism racist and violent the function of an ideology is not necessarily the acid test of its truth or falsity therefore those who denigrate the ideology of black_power should read history or look far into the sociopolitical realities of the times the ideology of black_power must become the ideology of all people who share the brotherhood of blackness this brotherhood of blackness is not a brotherhood based solely on the issue of being black it is rather a brotherhood based on the hard fact that a majority of those who have been consistently denied the right of selfdetermination human dignity and respect for human personality are the blacks and the nonwhite black_power is the symbolic call to all black people to unite and organize for the assumption of the only power that will regenerate them from the onslaught of persistent sociopolitical degradation and relentless economic deprivation and exploitation black_power is the clarion call for functional collectivization of the black masses for an ultimate assumption and sharing of economic and political power through constructive and objective programs as an ideology black_power addresses itself to an old and perennially vital question to what extent can a man determine his own destiny parenthetically it is asking the question to what extent can and should the socalled negro determine his destiny in a society with a prevailing custom of racial dichotomy in such a society identity has become a crucial issue the socalled negro because of the high degree of his physical visibility continues to face unique problems despite civil_rights laws black_power articulates the issue of identity and likens the socalled negro to a guitar string an ordinary guitar string that is unattached to a guitar may appear to be free twist one end of it and it may respond as a free string but it is not free to produce music as a guitar string is supposed to do but when it is fixed to a guitar and tightened until taut then and only then is it free to be a guitar string that will produce music black_power visualizes the socalled negro without identity without culturewithout economic and political power in america as like the guitar string unmounted a thing mute inert and without power it is saying in essence that the socalled negro with economic and political power in america will be like the guitar string mountedpossessing voice and almost a soul the guitar string however great its potentialities can never wail or produce music at will it can have no autonomy or recognition its destiny will lie in the hands of its master likewise the socalled negro may have marvellous potentialities he may have made progress in america he may have civil_rights bills passed for him but he is nowhere unless he has economic political and social power as well as a proud sense of identity such identity has nothing to do with merely being black or with the sociocultural virtues or qualities of african heritage it is an identity based on the common issues of racially buttressed economic and political oppression and subjugation in the united states of america with its prevailing custom of racial dichotomy ethnic pride or appreciation is not the same thing as ethnic or racial conceit an intelligent modification of ethnic identity and appreciation has functional importance for the perspective and objective maintenance of societal image or equilibrium black_power unequivocally articulates desegregation but not integration and assimilation in the united states for those who urge integration the big questions are integration into what or whose society integration at what price is the socalled negro an american if not why is he not if he is an american then why is he a negro and why is he walking the streets of america for over years begging for civil_rights which are already guaranteed all americans in the constitution of the united states even the displaced europeans who found refuge in america since the two world wars are already enjoying civil_rights even from the very first day they arrived in the united states yet the socalled negro who shed his blood sweat and tears in order that europe could have peace liberty and freedom is still to enjoy that same peace liberty and freedom the children of the same displaced europeans who found refuge in a merica are now the ones who spit and throw stones tomatoes eggs and insults at the children of the same socalled negroes who gave their lives blood sweat and tears to free europe from the grips of nazism and fascism what guarantees of real freedom are there for the socalled negroes in the united states with its white power structure black_power says emphatically that integration into the present american white society is not consistent with reality because this white power structure with its established system was built and is sustained through a systematic exploitation and subjugation of the black man inside and outside of the united states therefore to advocate the integration of the black man into such a system is nothing short of delusion and ethnic suicide the call of black_power is the call for functional collectivization of the black masses for their ultimate liberation and entrenchment in a position of economic and political power it is a call that urges the oppressed black masses to unite and engage in a painstaking systematic building of an organization necessary for the assumption and sharing of economic and political power in the united states black_power is an ideology that calls upon the black masses to lead and essentially finance their own organization in order to sustain that potentiality needed for action and direction ethnic pride and identity must not be sacrificed for meaningless integration no ethnic group in america subjugates its organization under the control and leadership of another ethnic group the jews lead and control jewish organizations the polishamericans control polishamerican organizations the japaneseamericans control the japaneseamerican organizations even the chineseamericans control the chineseamerican organizations it is therefore not racism if black_power urges the black man to lead and control his organizations such an advocacy is very consistent with americanism black_power operates within the framework of americanism and therefore should not be called racist and violent unless we are saying in essence that americanism is racist and violent for the black man in search of identity and power in america black_power is the ideology of the time it is the ideology that will expurgate the economic and political paralysis that emasculates and humiliates the black man in the white power structure and system in the united states black_power does not mean black isolationism or separatism but rather black unity and cooperation for a meaningful participation in the complex society of the united states of america black_power is not analogous to white supremacy neither does it mean racial polarization or dichotomization black_power means to the socalled negroes what zionism means to the jews the centralization of ethnic effort and the recognition of an ethnic fountain black_power rejects both white racialism and black chauvin m ism it merely articulates racial or ethnic coexistence on the basis of equality and respect for human personality language has in rej ti cent years been recog i i nized as a sociological factor in the life of a society both consciously and unconsciously language can influence the attitudes of a people as regards the components of their environment it has been generally overlookedhowever that language can have a decided effect in engendering racial prejudice cultural anthropology has much to say on the broad question of culture contact between the dominant and minority groups in a society and language has been delineated as an area of such contact however this delineation has been generally restricted primarily to the origin and development of language little emphasis has been placed upon the link between language patterns and race relations an examination therefore of the connection of language and prejudice towards the negro could illuminate those areas of race relations not heretofore stressed language as a potent force in our society goes beyond being merely a communicative device language not only expresses ideas and concepts but may actually shape them often the process is completely unconscious with the individual concerned unaware of the influence of the spoken or written expressions upon his thought processes language can thus become an instrument of both propaganda and indoctrination for a given idea the dominant majority in the united states has introduced the element of language in buttressing negro stereotyping it is generally accepted that such stereotyping is one of the prime contributory factors to the development of prejudice so powerful is the role of language in its imprint upon the human mind that even the minority group may begin to accept the very expressions that aid in its stereotyping thus even negroes may develop speech patterns filled with expressions leading to the strengthening of stereotypes an analysis of the symbolic meanings of some of our language components that can release the trigger of the stereotype reveals that these meanings are a force of underestimated potency in race relations the analysis that follows is admittedly a cursory review of the subject however it is hoped that it will lead to further discussion and exploration it could prove fruitful to select a number of expressions current upon our present scene in order to discern their connection with prejudice towards the negro we are here not concerned with the origins of these expressions but only with their sociological significance to modern american life dark horse this expression is commonly used to describe an individual who achieves a particular goal without a previous display of ability or social traits necessary for the achievement in a sense it connotes a development arising completely out of fortuitous circumstances unrelated to the merits of the individual concerned thus the dark horse in a presidential nominating convention is a person whose talents for political office have been unrecognizable prior to his sudden emersence as a candiw date and whose success has been completely unpredictable aside from the dramatic spectacle of a political convention the term has a similar meaning for events in everyday life the dark horse for example will get the job despite his lack of qualifications for it as used by the white majority the term becomes shrouded in concepts of inferiority it is not farfetched to suggest that these concepts are carried over to attitudes concerning darkskinned peoples in general the danger of the term lies in the idea that dark somehow or other signifies lack of ability in a particular endeavor a dark person therefore begins his ascent to a particular goal devoid of the characteristics necessary for its final achievement and only fulfills his objectives as a result of a completely unexplainable accident the effect of the expression upon a white person may be unconscious but as a symbol it can become ingrained into the mental processes and lead to the formation of stereotyped thinking black in general language use throughout the history of western civilization the word black has had a particular significance with the rise of the commercial exploitation of the peoples of africa and asia this significance has solidified into a format that evolved from the dominant socioeconomic forces of western society our own english language has carried over much of this significance and developed some of its own again even the minority group whose interests run counter to the symbolic use of this word in our culture may accept it as a part of its language patterns in the evolution of language certain components have evoked images created in the context of a culture thus the sociocultural setting in which the word black becomes a part of language can shape its symbolic as against its formal meaning in our present day culture black symbolizes evil uncleanliness defamation such usage is found in both everyday speech as well as poetic imagery this conception of evil is also found in our designation of magic as black or white with black magic connoting a greater degree of banefulness than white magic even a cursory examination of websters new collegiate dictionary reveals the existence of adverse implications attached to the word black perhaps it would be valuable to pointup these implications by listing the following sampling blackballto exclude from membership or ostracize blackbook a book containing names that are out of favor or in disgrace blackendefame or sully blackguarda person who uses scurrilous language or treats others with foul abuse blackletterunlucky inauspicious as in blackletter days blacklista list of persons regarded as suspect or as deserving of censure blackmailextortion by intimidation black dogthe spirit of illhumor or melancholy as to be under the black dog the above meanings are in addition to others of everyday usage thus black looks are defined as sullen hostile foreboding black cruelty as foully or outrageously wicked a black mark as indicating disgrace or dishonor and black market as a violation of official quotas or priorities in addition a white lie is an untruth of little importance or consequence while a black lie signifies mendacity at its worst in both dictionary and colloquial meanings black has become linkedup with all that mankind should eschew while whitein most instanceshas become the symbol of purity and goodness that we should embrace both as individuals and as a community these concepts cannot be considered accidental and undoubtedly would not exist in a society wherein whites were a minority historically these concepts have evolved as a result of the need of the dominant group to maintain social and economic relationships on the basis of inequality if its hegemony was to survive the white child in our society therefore becomes instilled with the prevailing thinking on race relations through language and this thinking is difficult to overcome once the roots of language have imbedded themselves into pliant minds the child carries into adulthood the various connotations mainly unfavorableof the word black that he has garnered through the years black sheep the term black sheep is utilized in all segments of our society to denote an individual who seems almost completely immobilized in his efforts to effect an adjustment to his environment that could result in fulfilling personal familial and community responsibilities oh hes the black sheep in our family is a common description of an individual commanding little status we might ask ourselves what would have happened if in the development of language the word white were used in describing an individual whose seeming irresponsibility society condemns our answer lies again in the relation of the word to the formation of racial stereotypes undoubtedly the white majority would not accept the infiltration of such a characterization into our language the acceptance of the term black sheep however assists in the creation of a stereotype of negro irresponsibility which has become so valuable to the advocates of prejudice black and white modern liberal and progressive movements whether in politics anthropology sociology or psychology stress the oneness of the human family this approach for example has become the basic philosophy of the united nations it is continually pointed out that human beings everywhere have the same basic needs and that variations in behavior are due to a very great extent to cultural differences social scientists generally agree that the things the peoples of the world have in common outweigh their differences the language usage of our particular society however does not seem to accept the conclusions of our social scientists in such usage black and white are considered opposites in describing personalities or events to paraphrase kipling our language patterns seem to be telling us that white is white and black is black and never the twain shall meet thus we say show it to me in black and white that is in all the different phases of the problem here we have an implication not of unity but of divergence the fostering of opposition through language can be responsible for lack of identification with the problems of minority groups the concept that the differences between peoples are greater than the similarities may become paramount at times this may not be discernible in mass movements for economic and political equality but may be revealed in the day to day relationships of negroes and whites in the large urban areas in which both groups are heavily represented language in a society does not develop apart from that societys historical economic and political evolution the interconnection of language with other forces can be best seen through its usage as a form of symbol pure language does not exist a word may have a particular meaning in a society and a totally different one in another in modem american life language has become the fulcrum of prejudice as regards negrowhite relationships its effect has been equally potent upon the overt bigot as well as the confused member of the public who is struggling to overcome conscious or unconscious hostility towards minority groups in the case of the negro language concepts have supported misconceptions and disoriented the thinking of many on the question of race and culture the concept of racial inferiority and the stereotyped thinking that accompanies it is one of the products of our current language usage described herein the entire area of semantics has been explored in recent years as it relates to propaganda of various types here however we are dealing with meanings of words that the semanticists often ignore the dictionary meanings that metamorphize into symbolic connotations because of their connection with the color of a minority group the semanticist may deal with abstract words like liberal reactionary banker or monopolist and stress that the dictionary meanings have been obliterated in a war of points of view the words dealt with in this article have infested our culture through both dictionary and pointsofview meanings they are in a sense more dangerous and more difficult to counteract than such abstractions as liberal or reactionary language is the mirror of a society reflecting its attitudes and thinking as a society changes its concepts through political action and education its language patterns may be modified thus in years to come the symbols black and white may no longer take on divergent meanings and much of the other terminology referred to in this article may become extinct in its place there may be substituted a more honest appraisal of color with a resultant favorable effect upon race relations until that time however the relationship of language to prejudice towards the negro will be of import to the social scientist working to meet the challenges arising out of the problems of race relations in present day america when douglas turner wards two short plays happy ending and day of absence opened in chicago critic glenna syse of the chicago suntimes provided a perfect illustration of both the dilemma of the negro playwright versus the white critic and of the fact that negro playwrights have no alternative but to turn to black audiences the dilemma has been dealt with by ward himself in the pages of the new york times and to some extent by addison gayle jr in negro digest january and by hoyt w fuller in african forum autumn and the progressive october but the problem of the black writer and the white critic is so important that it cannot be confronted too frequently indeed it must be dragged out again and again until finally the black writer understands the direction he must take and the black audience recognizes its responsibility to the black writer and to itself the white criticwell he will do what he has to do when he is not catered to when his opinions and his assumptions no longer have power over the black playwright but first a word about the authors two plays both plays are comedy satires with sharp jagged teeth drawing their substance and their thrust from the bittersweet reality of race relations as seen from the bottom side of the coin position then is of the essence here for it is position which ultimately draws the barrier between the playwright and the critic in happy ending two sisters maidsofallwork in the home of a rich white couple gloomily face the possibility of a divorce for their employers they are weeping and moaning at home when their young nephew a raging rascal of a militant finds them discovering the cause of their grief he launches forth into a tirade of reprimands evoking the shades of freedom now and relegating his aunts to the nether world of aunt tommies then just as he in disgust starts to leave all togged and debonair the aunts call him back and on the carpet with elaborate sarcasm the two women remind the young man that every thing he owns and enjoysfrom the clothes on his back to the thick steaks in the ice boxcomes from their rich white employers that in fact they have all been living in the lap of luxury for nine years on the largesse the white family unwittingly has bestowed upon the maids a divorce would spoil all that for it would break up the white family and force the aunts to find new jobs realizing all this the brash and roguish young nephew feels like shedding a few tears himself the happy ending of the plays title comes when the white employer phones and asks one of the aunts to come over and babysit announcing that he and his nymphomaniac of a wife have reconciled and that there will be no divorce in day of absence billed as a reverse minstrel show the comedy is broad and heavy the negro actors wear white faces and a few of them are wildly ingenuous a lilywhite young southern matron for example is played in bright blonde shirley temple curls and a sheer white nightgown the towns mayor expertly mugged by playwright ward is all southern colonel blimpy and blustery and one of the local gentry cruelly a prototype is a lazy drawling obscenity the plays proposition concerns the reaction among the whites in a southern town when all the nigrahs suddenly vanish panic and pandemonium garbage collects services go lacking households go unattended families cannot function industries grind to a halt hospitals are menacedthings fall apart in desperation the town even tries to borrow some nigrahs from some other town it is all a clownerie unapologetic buffoonerybut it whacks the funny bone and it drives home a deadly stiletto so what happened well the audiencewhich was about threefifths black on opening nightate it up they were practically rolling in the aisles but bright and early the following morning critic glenna syse gave the impression that she had attended a wake pronounced she okas satirethe subject is on target sitting pretty for a sharpshooter trouble is ward takes aim kills and then keeps shooting at the body he doesnt know how to develop his premise dramatically after his first volley he loses grasp instead of gaining momentum it just lies there and soon becomes tiresome tiresome tiresome for whom certainly not for the audience but then miss syse winds up her critique a pity the tiresomeness because his wards ideas are good but his execution is completely inadequate and unfortunately his olayers do more to handicap than ielp his material plain poppycock and she never once mentioned the hilarity in the audience however miss syse had given her real thesis away in the first paragraphs of her review and it actually was unnecessary to read through to the conclusion here is the way she began douglas turner ward is that uncommon combinationboth playwright and actorand he appeared in both capacities he proved among other things that he is a versatile and vigorous voice in the american theater but then came this there are far too few negroes acting in and writing for the american theater and that is one reason why wards contribution deserves special attention all the old crowing condescension in between her beginning and her ending miss syse glossed over the essence of the two plays she even judged day of absence as a more significant work when that evaluation is questionable for happy ending is rooted in hard fact day of absence is flight of fancy the first play suggests something of the ingenuous strategy negroes have had to fashion for survival while day of absence chiefly highlights the ironic need and the neurotic fixation white southerners have for the black pariahs among them significance too is subjective miss syses review appeared in the suntimes under a banner headline which proclaimed negro playwrightactors satires fail in execution that was at least a matter of opinion among the whites in the audience and it was a baldfaced lie for the blacks but there you are back where we started the black playwright and the white critic are residents of two different worlds clearly the worlds are moving no nearer together just as clearly it is useless for the residents of the one world to keep trying to impose their values and their views on the residents of the other world happy ending and day of absence speak to black people with the resonance of experience the tragedy is that too few black people will avail themselves of its melody and mirth but that is the greater part of the probl the history of the jazz v r ifa y musician in america is the history of the worst kind of oppression ever perpetrated on a group of people worse because the individuals being oppressed are undoubtedly highly talented persons worse still because they have always existed on the periphery of success they have seen their art make millions for others while they themselves starved or at best barely lived at a subsistence level and for many complex reasons as a group they have been unable to do anything about their condition they go on hoping for individual success hoping for that one chance to break through but it goes without saying very few of them ever break through the best of them die like charlie parker and herbie nichols tragic and broken men who spent the last days of their lives desperately seeking to reaffirm the validity of their art and dignitv a b spellman a young poet political analyst and music critic has attempted to tell the story of four of these men in the book four lives in the bebop business pantheon the four musicians are ornette coleman cecil taylor the late herbie nichols and jackie mclean spellman has allowed the musicians to tell their own stories and has himself been contented with writing an interesting introduction and with occasionally interpreting the personal comments of the musicians in a larger social context therefore it is not an accident that the experience of these four musicians is ramified not only throughout the lives of other black musicians and also serve as a microcosm of the experience of black america in general essentially it is the experience of rejection no they are asking for acceptance for some intrinsic value that they may have they have seen their legitimate attempts to develop a meaningful art thwarted by everyone from the manager in a night club to those white music critics who set themselves up as judges of black music and then begin to dictate what is right and wrong critics who approach the music with the usual white western prejudices this latter aspect of the problem for example has led cecil taylor to hold most of the critics in great contempt spellman quotes him as saying critics are sustained by our vitality from afar the uninformed egos evergrowing arbitrarily attempt to give absolutes often the absolutes are the classical norms of western music and have very little to do with what black musicians are attempting taylor points out that the critics often look for european derivatives in his music while overlooking references which grow out of his experience with afroamerican musicians like duke ellington milt jackson and miles davis the trouble was cecil explains they couldnt hear they are listening to the music from a culturally biased point of view this helps nobody and it incenses the musician driving him to a more bitter state of mind this is the aesthetic side of the question on the business side musicians are forced to work for incredibly low wages the record companies are really no help binding the artist to ridiculous contracts and further it has been asserted cheating on the royalties its all one large mess and the pain goes on and on when the breaks come they are never enough they couldnt possibly be since they are often obtained at the expense of artistic integrity and because of the particularly racist nature of american society the jazz musicians entry into the mainstream is untaken with mixed emotions further his relationship wth the establishment is not an equitable one several outspoken musicians like andrew hill a very talented pianist and musicianwriter archie shepp have pointed this out on numerous occasions the black musician is never presumed by white america to be on an equal footing with the classical performer another aspect of spellmans book which should interest us is the tendency towards social alienation which is characteristic particularly of the socalled new musicians this alienation is directly related to the social life of the artist and it is somehow related to the audience which is attracted to the music unlike black music of a few years ago this music is very often played in places more frequented by whites than blacks therefore around a musician like ornette coleman for example there exists a mystique founded primarily on the unstable interest of whites this statement is not intended to take anything away from colemans music it is intended more to put it into its proper social context although coleman has his musical roots in the honking blues sound of the forties and fifties his music is rarely played in the black community the reasons are both economic and social the most apparent hangup in this alienation is that here is an art which is forged out of souls of black people but which black people rarely have the opportunity of appreciating aside from the personal alienation that affects black artists there is the lack of economic security in the black community economics should not be viewed as the prime reason for this alienationthis tendency of our creative individuals to seek refuge in what leroi jones calls the liberated zones of the metropolis most of the black communities of america have not developed the cultural institutions that would sustain and develop a legitimate artistic expression part of the blame for this lies with the negro bourgoisie which for many sociohistorical reasons has not been persistent enough in turning inward on some of its own problems this leaves the musician ready prey to those outside of his group who will throw the slightest crumbs his way and it leads to the torture of a cecil taylor or an ornette coleman spellman has touched on this in his book and the substance of these remarks is reaffirmed in his discussions with all of the musicians represented the other two musicians herbie nichols and jackie mclean do not express the same sense of frustration as taylor and coleman that is these latter musicians express almost an existential aloneness that is not apparent in the lives of herbie nichols and jackie mclean and it is interesting to note that neither nichols nor mclean have had it any easier than coleman or taylor a partial explanation lies in the natural differences in personalities and life experiences otherwise the differences can be explained in the general direction of the art of these musicians the development of nichols and mclean is more closely tied to innovations in the jazz tradition and the concomitant social relations which relate to that tradition while for taylor and coleman there seems to be a tendency to depart from the tradition i say seems to be because i am certain that cecil taylor does not see himself as departing from the tradition of ellington monk and nichols but in artistic terms extending it what i am attempting to describe essentially is a tendency to socially escape from the wellsprings of the music which has its roots in the black community herbie nichols for all his employment problems is seen intermittently playing before black audiences spellman further points out nichols interest in the popular dance rhythm the mambo and his interest in african music on the other hand mclean was very much associated with the uptown scene in his early musical development and even now is active whenever possible in the social welfare of the community recently musicians and writers like archie shepp and leroi jones have referred to the music personified by ornette coleman and cecil taylor as revolutionary music i feel that this is an abuse of terms the music of archie shepp cecil taylor albert alyer ornette coleman and many other similarly orientated musicians is not revolutionary in any manner that is socially observable this music is exciting however and extremely artistic and it could stand on that alone the appellative revolutionary is not necessary however in order for this music to become tionary it must extend itself into the black community in a manner which heretofore it has failed to do it must mean to the community what the supremes the impressions and james brown now mean and it must have a direct bearing on the political and social life of the community the struggles of the community must somehow be mirrored in the music and in a manner that is readily felt by the people currently the only things revolutionary about the new music are its technical innovations and those are not enough four lives in the bebop business is a significant contribution to the literature of jazz nevertheless there is a need for a more definitive work the field is wide open with many important musicians fast fading into the past and no significant work which evaluates their lives and art spellmans book does not propose any solutions to the problems of the jazz musician and many of the musicians themselves are confused about what to do most of them see their problems from a purely individualistic point of view the problem becomes simply one of failure to obtain employment this is at base true there is also the question of race and the prejudiced manner in which the critical establishment evaluates the music all of this is in spellmans book but a way out of these problems is not so the question iswill more exceptionally gifted musicians like taylor coleman and mclean continue to subsist semirecognized by white america die unknowns like herbie nichols or will they rescue themselves through the unity of their numbers this was attempted once with the jazz composers guild which spellman speaks of but was perhaps a premature effort several young musicians eg milford graves and andrew hill have proposed constructive programs these go from financing musicianowned recording companies to establishing music institutes which could be supported by the community and as well receive funds from private and governmental sources but time is running out there are more and more musicians with no place to go it is also essential that the black_power movement begin to address itself to this whole issue of preserving and controlling the cultural products of the black community the movement must also give the artist a way of expressing his view of the world regrettably many people in the movement view the black artist with the same disdain as the overall white society spellman has helped us all by providing us with an intensely human look at four musicians who deserve far more attention than they are now getting four musicians whose lives have been marred by the appalling malaise of the american cultural scene the house hidden in a grove of fir trees was made of wood wetly painted so that the boards almost glowed in the dark because wood is so plentiful most of the people who lived in the community surrounding the forest preserve preferred brick houses only people living within the forest had wooden homes and they were few in number if the census takers knew of the familys existence mr mack the head would have been classified as a dragger since chopping down trees was illegal in the forest preserve he had to wait for a natural calamity such as a thunderstorm to uproot trees and shrubbery then he dragged the dead trunk or as much of the wood as he could chop and carry to his back yard once a year usually in the spring before the beginning of the tourist season mr mack took the animals and dolls he had carved from his dragging to the main craft shop in town the women who owned the shop were always pleased to see him his squirrels and pigs were very popular with people shopping for souvenirs driving through to the western states he never said anything other than to discuss prices and ask about the advance on his commission he never tipped his hat or said thank you or even called the women by their names but of course one could not expect too much from his kind no matter how respectable he lookedthe ladies knew that and when the customers asked about the artist the sisters were quick to point out that he was the towns talented negro citizen we get along with him awfully well the fatter of the women would say yes the other sister usually completed the dialogue we can count on seeing him once a year like clockwork i dont understand places like the south we never have racial trouble here mrs mack never came into town her last trip down the path occurred several springs ago mr mack brought the bicycle from under the leanto to drive to the hospital for the birth of their son alvin alvin one of two living beings they brought from mississippi died three days after birth her doctor could not understand what extinguished the babys thin cries when she had seen the stiff little body for the last time mrs mack heard the physicians talking in the corridor of the shining hospital its almost as if the little fellow was afraid to breathe one doctor said mrs mack shut her ears knowing that the doctor spoke the truth she could do nothing but be grateful that her infant son would be buried in this quiet land their other son called rabbit grew into a healthy child with long limbs like the trees he climbed now that he did not require careful attention her days were spent in cooking and in cleaning the housea house that belonged to her she seldom thought of her white family in mississippi the baby boys whose diapers she changed between cleaning and cooking were no longer a part of her mind ever since she and mr mack shut the cabin door for the last time she had succeeded in putting the town out of her thoughts the town with all of the pale faces that ruined her baby frightened and angered her but she and mr mack knew better than to become angry in their town at first they decided to stay hoping that holding him and cuddling him would make their son forget the circle of bright faces in the mississippi field he had come home from playing shirt torn pants caked with red dirt where the boys from town had sat him down and pinched his nose threatening to stop his breathing they had thrown him one from the other sometimes dropping him the way a child bounces a rubber ball by some miracle he had limped home letting the boys take with them his power to speak they could take no chances with other children a voiceless child is after all powerless so during county fair week when she was pregnant again and the whole town was beset with confusion they put on their best clothes left the furniture and starched uniforms in the cabin and walked into town at the bus station they purchased tickets to jackson a usual event all of their friends had relatives to visit there at the jackson bus terminal they walked straight to the map on the terminal wall mrs mack closed her eyes and pointed to the state where they would live when the bus arrived at the town they walked out of it feeling their way toward the forest preserve during the summer the weather was warm in the day life in the forest was like being at home except for sleeping on the leaves by the time fall came mr mack had begun building the house adding to the two rooms year by year a sturdy house he built he himself hauling the logs and painting them white somehow he had managed mrs mack never understood these things to tap a power line so that they had electricity for the small stove mrs mack did not mind the limitations candle light was a small fee for her own life and hers was a good life she was comforted with the thought that alvin was at peace in his new world and rabbit seemed to find some quiet in the woods away from the pale faces in his head if she had her way he would never meet any people of the other kind at least not until he was old enough to understand that some colors were naturally evil she could hear rabbit now in his own room banging the two tin cups the cups had been her measuring utensils until one day she dropped them and their clatter on the smooth floor entranced her son he refused to give up the cup and when he saw others of varying sizes he insisted on holding them in his chubby hands measuring the two people around him the din from the next room muffled by the wooden beams that separated the kitchen was a constant reminder that he was at home safe with her until he grew old enough to protect himself rabbit sat on the floor legs tucked underneath straddling a sunbeam from the open window his head faced the screen the afternoon sun warming his wide nostrils making his eyelids blink it was time to feed the bear mixing the milk from the box with the same brisk motion he had observed in his mother he poured the liquid air into the smallest cup bearlie would not open his mouth until he pushed a finger in the orange slit and forcibly brought the cup to the bears face he held the cup just so until bearlie had drunk he turned the cup slowly in the sunlight at once washing and rinsing the silver color bouncing in his hand he put the cup to his ear and listened to his mothers footsteps in the next room she would soon be in to look at him when the soft swish of her broom no longer scratched the floor boards her feet would thump toward him in the blue slippers he could feel her shadow behind him youre quiet today rabbit her voice was puffs of soft breath tickling the hair on his neck do you want to see the picture book no he did not want to see the picture book but because she would sit down beside him he would turn the pages his fingers walking slowly stopping at pictures until she grew tired and returned the ebony to the shelf come on in the kitchen with me she seemed to sing as she spoke standing at the door waiting he looked quickly at her then at the window comparing her to the sunlight beyond the sill then slowly he brought the chunky legs together and sprang up bouncing the bearlie in his arms will you pass the milk mrs mack her husband softly touched his wifes hand before he spoke she already had begun sliding the pitcher they did not need words between them for rabbit who should grow up knowing his parents had mister and mistress attached to their names they spoke rabbit was too busy shaking canned milk into his oatmeal turning the paste into soup to notice them mr mack had raised the spoon to his mouth when the strange noise made his hand tremble he looked at his wife to see if she had heard and found her eyes paralyzed his fear caught in her eyes surely no one had driven a car into their part of the forest preserve while they sat stiffened waiting to see if the noise resumed rabbit did not seem to hear the sound he continued stirring his cereal in wide swoops pouring syrup into little wells of oatmeal when he had finished his bowl scraping the sides with two flat fingers they had not heard the noise again the family finished the meal in silence days and nights were not counted each passing evening brought the darkness more quickly to their supper table the leaves were coming down sometimes in great bunches leaving the trees behind the grove arms up in the air his mother said the trees had to undress for the winter after a while he had come to believe everything that she told him whatever she said was always so soon the trees would be covered with green making the cool spots for him and bearlie away from the sun he was walking with bearlie stopping sometimes to wait for a quivering leaf then just when the red wrinkle was coming toward him the wind would blow away the leaf he was at the top of the hill now looking down at the path his father kept cleared of grass he saw the woman walking and knew immediately she was part of the strange noise he had heard past the trees he had listened to the crunch of leaves and twigssomeone walking who did not know his way around the woods she walked in sunlight and the bits and pieces of fallen sun were woven in her hair playing games there at once he wanted to reach out and touch the curls to see if the sun would rub off but something about her made him hush she was a strange kind of person such a funny color perhaps he had seen someone like her but his head would not bring the pictures from the whirring circles into focus if he reached out perhaps she would remember but she did not look up at his outstretched arm she walked past his fingertips toward his house then suddenly he ran determined to leave the stranger behind mrs mack was measuring oatmeal for muffins when she saw him running charging straight toward her he was clutching the bear so tightly all of the stuffing in one arm had coagulated near the top making a shoulder droop he was trying to show her something his eyes glancing at her sweeping the forest preserve and back at her something had frightened her baby she reached down to comfort him and saw the woman walking up the path toward them she pulled rabbit toward her and at the same instant used him to shield herself from the creature hush rabbit its all right see what you have done to my child her eyes carried even harsher words over rabbits head what do you want mrs mack spoke surprised at the strength of her own voice good morning the thin lips spotted with pink smiled im rosemarie langley from the county service we didnt know you people lived so deep in the forest goodness you really have a long drive into town mrs mack stood in her doorway we dont go but your husband comes in to sell his exquisite carvings he goes but we stay here we found out about you people through your husband one of our caseworkers clerks parttime at sears and saw your husband purchase a boys snowsuit just by chance she mentioned the suit to me and i started wondering why a snowsuit that big wasnt in school and here i am she was suddenly breathless but her teeth became bigger with each smile oh im not here officially today was such a nice day for a drive i parked the car by the picnic grounds and decided to try and find you people our boy doesnt talk so theres no need to send him to school might as well not go if he never says nothing miss langley took a step nearer the door have you had his hearing tested she asked for a moment she looked as if she might peer inside rabbits head he hears a lot of things we dont hear he just dont say nothing about them and we like him the way he is mrs macks voice was stubborn and with each step the caseworker took she retreated farther into the kitchen dragging rabbit on her apron may i come in miss langley asked looks like youre here already mrs mack was surprised at herself a second time at home she wouldnt dare talk like that to one of them but the woman did not pay attention to her curtness now that im here please may i sit down what lovely wood did your husband do the carving on this chair he made all of the furniture youre very fortunate to have such a talented husband is your son artistic too he likes to look at books and he likes to feed the squirrels when he gets older i guess hell learn to use a knife rabbit still had not looked up keeping very still while his mother smoothed his hair stroking away his fear the womans voice made a strange humming sound reaching into every corner of the kitchen when he comes to school of course hell learn to read and write then we can give him tests to see if he has an artistic bent he doesnt need to go to your school when he decides he wants to read the picture book one of us will teach him the words oh you mean youre educated miss langley colored her cheeks matching the pink lips i mean you and your husband went to school i can read a cookbook and he knows how to read a road map but all thats behind us now we dont have no use for your learning those we know who had it never had much use for us she smoothed her son from her apron youre sitting on his chair he dont like the others please move oh im terribly sorry she stood and fluffed the cushion she had crushed mrs mack picked up the shivering rabbit and sat him down perhaps warm cocoa would soothe him cocoa with a pink marshmallow floating on top she dragged his chair to the stove while she mixed cocoa together they watched the caseworker such a cozy little place do you mind if i look around miss langley pulled away from the table and rabbit immediately clutched his mothers skirts she pushed back the curtain only one bedroom thank heavens you have two beds she said shaking her head but do you really think thats wise having him sleep in the same room with you mrs mack felt herself blush shame on her for making such talk even if she didnt come right out and say her thoughts in front of rabbit its not good to have a child exposed to too much miss langley called from the bedroom why half the juveniles we have in court are there because they grew up too fast mrs mack continued stirring the cocoa the woman couldnt possibly think she preached something new the thing to do was not let them grow up at all keep them away from people who came prying looking into affairs not concerning them im fixing my baby some cocoa would you like some when the woman nodded she brought the cups from their hook and reached for the marshmallows my what handsome mugs i bet your husband carved those too the cocoa will take a while mrs mack answered rejecting the compliment she pulled a chair beside rabbit and again both of them stared at the intruder she had such pretty hair not knobby and crinkly like his mothers she wasnt even sitting near the door and it shone like his book when light fell on the pages his mother didnt like her either and she really had done nothing but walk into his room and other times she smiled at him the teeth locked together as if they guarded a big hole he dug his fingers into the arm of the chair wondering how bearlie would look covered with some of her hair he would like to take a single strand to cover bearlies gray fur then when night came the brightness of bearlies new coat could light the darkness around his bed he could smell the cocoa feel the bubbles bursting in the pan as if the cocoa had hiccoughs then his mother poured three cups and allowed him to reach first with the cup in his hands his tongue darted out to catch a precious drop oozing down the side into his palm thank you mrs mack it really smells delicious there was silence mrs mack watched the pale fingers pick up the cup and hoped she would burn her tongue why couldnt those people leave her family alone why did they always have to come inside when they were not wanted looking with icy eyes freezing everything trying to make everybody in the world like them every last one of them made her ill how old is your son nine going on ten why mrs mack do you realize that other children his age are halfway through the fourth grade theres nothing you can teach him that will help preserve him why mrs mack we try to turn our children into useful citizens surely his heritage is worth preserving rabbit looked from one to the other two bright shining eyes peering over the cup attached to his nose we have such a good group of parents who come to our family meetings perhaps you and mr mack might come we have an indian couple who go quite regularly im sure the others wouldnt mind you two at all she smiled at rabbit and mrs macks swallow of cocoa suddenly turned cold in her mouth mrs mack said nothing she wished the woman would leave truthfully she dared not wish her away she would only return with more of her own kind bringing the sheets of paper and asking questions while one of them marked mrs macks answers in little boxes out of her head came memories of the surveyswomen from town walking through her door after barely knocking holding their noses and brushing the chairs before they sat down she would not live through that time again she would not let them force rabbit to talk in their words with their reason her son was much healthier chasing pictures inside his own head he did not need this pale woman would you like some more cocoa goodness no this cup is still so hot i can hardly drink she smiled again mrs mack looked over at rabbit sitting drowsily in his chair the cocoa had made him relax his fat palms drooping over the arms of the chair its past his naptime she said shaking rabbit gently on the shoulder come on now lets go to bed may i help you tuck him in miss langley stood and waited to follow the boy and his mother she watched mrs mack turn down the sheet and slide rabbit between the covers my what an exquisitely carved bedboard she said dont tell me more of your husbands handiwork rabbit had fallen asleep his face on the pillow as static as the ducks and squirrels on his headboard mrs mack walked from the room the social worker tippytoed behind her good miss langley whispered when they had returned to the kitchen now we can talk you never can tell what little children might overhear she smiled with half her teeth hidden would suggest that you bring your son down to the county clinic early next week we can run some tests and if necessary enroll him in a special school why if the county has to send a social worker after you there could be all kinds of trouble mrs mack nodded watching her husband walk up the path straight to the back of miss langleys chair he walked silently accustomed to hunting small game now she watched him stop and sniff the air he could always tell when one of them was in the vicinity theyre not like us he always said they even smell different she watched him creep to the leanto on the side of the house where he stored the carving tools satisfied that she need not explain to him she turned her eyes toward miss langley my husband should be returning soon maybe you ought to talk to him at that moment mr mack walked through the door he put the bag of hazelnuts on the floor the wooden mallet he used as nutcracker was anchored on top im glad to see you mrs mack said this is miss langley she wants to bring rabbit down to the clinic and she wants us to go to some meetings miss langley turned her smile to face him she saw the heavy mallet coming down but even then her eyes did not believe he hit her four times because she was after all the fourth visitor i didnt think you were ever coming his wife said putting brown paper bags under the bodys head to catch the blood she began scrubbing the floor with soda before the stain set in the wood too bad robert had to see her he answered picking up miss langley im really sorry if id known she was here pestering you i d have come straight home he opened the screen door will you please bring the shovel its on the side of the house she finished scrubbing and carried the bucket to the porch toss ing the pail so that pink sudsy water melted into the ground they walked past the fir trees deeper into the forest preserve here he asked depositing the body on the ground she nodded and handed him the shovel at least this one is full grown she said remembering last winter when the boy with spotted glasses was lost from his hiking group he came to their door for something hot to drink cold to his toes he had said he was surprised to see people living in the middle of the woods and then mr mack knocked him unconscious dragging his body to the front yard the forest preserve was so large he knew the search party would not reach their part of the woods until morning by then he had carried the stiff body to a spot close to town the newspaper account that mr mack read said the boy apparently fell struck his head on a rock and wandered dazedly before collapsing he froze to death over night the other two did not matter they were old ladies hunting mushrooms and herbs so they said mrs mack watched her husband uncover the hole then drop the shovelfuls of dirt over the slender body completely covering the golden hair she wished he would hurry updarkness would soon catch them she had to get home and sweep the air out of the house anything she thought to remove that terrible odor before bedtime they say that she got ri on the train in chii cago after transferal ring from the dearborn station she was plump and matronly and her glasses were tinted so that she might have been a tourist seeking protection from the sun but there was neither sun nor fresh air on the train and she was very pale and very wrinkled the way clerks or indoor people grow after many years of their special protected colorless kind of life she was indeed that nondescript type of person one might be aware of but never really see in a supermarket or at a bargainbasement sale carefully and methodically fingering each item or on a busy streetcorner waiting for the light to change while others with less conscious respect for the letter of the law flowed around her she rode for a whole day before coming into the dining car for a meal she had the special she asked for buttermilk and wanted lightbread instead of rolls the negro waiters all grinned at each other in their secret way when she finished her meal she sat reading a book and looking out at the green flatlands of north dakota until the steward had to ask her to leave so that the waiters could clean up for the next setting she did not protest but left with an indignant flourish of her dress the automatic door to the car leading to the pullman section hissed angrily behind her the steward called her a bitch between his teeth and the waiter who had served her standing next to the steward with his tray under his arm grinned broadly showing his smokestained teeth but when he saw that she had left no tip he called her a cheap bitch aloud and the steward scowled at him after the last setting the waiters sat down to eat their dinner two pullman porters came in with their coffee cans begging for handouts they were very greedy and if given one can of free coffee would always come back expectantly for more as if they had been initially granted all that they could drink they sat down at the waiters table and watched them eat the waiters were very greedy too they ate ravenously the porters watched the waiters for a while then one of them closed his eyes and began to doze the other one an old fellow with eyes aged and tired like an owls looked out at the floating gold of the sunset across the passing wheatfields he watched until the fields became patterns of black and fading gold then he turned to the waiters we got a old southern gal back there he said we had her up here one of the waiters said between huge mouthfuls of beef she got good service but she didnt leave no tip she had me polishin her shoes the porter said but i dont reckon shell pay off when she gets off i didnt put much work out on it anyway he stretched his thin legs under the table they cracked with the sound of dead branches underfoot when it is autumn a woman in pants passed through the car her hair was cut somewhat like a little girls dutch boy and a ringlet of it curled against her cheek she blew at it out of the comer of her mouth and smiled knowingly at the men seated around the table which way to the club car she asked her lipstick was above the line of her mouth so that it looked like a red moustache she was not at all pretty and not at all young two cars ahead one waiter said she turned to go took a few steps and then looked back at the men the two waiters were looking her over one porter was still dozing and the other tired one was seemingly not aware of her how late does it stay open she asked and she tossed her hair batted her eyes and blew on the ringlet all in the same quick movement till twelve one waiter said chicago time the other one added they watched her move through the door shell tip big tomorrow one of them said yeah that old biddy knows where the club car is she been in there all day i seen her battin them greasy eyes at john perry on the bar maybe hell take care of business for her tonight the tired pullman porter said but there was no humor in it and all of their laughs were only polite if he does shell tip big tomorrow one of the waiters said again the porter with the owl eyes pushed the dozing porter time to get the beds down tim he said tim got up slowly and they took their full coffeecans and trudged down the aisle toward the pullman section as they reached the door it opened and the lady who had transferred from dearborn came into the car the two porters stood on either side of the aisle and let her pass between them they wore white jackets with silver buttons which were engraved pullman company together with their black caps with silver plates which also read pullman company and black pants they looked like two painted black statues before the entrance to some fine suburban home she did not notice them but passed silently through the car leaving a scent of something sweet and strong when she entered the club car the woman with the dutch hair was sitting at the bar talking to john perry the bartender who stood behind the bar leaning with his arms on its waxed red surface they were very close and the dutch woman was smiling awkwardly there was no one else in the car the dearborn lady took a table near the far end of the car and began to stare at john perry as he said something low and soft and smileprovoking to the painted thing on the stool across from him the dearborn lady cleared her throat john perry placed his dark thick hand closer to the other softer hand on the bar and did not look up the painted lady made a throaty chuckle like the confusing sound one might hear near a car parked by a frog pond on a summer night i want some service the lady at the end of the car finally said ive been here for ten minutes and i want some service the man looked annoyed as he went over to her table whatll it be lady he said his voice was deep and smooth and almost as greasy as the painted womans lips and it had that familiar ring of professional servitude which is peculiar to small serving people who like their work i want a brandy a benedictine no benedictine this is a train lady she paused ill have a creme de menthe then we dont have that neither try bourbon and water honey the woman at the bar said and she lifted her glass for the lady to see he makes it very good im gonna have another one myself she looked at the bartender as she pushed a fivedollar bill across the bar make yourself one too she told him the lady at the table looked at her fiercely she finally took a rose and settled back taking turns watching the immediate reflections of the two at the bar in the window next to her face and the darkness of the passing countryside beyond their reflections the train lumbered on and it made the only noise save for an occasional giggle and a deepthroated chuckle from the bar finally the woman got up from the stool and said see you later on to the bartender she said it with a contrived unnatural seductivity and she let her waving arm follow her out of the car the dearborn lady still seated at the table and facing the window saw it all through her tinted lenses the bartender began to whistle as he washed the glasses he was a robust fellow but he moved very gracefully behind the bar like a dancer still he splashed a great deal of water on the floor he glanced over at the lady once or twice as she in turn looked alternatively at the darkness beyond the thick window glass and at him but only her eyes moved then the man moved out from behind the bar and came toward her she stiffened and gathered her purse and got up all very quickly he was wiping the tables and whistling as she hurried out of the car in the pullman car the porter was still making the beds he shuffled from one roomette to the next not wasting a single step the occupants came out of their rooms and stood in the hall while he swished and tucked their sheets then he knocked on the dearborn ladys door porter he barked the way a street corner concessionaire would say hot dogs there was no answer so he went in and began turning down the bed she came up behind him and watched his back as he moved about the small compartment she was breathing very hard what time do you lock the doors to the car she asked the doors aint never locked he said not turning to face her how do you keep people out my luggage is in the hall its very expensive watch out for it i sit up all night inside the car yes mam but i we have to sleep we have to sleep in here she said she was very excited yes mam he did not stop his work nor did he look at her but answered her questions and made the bed with the proficiency and cool detachment of one used to confronting stupidity in the intelligent it was bargained and paid for in the price of her ticket and his was a patient and polite endurance of her right to be stupid im a pullman porter he said i been a pullman porter for fortythree years he had finished the bed and he smoothed down a light ripple in the red blanket his hands were rough and wrinkled and the backs of his fingers were very black fortythree years he repeated reminiscently half to himself she could not see his eyes well you cant stay in here tonight she said and moved back into the small compartment as if to possess it entirely with her presence the porter backed out its my job he said she was very nervous now and ran her hands lightly over the sides of her dress her hands stuck to the thin silk you go get the pullman conductor i can talk to him she began to pace up and down the little length of the room the porter returned in a few minutes with the pullman conductor the bluesuited conductor entered the compartment while the porter stood outside the door and watched them his dark old eyes flashing from one face to the other he sits up in the car lady the conductor said its his job he has to be here if anyone rings for him at night the conductor was very irritated he had already started to undress for bed and his tie hung loosely about his neck the lady was perspiring now and the little beads of sweat glistened on her temples in the glare of the white light overhead i cant and i wont sleep in the same car with that that gentleman thats your business if you dont sleep lady the conductor said he stays in the car the conductor was very mad now the lines in his forehead grew very red and his nose which was large grew even larger and redder we have a right to sleep here without these people coming in doing things whats he done to you lady hes black hes black and she said it with the exasperation and utter defeat of an inexperienced teacher whose patience has been exhausted and who can only stamp the right answer into the mind of a stupid child hes a porter the conductor said the porter who stood all the while like a child waiting for punishment seemed to droop and wither and grow smaller and his eyes which had only minutes before flashed brightly from the face of the conductor to the enraged face of the lady now seemed to dull and turn inward as only those who have learned to suffer silently can turn their eyes inward he was a very old man and he grew older even older than his occupation or the oldest and most obsequious pullman porter people were looking out of their compartments and the dearborn lady hearing them raised her voice in a plea he sleeps in here he sleeps in here with us she shouted to them down the hall the painted woman opened the door to compartment g and listened and smiled and shook her head and then closed the door again and the rest listened and weighed the thought which was a new one deserving some consideration but the conductor said that it was necessary for comfort and they agreed for the most part and returned to their rooms only the porter stood outside the door looking guilty it was finally decided that the dearborn lady would take a seat in the coaches for the night she wanted it that way the porter would sleep as he had always slept sitting up in the back of the car with his eyes closed and his mind awake and his coffee can by his side and the small bright nightlight over his bowed head and his ear next to the buzzer in case someone should ring everyone agreed that it was the way things should be it was necessary for comfort and besides it was his job and later that night when john perry the bartender who danced and splashed a great deal of water when he washed glasses stole into the dark sleeping car he paused for a minute before the bent old man on the hard porters seat the coffee can had fallen over on the seat and john perry picked it up and placed it on the floor next to the old mans feet then he knocked very softly on the door to compartment g and after a while it was opened and quickly closed behind him in the final months of writers assemsembled on the campuses of two predominantly negro colleges and at a conference on racism in cetirs american education and in at least one instance the sparks flew at the american federation of teachers confab on negro history in washington novelist william melvin kelley electrified a gather ing of several hundred teachers by telling them bluntly that there is no hope for american education mr kelleys thesis developed to the obvious dismay of many of his listeners revolved around the murderous nature of american society he said that the early americans resolved to slay all the indians they could get their hands on then went on to take texas and southwest territory from the mexicans then invaded cuba and nicaragua and santo domingo and china dropped atomic bombs on japan massacred koreans and vietnamese start with a society that can rationalize genocide and slavery in the name of progress in the name of god in the name of christianity in whatever way and then gets away with it and you will have a society that can rationalize anything at all he said the killing of one million indonesians in the name of anticommunism or the dropping of not just one but two atomic bombs america scored another firstandonly there too with all the talk about what china will do or russia will do america is the only country that has done it in the face of the fact that none of the ugly facts he had cited were ever taught in american history mr kelley said to the teachers its not your fault what you have done would be too much for any group of human beings to face so you will go on and on killing and justifying that killing that is my view of an honest american history not a matter of hidden facts but of interpretation john henrik clarke one of the other writers on the panel writers look at history managed to shock the teachers by dismissing white teachers as being ineligible to teach negro history to black children that raised a storm of protest and mr clarke was forced to backtrack a few steps after all one of the chairmen of the program committee for the conference was a white person a young woman who has successfully taught negro history in the public schools and colleges of illinois the other two writers on the panel were novelist ronald fair many thousands gone hog butcher and critic robert a bone the negro novel in america both men dealt with the problem of historical balance mr fair from the contemporary perspective and mr bone from the historical viewpoint at alabama a m college down near huntsville the redoubtable rosey e pool mounted the little colleges second writers conference she organized and directed the first one in the writers on hand this time around were mostly poetssamuel allen paul vesey margaret burroughs dudley randall and mari evans who was a repeater poet margaret danner also appeared as a special guest of the threeday sessions miss pool is the anthologist and editor responsible for beyond the blues and l am the new negro a londoner by choice she is a native of holland she is an energetic traveler and teacher the fall semester at alabama a m was her second semester there as a special member of the faculty her title this time was visiting professor of literature early this year she took off for south america the other campus conference took place at lincoln university in pennsylvania and the writers who participated were novelist john oliver killens playwrights ronald milner and loften mitchell and essayistcritic wilmer f lucas negro digest editor hoyt w fuller acted as conference moderator the lincoln conference interestingly was organized by dr charles hamilton who is chairman of the political science department and there were no members of the english department noticeably present during the conference the exceptions it should be added were two members of the conference itself mr milner who is serving as writerinresidence and mr lucas who is a visiting professor of english at both alabama and lincoln the old dilemma of art versus activism raised its gray head though somewhat wearily it was never much of an argument at alabama although it did raise a few hackles at lincoln some black writers persist in the doctrine which in essence states that they are just writers not negro writers meaning usually that they are free of the necessity of thinking of themselves as negroes their opposites feel that they protest too much that in a racist society as this one surely is a writer who exists as just a writer and not a negro writer is about as natural as a threeheaded heifer it is always interesting though that the division among the writers relative to this dilemma finds the young and youngthinking writers on the side where art and activism pose no problem of conciliation the alabama conference had the advantage of a captive audience since the appearance of the writers on the campus signalled a major event for the plenary session students from surrounding schools were bused in to hear the writers many of the students have rural backgrounds and their exposure to sophisticated writers from the nations big urban centers proved stimulating the story was somewhat different at lincoln no effort had been made to persuade the students to attend the conference in fact it was held on a saturday precisely the day when most of the students had abandoned the campus for the weekend dr hamilton indicated that this had not been inadvertent he was much more interested in having students attend the conference because they wanted to the turnout was small but enthusiastic and some very real questions were put to the writers both during the panel discussion and during the small group discussions which followed one of the amusing things revealed during the lincoln conference was the existence of an underground movement aimed at overthrowing the name of the institution certain of the students want to change the name from lincoln university to frederick douglass university after all said one of them theres a lincoln university in missouri and were willing to give them exclusive rights to the name last december some to teachers and laymen concerned with the problem of bringing view of history into american education assembled in washington for a threeday conference auspices of the american federation of teachers it was a historic event for the first time since public education was established in the nation an interracial group of educators of power and influence openly challenged the traditional approach to the teaching of american history and reolved to exert their power and influence to begin the overthrow of the traditional a virtual galaxy of cont porary scholars and historians dressed the conference on vari cp i osor of sociology at roosevelt university and sterling brown professor of english literature at howard u other speakers were ossie davis the actorplaywright and lerone bennett jr ebony magazine senior editor both of whom were conference conveners and keith baird a new york educator and haryouact official the spade work for the conference was done in chicago headquarters for the teachers union by a conference committee headed by benjamin solomon as temporary chairman the committee included arthur l reese director aft civil_rights dept carolyn reese materials chairman and sterling stuckey and beatrice young program chairmen other members of the conference committee were lydia lewis publicity william simons host chairman sidney harris attendance and bernard flicker and margaret s webb resolutions a bonus feature of the conference was an opening night general session on writers look at history the writers were novelists ronald fair and william melvin kelley critic robert a bone and editoressayist john henrik clarke and their perspective on history and the problem of adjusting it proved more than a little provocative kelley for example stated flatly there is no hope for american education panel discussions organized with the presence of consultants followed the major addresses and suggested resolutions were invited from all participants in the conference in the end the conference passed a resolution calling for the discarding or boycotting of all textbooks which neglect or distort the role of afroamericans in the history of the nation it did not simply resolve to do this the conference also provided those in attendance with materials and sources of materials which could help them in achieving the task of redressing the balance of history in school texts the conference was held at the washington hilton hotel
malcolm_x was three menmalcolm little malcolm_x and malik elshabazz as young ulqjy little he was by his own confession a harlem hustler and criminal converted by the black muslims when in prison he was malcolm_x one of elijahs fiercest disciples falling out with elijah muhammad and after visiting africa and mecca he became malik elshabazz a muslim not black muslim prophet as malcolm little he asserted his personality by attacking the white world and robbing it as malcolm_x he rejected whites completely and sought to be a savior of his people not just a political savior but one of individual defeated negroes then in mecca he realised that mankind is one family from which no race not even white devilsis excluded having believed and said this he was shot dead in his prime it is this intellectual and moral evolution that makes malcolm heroic most of us if negroes would never have passed beyond the stage of criminal revolt some might have moved on to the second stage of personal puritanism political militancy and race hatred but few could go on to accept as malcolm did a dangerous paradox that negroes must fight every inch for their rights but not yield to the white crime of racialism malcolms negro detractors believe that in rejecting black racialism he rejected his people his white liberal enemies think that in becoming a muslim convert he was escaping from black muslim neuroses into the comfort of an exotic faith i think malcolm never denied his people for a second but saw that their cause could only be advanced within a context wider than that of u s negro politics with his contacts in africa malcolm founded an organisation for afroamerican unity believing that the black struggles in africa and america were one from these emerged a tentative black nationalist movement which rejected black and white dogmatism there is no reassurance for whites in malcolms life when he was a harlem layabout they used him fixing kicks for whites was his specialty when he was a black muslim they feared and hated him when he turned to mecca they saw he was rejected by his people and despised him but for those with eyes to see he left a message for dark eyes it is threefoldthat only militancy will win that the worlds black struggle is indivisible that hatred is valid but not if it leaves the hater with only his hate for blue eyes the message is that blacks will never again be satisfied with concessions promises or gifts by conventional standards his life was a failure firstly because the whole fight of the american negro has hitherto been a failure next because the white americans have also failed disastrously to live with colored americansand since malcolm was very american he shares this failure last because in a mundane sense he never got anywhere but his example and influence are germinal for the prime american problemand perhaps world problemis the racial one the death of a hero has a rightness a perfection if a white had killed malcolm there would have been a riotthen oblivion but his own people killed him because they could not bear what he was demanding of them and then the whites sighed in relief and the blacks knew this was a desecration they had killed themselves martin_luther_king jr having conquered the montgomerys birminghams and selmas of the south made a momentous m decisionchicago the challenge of this great northern ghetto was considered by most civil_rights leaders as insurmountable nevertheless king announced his determination to make an allout effort to shake the foundation of the slums and the powers that held negroes captive mayor richard daley shook and quivered in anger at this blatant intrusion into the affairs of his city he was not alone in making his decision king was obviously aware that chicago contained more than slums and housing discrimination it also contained one of the most controversial negro leaders in the nationdr joseph harrison jackson chicago was to become the battleground between two men whose individual philosophies and activities had already split the negro masses in general and the national baptist convention usa inc in particular with the arrival of dr_king dr jackson immediately took him to task as the push to eliminate the slums and institute a program for open housing began jackson utilized radio press and television to deplore the activities of the protest movement his attacks did not go unnoticed and he suddenly became the hero of backlashers and black conservatives the summer of was long and hot a water sprinkler became the cause of riots and national guardsmen were called in to quiet the racial storm when king was accused of being an outsider disturbing the peace of the city jackson agreed while king was urging negroes to unite in soldier field jackson was urging them to stay at home as the religious leader of an estimated negroes jacksons voice pricked the momentum that king had hoped to develop history was playing a repeat performance the kingjackson feud was in spirit a replay of the booker t washingtonwilliam e b du bois conflict this time the theater was chicago and the two new actors were ready to give sterling performances in the roles washington and du bois had originally created unknown to many the chicago competition between king and jackson can be considered the final act act i scene i took place years ago in miami florida where the national baptist convention usa inc convened to select its new leader trying out for the part and winning the role was its current president who today holds that convention in a powerful ironclad grip joseph harrison jackson is a spellbinding orator friends and critics alike accord him to be one of americas great preachers he successfully utilized this talent to lift himself to one of the highest offices in the world of negro religionpresident of the national baptist convention usa inc winning the presidency after a stormy all night session in it was considered at the time that his election gave promise of a new type of leadership he came to that helm when dynamic and constructive leadership was in demand we want jackson was the cry of the delegates and they got him for the past years they have had him in the early years of his presidency jacksons followers and admirers were legion some of the strongest negro ministers in the nation were among his followers and believers north south east and west men like j pious barber editor of the national baptist voice j raymond henderson california gardner taylor new york martin_luther_king sr atlanta marshall shepard philadelphia and dr benjamin mays president of morehouse college jacksons comer initially was crowded with intellectuals today none of these men are with him because one by one they deserted his camp the causes for desertion are many however two of the most important were jacksons reluctance to give up his office and his power plays to remain and his strange position on civil_rights during the years of the negro revolt act iichange scenes at the time of dr jacksons election a small wiry unknown youngster named martin_luther_king jr was developing his theology at crozier theological seminary in philadelphia pa unknown to him and to others at that time was the fact that his name would soon challenge the very structure of the conventional negro church and its leadership after the montgomery alabama bus boycott and the rise of martin_luther_king jr into international fame a new hard look was in order for negro leadership creative protest became the order of the times to negro activists jackson was not among this group although in the past jacksons voice had been one of many raised in eloquent protest against injustices perpetuated against negroes in the south no one could say it like joseph harrison jackson however the activist movement and the philosophy of king soon would divide the ministers into two camps the first issue that brought a schism was the issue of tenure the story of tenure in the national baptist convention usa inc was oddly enough closely allied with the fight for civil_rights from the organization of the convention in and for a period of years only men had served as president of these five had served one year one had served two years and one had served three years the remaining years found four men in strong control of the negro baptists rev w j simmons rev e c morris rev l k williams and dr d v jemison during the late years of dr jemisons term a movement was begun to install young and progressive leadership joseph h jackson was elected one strong plank presented in his campaign limited his term to only four years this modern approach to leadership was accepted by thousands of ministers who had desired for years to free themselves from oneman domination a new article was placed in the constitution as insurance against betrayal the revised constitution read as follows article iv officers election section a president of this convention shall not be eligible for reelection after he has served four consecutive terms or until at least one year has elapsed in the delegates were stunned when a jackson supporter stood on the floor to make a motion that this revision of the constitution be declared null and void when president jackson responded by selecting a committee to examine the constitution voices began to be raised among the voices was that of dr l k jackson the fiery minister from gary indiana he immediately condemned the administration as being immoral for tampering with the constitution dr martin_luther_king sr still a strong supporter of jackson demanded that l k jackson apologize to the convention for the strong language he had used l k jackson refused in denver september the auditorium where the convention met was in a tempest the speakers platform was crowded with ministers from both sidesthose who wished to retain tenure and those who wished it to be declared null and void as the argument rose president jackson rapped for attention he was ignored with a rare display of emotion the president declared that the delegates could have the convention and made an angry exit the lights were turned off in darkness delegates began to stomp and yell for the president to return and restore order jackson would not reappear and the session was at a stalemate in september the convention met in a dingy auditorium in louisville ky this was the session that supposedly would decide the issue the lines were clearly drawn the question of the hour would j h jackson be eligible for reelection or would another leader be chosen both contentions were set forth jacksonites insisted that the tenure provision was null and void because when the convention voted for it it did so illegally it was voted on the wrong day they claimed and that left the constitution as it originally was a president could succeed himself as many times as possible they pointed to the constitutional article that supported their stand this was the legal clincher that the jackson forces held while conceding the fact that it was voted in violation of the constitution the progressive forces contended that the spirit of the constitution was as the majority directed it was the majority wish to have tenure it was not a legal issue they argued it was a matter of ethics jackson should declare himself ineligible as a candidate and rule on the validity of tenure as the convention waited with hushed voices jackson promised to settle the issue once and for all first he quoted from the opinion of a t walden convention attorney based upon my understanding of the ordinary meaning of the word we should think that the amendment tenure would not be properly adopted president jackson then referred to roberts rules of order he quoted any measure adopted contrary to the constitution of the body is null and void therefore said the president in light of the record which shows that the socalled revised constitution was adopted on the wrong day i rule that the socalled revised constitution is null and void and the only valid constitution that the convention has is the constitution of jackson thus ruled himself back into office as his last words fell all hell broke loose and no one could stem the tide amid cries no no no ministers broke down and wept the jacksonites broke into cheers and shouts fists were raised and the air literally shook with rage delegates were on their feet propelled by the tension and disorder rev q l jones then pastor of the fourth street baptist church owensboro ky swung into action trucks had been waiting outside with banners for jackson with a trained crew of delegates jones swept into the auditorium with regal banners proclaiming jackson for president preceded by a bass drum the marchers snaked victoriously around the auditorium a struggle was made for the microphone and the jackson forces commandeered it i move that we suspend the rules and reelect our president by acclamation shouted dr t s harten of brooklyn all those in favor say aye directed another one of the vicepresidents a second wave of anger struck the antijackson forces the election was being called for a full day before it was programmed the jackson people were going to take advantage of the noise and turmoil and declare a reelection by acclamation it was an old convention trick so strong were the voices raised on both sides that the ayes could not be distinguished from the nays both blended into an indistinguishable roar the ayes have it screamed the moderator of disorder and have it they did the jackson forces had broken the back of tenure what had brought about this bid for power on jacksons part critics claim it to be a messianic complexa desire to be considered the deliverer of the negro masses as pastor of the great olivet baptist church in chicago j h jackson lived for power and recognition they said then enters martin_luther_king jr in denver colorado a beaming president led a shy young man down the aisles to the strains of onward christian soldiers it was an inspiring sight president jackson introduced young king to the convention in glowing terms king was at the peak of his popularity and captivated the audience his brilliant address on that occasion letter to america was masterfully delivered his father martin_luther_king sr strode with pride at the back of the auditorium as he listened his pride in his son would not allow him to sit down he glanced around at the delegates to see the effect his boy had upon them what he saw there was the same thing that joseph harrison jackson sawa possible black moses the crowd did not want to let the young man go from that moment negro baptists had an idol martin_luther_king had added the national baptist convention usa inc as another of his conquests critics of jackson point to this as the moment jackson made his decision to remain at the helm of the negro baptists the fact that king posed a threat to jacksons popularity was unquestioned a new day was dawning in the struggle for civil_rights and the technique of active protest was beginning to bear fruit and to capture the imagination of the nation king had done what no other negro had done up to this time he stood as the symbol of negro solidarity one of jacksons critics rev joseph kirkland of philadelphia stated in denver after listening to king jackson felt his power slipping from his grasp that plus the issue of tenure warned him that he was facing oblivion rev owen d pelt statistician of the convention and a long time jackson supporter rejected this type of thinking on the contrary he stated king merely echoed the philosophy that jackson had been preaching for years besides jackson was too intelligent to become a victim of petty jealousy whatever the reason the impact of king was sufficient enough to cause a groundswell toward new leadership the indecisive status of tenure helped to create the swell kings supporters recognizing the potential political power that he could exercise within the convention jockeyed him into position to compete for leadership the next year at the annual sunday school and btu congress kings name was offered in nomination for the vicepresidency of that body his popularity was made evident when all candidates for that office withdrew in his favor it was apparent to all that king was being groomed to take over the convention today neutral observers say it was unfortunate that king and jackson were thus pitted against each other many men who backed king were bitter fading ministers who feared that jackson would destroy their own ambitions for leadership the young supporters of king began a campaign against jackson on the charge that he was like uncle tom jacksons leadership was discredited as being weak on civil_rights and strong on dictatorship by the same token king came in for criticism his role many contended was too large to enable him to enter factional denominational considerations as a world renown figure he was diminishing his standing by playing the part of a conventional churchman he didnt need the convention nor did the convention need him in the years following jacksons reelection the conflict of philosophies concerning the struggle for human rights broke out even jacksonites were surprised when jackson allegedly made a statement condemning sitin demonstrations whereas there had always been supporters for jackson and supporters for king a third group of uncommitted ministers were able to view both men in perspectivejackson as a church man and king as a negro leader of the masses it was this third group that began to drift away from jackson jackson insisted that he was quoted out of context what he had really said he argued was that protest was not enough what still remains a mystery is why jackson had miscalculated the mood of the day the angry reaction that set upon him threatened to shake the foundation of his administration a progressive movement in the convention began to develop in the entire nation was caught up in the negro rebellion this was the mood of the day the negro church had entered the fray with enthusiasm it was against this backdrop that j h jackson began his own delayed program of freedom first he presented to the convention a plan to buy farmland in tennessee during the tent city crisis the purpose was to aid negro farmers in gaining independence from the white man this plan was labeled by the progressives as a booker t washington approach which history records as let down your buckets where you are his critics seized upon this new jackson venture with relish old man jackson has a farm they chanted it was ironic they contended that in an age of sitins wadeins and standins jackson dared to stage a farmin the next venture by dr jackson in support of his protest is not enough thesis was to export negro families to liberia to teach the people of that country by example how to live and farm as christians followers deserted him in droves as he seemed to focus his attention on farms rather than on the immediate problems of the day ironically jacksons proposals coming at any other time in history would have probably met with unanimous approval however with the intense struggle for civil_rights taking place and virtually no support from the jackson administration he was exhibiting a masterful flair for illtiming leadership was lying heavily upon his shoulders jackson fought hard to gain attention with steady lack of success in june he amplified his position on protest is not enough with his now famous address the american struggle in the american way this address was called by the progressives a masterpiece of tomism while the civil_rights movement shook up america the national baptist convention usa inc waited by july lunch counters had been integrated since the start of the sitins the convention waited while core opened its interracial training institute on nonviolence in miami florida nine southern states reported cities with integrated eating facilities in midaugust by this time martin_luther_king jrs name had become a household word the original idea of his assuming leadership in the conventional negro church was discarded his pulpit became every city that called upon him to inspire negro youth and to challenge the imbedded structure of segregation and discrimination defiantly he marched against police dogs and fire hoses with thousands behind him he was led time and time again to jail his appearance at any gathering electrified both the imagination and the aspiration of the negro masses as a statesman he had quietly ignored the rapierlike thrusts from his erstwhile rival at the same time jacksons lack of support for the revolution was not ignored by young progressive churchmen in every major city of the nation meetings were held alliances and strategy were formed and outlined a new battle cry was formulated jackson must go now dr gardner taylor preparing for the big push to oust jackson added his voice to those of the militants tomorrow libraries parks theaters will face the same choice integration or disintegration it appeared that time for the doctrine of patience had passed after successfully riding through his second fouryear term dr jackson prepared to make his stand for another term philadelphia the city of brotherly love was chosen as site of the next election the progressives conceding that jackson would run again searched for and found a new candidate gardner taylor pastor of the member concord baptist church brooklyn n y was their man like jackson he was a gifted orator and an attractive candidate some jackson supporters tried in vain to get taylor to withdraw as a candidate he was warned that if he was defeated his chance of ever becoming president was gone he was young they informed him he still had time let jackson have another four years taylors day would come gardner taylor was cast in the mold of a fighter he was the first negro member of the new york city board of education he was also the first negro president of the new york state council of ministers tall handsome and militant he was tailor made as a jackson opponent a major attraction was his identification with martin_luther_king jr by this time young king was the leader of the southern christian leadership conference the clamor for king as possible president of the convention had long since diminished prior to the annual session in philadelphia jackson and taylor skirmished briefly at the sunday school and btu congress once again jackson was expounding on his favorite theme patience as the delegates flocked to the new battlefield in philadelphia it soon became apparent that the taylorking forces were strong philadelphia was the political stronghold of rev marshall shepard former state legislator and recorder of deeds in washington d c shepard was an avid worker and arranger for taylor and he worked against jackson with a passion he had reason to jackson had disposed of him as chairman of the foreign mission board taylor was also supported by dr sandy ray president of the new york state convention these large eastern voting blocs far removed from jacksons political strongholds of the south and midwest were watched with deep anxiety by jackson supporters both sides immediately sought ground rules for the election the electoral procedure which had been customary was deplored by the taylor team this procedure worked in the following manner after the president would make his annual address a vicepresident would make a motion that the rules be suspended and the president would be reelected by acclamation the progressives claimed that this method was unfair undemocratic and had steamroller elements give all the delegates the right to cast ballots they contended and let their votes be recorded as they vote by states the agreement was made all delegates were informed that the election would be conducted by states the ground rules worked out by both parties likewise included an agreement that the nominating committee selected by the president would bring in two namestaylor and jacksonand the delegates would then vote for the man of their choice the taylor team was ready the jackson forces were waiting and the events that followed were almost unbelievable on tuesday contrary to the supposed agreement concerning the dual submission of names by the nominating committee the taylor forces were caught offguard when the committee reported only one name j h jackson moving quickly before the delegates could retain their balance the committee went on without asking for nominations from the floor they moved that their report be adopted with a unanimous vote for the reelection of jackson this maneuver must be viewed from two positions the body had voted earlier that the election would be by states and the report was made prior to the time of the schedule outmaneuvered and betrayed the taylor team resorted to the only means of protest leftbedlam we want taylor we want taylor they chanted in unison we want to vote and we want to vote by states they chorused someone cut the microphone cord jackson turning to the large choir ordered them to sing the chanting grew louder accompanied by the songs of the church churchmen were on a rampage jackson facing a dead microphone attempted to read his annual address and everyone knew that the election would follow this address sit down the taylor contingent shouted we dont want to hear you we want to vote and we want to vote by states they screamed in the middle of his opening statement the premature report of the nominating committee had set up the tempest it was clear to the taylor team what had to follow they moved to prevent it as jackson attempted to deliver his annual address a bass drum was brought in and taylor banners were marched behind the booming drum taylor balloons were released the president struggled to be heard but after a few sentences he realized the utter futility of going on and skipped to the end paragraph he read with a flourishbut it was unheard the coup de grace followed during the bedlam a motion was offered that the report of the nominating committee be received and adopted what followed this motion will never be clearly determined those who were standing close to the platform heard the motion and meanwhile the majority of the delegates were still shouting we want taylor remembering that the mike was dead and with the delegates in turmoil it was surprising to all when the news spread that jackson had been reelected alice dunnigan reporting the scene for the pittsburgh courier described the proceedings as follows the place was in such a hubbub that no one knew what was going on martin_luther_king approached the press table to inquire about the reelection of jackson he was startled when reporters sitting directly in front of the platform replied that there had been no election there must have been retorted king i just met rev jackson leaving the hall and he told me he just had been reelected this raised an inquiry among the reporters as to how and when the president had been elected when the news shifted back to the crowd that the election was over a jackson vicepresident was rapping the convention into adjournment until the evening session the angered taylorites increased the fervor of their demonstration it was at this point that jackson left the hall and notified king he had been reelected gardner taylor standing tall in the midst of his supporters yelled after jacksons retreating form the worst days of hitler never matched this if negroes stand for this they will let the world know they are not prepared for leadership but they will not stand for this they will have an election god help us prayed an old minister the taylorites with jackson gone moved quickly this meeting is not adjourned shouted dr sandy ray please hold your seats this meeting is not adjourned he repeated this over and over again we are going to have an election and were going to vote by states a roar of approval went up from the delegates jackson meanwhile had locked himself in his convention office reporters seeking to interview him were hustled off by his bodyguards alice dunnigan further reported some persistent reporters hung around the door and buttonholed the selfappointed president as he departed for his hotel he assured reporters that his election had been conducted legally under the terms of the conventions constitution he blamed dr marshall shepard the philadelphia counselman for the disorder implying that shepard had declined to keep order in the hall declaring that the city of brotherly love was the most inhospitable city in which the convention had ever met he stated that it would never come to philadelphia again as long as he was the president while jackson was making his declaratory statement the delegates were filing in arranging themselves by states and the convention was coming to order they were determined to have an orderly election rev c v johnson illinois state president and one of the national convention vice presidents was selected to conduct the election the election results were not surprising there were votes for taylor and for jackson the convention now had two presidents when the time for the evening session approached jackson entered the hall to preside taylor was standing beside him the police were called neither side would yield when the police inspector remarked that the situation was embarrassing to him one of the delegates yelled up to him if you had stayed out of here you wouldnt be embarrassed were baptists and we have a right to fight among ourselves without your help in spite of this brief moment of humor which was appreciated by both sides the wounds in the ranks of the negro baptists probed deep into the heart of its church the year found two men claiming the presidency the conclusion with elements of tragedy was consummated in kansas city kansas the next year the convention was called to order by dr jackson the taylor team had decided to fight through another medium the courts however the taylor contingent could not contain its anger while jackson was presiding disorder broke out it began when dr e c estell of dallas texas presented a resolution requesting jackson to allow his name to be voted on again as president of the convention stomping and yelling the taylor forces became so disorderly that the director of the auditorium begged the mayor of the city to appeal to the convention i am ashamed the mayor stated to know that you call yourselves christians you are bringing disgrace upon your city and upon your race the taylor forces went to court it was their intent to have a courtordered election with court supervision the court obliged it ordered that all delegates who had registered with both sides be recognized it ordered that dr d a holmes of kansas city supervise the election both sides agreed the orderly election that followed lasted until the early hours of the morning the final results were jackson votes and taylor the fire that burned in the convention had upset the church world the memory of the bitter struggle will never be forgotten in spite of the customary congratulations of the vanquished to the victor the ranks have never been closed the cuts were too deep negro baptists have formed a new convention and have discovered that the power struggle has caused irreputable harm in the meantime joseph harrison jackson stands at the helm of the majority without the obstacle of tenure which has never been reintroduced it is now predicted that he will remain there for life his enemies bitterly recall his concluding sentences in his controversial american struggle in the american way as christians we must accept and employ those methods that are just seasoned in love and based on the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of god the church cannot be used as a rubber stamp for every method employed in the name of democracy and freedom the church must not wait for others to begin a movement for human betterment the church is a revolutionary movement and gods prophets and gods ministers have historically been those who have come to turn the world upside down true his critics respond however even those words were directed against the militancy of the negroes who march toward freedom thus this nation has witnessed the dramatic performances of two men who in ordinary times would have made their marks in history without debatejackson with his ideas on production and king with his emphasis on creative protest however neither man lives in ordinary timesnor are they ordinary men their feud continues both in chicago and in the minds of negroes who have been further torn asunder by the new cry of black_power it remains for history to reveal which man and what instrument finally delivers the negro one thing is certain if the entire civil_rights movement could be cast as a play and produced in a theater that contained todays negroes both men would be standing in the wings to receive their accolades martin_luther_king jr without a doubt would receive a standing ovation joseph harrison jackson if granted one curtain call for his performance would undoubtedly bow to applause however feeble it is consistent with the i f colonial mindset to experiment on and tinker with the lives and fortunes of those who serve as the exploited when a fire breaks out and the house is burning down only the colonial mind could recommend the placing of whatever firefighting resources as are available on one corner of the back wall in order that we can learn to do at least one portion of the task as well as we possibly can yet such is the spirit of approaches to the massive needs of the urban poor through the sustained device of minuscule pilot projects in education and in employment it is consistent with a colonial mind which would build sustained weakness into urban life to launch a massive head start program for children when these same children must live in homes where fathers are not first equipped to provide the means of livelihood urban problems are rooted in the adult environment and not in the environment of children the experience of the best efforts at the reclamation of children has been that after a few months of academic success the weight of limitations of home life has placed the largest numbers back where they were but with the ingredient of added frustration churches which approach the problems of city life with programs for children do not get at the heart of the urban condition they waste money kill valuable time and come through in the long run as an affrontery to our urban minorities who while accepting often the proffered largesse perceive that the churches think of their needs in terms of the needs of children our churches have far too long shared in and augmented the colonialist mind which has spent and desecrated the resources of our cities our churches have failed to develop programs which build in the power and substantial interchange needed for urban rebuilding like colonialists generally they have perceived of their own kind as privileged they have seen the white clergy as fit to minister to urban minorities but have not built an equitable twoway street for the professionals of minorities to minister to those of the white sub urban majority the negro clergy long have chafed under a system of rank colonialism which sees the unspoken power of white people limit them to less than what their creator intended them in immediate terms to be one overriding fact should be clear we cannot be change agents unless we are willing to be changed ourselves what can our churches do to effect some measure of substantial regeneration in the life of our cities they may begin to recognize the unconscious burdens and predispositions of a colonial mindset which they bring to the concerns of urban life white people do not necessarily consciously seek to limit the lives of negroes yet the clear facts are that the force of their efforts in urban problem areas has been such that with increased interest the intensity of the problems of the black urban masses has increased for example housing and school segregation in the north has increased the dollar income gap between negroes and whites has increased school failures have spiralled negro males have progressively faired worse in relation both to white males and negro and white females thus placing greater strains upon negro family life the growing restlessness in our slums attests to the fact that things are acutely felt to be getting worse rather than better an america which sees the negro in terms of exploitation unconsciously exploits racism and exploitation of those who happen to be at the bottom of the social and economic pyramid are parts of our cultural pattern we are born into our colonialistminded culture and only as we are aware of its power and place in our lives can we become freer agents within our cultural setting this is an education task of major proportions to be undertaken within the white community itself we can recognize the need for power for selfdirected selfdevelopment on the part of those who inhabit our cities resources for urban rebuilding from without are wasted unless those who reside in our cities first are empowered for selfperpetuating improvement in the affairs of city life facilitation must therefore be given to the fullest development and expression of the latent power of the black urban masses bishop john bright of the african methodist episcopal church writes all of us know so well that power is merely to do things to move things to control things to direct to create to destroy the desire of negro america to get black_power is not to destroy america but to do great things for america to move america forward yes to control part of america like all other ethnic groups to help direct the affairs of america to be creative american citizens yes to destroy the bigots the social ills political ills the economic ills racial ills and to drive them from the shores of america our churches may work to encourage black pride black solidarity and promote a sense of the importance of the investment of black people in america white americans have worked to weaken the negro and to destroy his sense of worth if our cities are to be renewed programs in housing education employment and black solidarity need to be aggressively fostered some such programs are discussed in my black_power and urban unrest hawthorn books inc new york we can create mechanisms for authentic communication this is a basic and continuing need for all aspects of our national and globallife the development and refinement of such devices may well represent the greatest contribution to the common good which our generation may devise our churches can begin in this direction in such efforts on the urban scene we may focus upon the adult environment of our inner cities as representing the area of greatest need new vehicles for continuing openended adult education and retraining are needed throughout our society collegiatetype communityoriented educational reclamation and fulfillment institutions should be developed in a massive way and located foremost in the heart of every major negro community in america i have detailed elsewhere the broad implications of such an enterprise for many segments of the nations life this should represent the coming major educational thrust in america our churches may take a lead in seeing that this is done either those who reside in our urban slums are reclaimed and rehabilitated in terms of life and livelihood pursuits or they become an increasingly heavy deadweight to retard the forward development of our cities we must recognize that massive problems call for solutions of appropriate proportions our churches should work together wherever this is possible but the timidity colonialism or lack of vision of one or more denominations should not restrict the ready enterprise of others we must be open to change we must listen to negroes and accept their formal leadership not only in the vital area of urban affairs to which they hold the key but also in every other area of our common life our cities are in peril material resources of such massive proportions as suggested by the senate hearings on urban blight undoubtedly are greatly needed but alone such resources will not suffice the key element in urban regeneration is the human element as represented by the black urban masses their exploitationboth conscious and unconsciousmust cease at no place than in the life of our cities is the scriptural admonition more appropriate that he who would save his life must lose it only under such circumstances of clear and determined commitments in word and deed to human growth and fulfillment may there be any hope of enduringly effective urban evangelism once our unconscious and pervasive colonial mindset in regard to city life is cast aside the urban condition of increasingly ominous blight may be changed to that of largely selfdirected growth for good ver since black e t a m ericansforefap thers were technically freed from slavery there has existed a conflict as how best to come to terms with this whitedominated society stripped to its essentials the conflict has been between those who propose integration and those who propose ethnocentrism as a solution now for other minority groups these two solutions have not been incompatible america after all is a pluralist society and a study of the history of those minorities ie irish italian and jewish who have made it clearly indicates that the growth of ethnic separatism is a precondition for eventual penetration into ruling circles and full economic integration theoretically then there is no good reason why most black americans should not be able to live simultaneouslyas most white americans doin two worlds one integrated and the other for the most part separated however in practice the black man has not been able to live in the best of the two worlds and the main reason that this conflict this unnatural division in our ranksis still with us is that white people through their institutions labor unions foundations the press local and federal governments etc have taken sides with the integrationists discrediting black ethnocentrism they have shoved forward the integrationists as the responsible black leaders mesmerized by white acceptance and ignoring history the integrationists have failed to see the need to develop their own communities as a base of power they have urged black people to submerge their unorganized numbers in coalitions dominated by other organized groups and they have urged black people to disperse themselves in white communities not realizing that a people have to know who we is before they can start effectively dealing with them and they they have not realized that first you consolidate then you integrate until recently the ethnocen trists organizations have not been able to compete on an equal basis with the integrationists organizations unable to get money and acceptance from white institutions ironically the ethnocentrists have been unable to attract those black people with the skills necessary to carry out their programs while generally the ethnocentrists organizations have been wellmeaning for instance the muslims they have most often been simply ineffective thus instead of having two equals complementing each other an imbalance has occurred however with the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc and the congress of racial equality core embracing black_powera more poetic way of saying ethnocentrismthe necessary balance is being created that is why their presence on the scene is such a healthy sign it is one thing for the naacp to pit itself against the muslims and yet another thing for it to pit itself against core core like sncc has left the civil_rights movement to join the negro movement the volatile sncc with its charismatic stokely carmichael the pragmatic core with its phlegmatic floyd mckissick while core no longer has the white beatnik image it had during the early sixties it is still in a period of transition there is about it that mixture of audacity and ambivalence which accompanies each whats a black revolution why simply stated it means a renaissance a new awakening of the black conscience its black_power the securing of the necessary power to change our lives and to decide what we want for ourselves the black revolution is a force for good a force for change the black revolution has six goals economic power more and better jobs an improved selfimage for the black man development of a militant intelligent educated and dedicated leadership political power enforcement of federal laws that protect the rights of all men and abolition of those laws that are used to punish people because they are black consumer power the development of a black consumer block to be used against those commercial forces who fail to recognize black people employ them and fail to give them franchise core has members in chapters scattered all over the country it is ruled by the national convention which meets annually and is composed of representatives from the various local chapters virtually autonomous the local chapters form cores real strength and give it the flexibility that a national organization needs for although black people form a distinct group in this country with similar problems housing education employment police brutality lack of capital etc the intensity and refinement of these problems vary from one part of the country to another in harlem one of the problems is that black people do not really own any property residential or business but this might not be true of black people in atlanta or chicago also black people in one region of the country might be further along in their development obviously the southern black man has a keener sense of community and is less apathetic than the northern black man additionally in one city it might be feasible for black people to ally themselves with democrats in another it might be in their best interest to side with republicans and in another it might be best to act independent of either party by virtue of its independence each local chapter is able to decide which problems will be attacked first of course having autonomous local chapters can also create difficulties for it places a strain on the national office in terms of overall strategy and programs this means that the national director must have that special quality of being able to follow and lead at the same time mckissicks whole life seems to have been a preparation for this job mckissick was influenced by two ministers one a methodist the other a baptistboth were my grandfathers he smiles both were great talkers and i used to listen to them they talked about things like the inalienable rights of men and mans right to be free subjects like that from listening to them i began to develop my own philosophy and there was also the inner security that comes from parents love his father a jack of all trades worked at such jobs as bellhop and waiter before becoming an insurance salesman his mother worked as a cashier for him to have become a school teacher would no doubt have utterly pleased them both during world war ii he married and served in europe as a technical sergeant after the war he returned to the campus to complete his education he attended morehouse college where he met martin l king jr got to know whitney young then at atlanta university and the legendary sugarfoot the boston celtics sam jones when both attended north carolina college he joined his first protest group during this period the fellowship of reconciliation a group to which bayard rustin also belonged his apprenticeship included participation in numerous sitins picket lines and other demonstrations long before they became camp mckissick also joined the naacp and served as the north carolina youth director in mckissick achieved national recognition by becoming the first black student to graduate from the university of north carolina law school if the harassment he underwent at the university of north carolina dead frogs in his room water in his locker and a live snake in his bed was not a matter of public record one could imagine him going to law school simply to save money from lawyers fees for his whole family has been in jail and his childrenjoycelyn andree floyd jr and charmainwere the first black children to attend white elementary junior high and high school in durham n c in fact the mckissick family is almost totally involved in the movement a conversation that begins with mckissick at the office may be completed at the dinner table where the family has gathered the mckissick family lives uptown harlem in a home that is comfortable without being pretentious guests are entertained downstairs in an elongated room whose one excess is the huge mahogany desk from behind which mckissick presides directly behind the desk looms a fireplace to the left a bookcase and to the right a banner with large bold letters proclaiming black_power one evening simply by chance a rare occurrence movement peopie letting their hair down and talking about the movement as if an outsider was not present we had come to dinner with bob gore and later found ourselves with ruth turner and mckissicks eldest daughter joycelyn bob bought a fifth of bourbon mckissick acted as the disc jockey and played his favorite s bessie smith jimmy reed tampa red lightnin hopkins leadbelly lulu reed slowly names of towns like danville wilmington and charlotte and names of people like bo johnson williams johnny and spike filled the room grim southern apparitions emerging from the past who seemed so at home in harlem oh daddy you remember spike remember he was the one who always wanted to be first in line remember hey floyd man how about that time in danville remember what that cracker sheriff said boy that sure was a mean cracker yeah and johnny you remember johnny he used to sing all the time what ever happened to him johnny johnny simpson yea thats him what ever happened to him i dont know you know he was never the same after they whipped him that last time never the same ill never forget the way he looked when he first came out of the hospital but in a way i guess he was lucky remember what they did to bo when the evening is finished the outsider is filled with so many questions what manner of men are these movement people outnumbered by their opposition and all but unknown by the very people for whom they fight what inner force sustains them but when the evening ends there is a sense of relief too around true believers there is not much comfort for the outsider besides there is something disquieting in being confronted with the knowledge that your people are in a real war with real blood being spilled and you have been but a spectator days later back at the national office mckissick who travels a lot and often works late in the night nods until there is talk of black_power and its effects upon core then his dark eyes become alert and his mind alive he discusses the new core black people began to control core in prior to that the national board was predominantly white now only one white person serves on the board so in a sense core has been moving towards black_power for some time causing many whites to leave the organization however they are being quickly replaced by black people who are attracted to core because of its black_power stance and cores membership is actually increasing but with core fast becoming a black organization a money problem has been created the various foundations as they have done so often in the past have again taken sides they give their money to the urban league and the naacp in terms of program black_power has forced core to gravitate towards those with the greatest needs the black poor core has become involved in programs like the grand marie project in louisiana a sweet potato cooperative and has helped to elect several black people to political office in louisiana mississippi and georgia in baltimore there is the quite successful target city project a program geared to organize black people into effective economic and political power blocs demonstrations are no longer the only weapon used by core and while cores basic philosophy has not changed it is aimed more directly toward aiding and involving black people of course the slogan black_power does raise some larger questions of tactics and timing there is such a thing as italian power jewish power irish power anglosaxon protestant power etc and that it is not perpetuated by chance nor specifically ordained by god on a national level anglosaxon protestants control the military communications media political and bankingindustrial institutions further in new york city the jews control education the italians control construction and the irish control the police between them the jews and italians split the clothing industry night clubs and entertainment and the rackets therefore there also is a need for black people to have power but while one can agree with the concept of black_power one can still question the slogan black_power itself other groups do not talk about their power they practice it once a group really has power there is little need to refer to it by its brand name nor is it good tactics to tell your plans to your opponent and sometimes to tell the truth is poor politics mckissick argues that black_power is like a slogan that sells a product and that black_power is meant to be a dialogue between black people but is it really selling the product and how would it have been if the slogan black_power had been allowed to develop in the black community like the word soul the same general arguments used against black_power can be used against soul it is racist it does more harm than good since you always have to explain and define it it isolates black people from the mainstream etc ad nauseum however the term soul was allowed to develop in the black community black people did not first learn about it on tv or read it in the papers it was theirs for years before whites were aware of it time however might work in favor of the term black_power for black_power implies an awareness that other groups have power and in this sense it is a realistic appraisal of components of the power structure america has a great capacity for absorption and soon black_power will join other poetic expressions soulful groovey hip funky square swinging etc that blacks have coined and contributed to the language already there is talk of green power mckissick is aware of all this he realizes that one can be used on television while attempting to use it and already he speaks of limiting his television appearances organizing the black community will be tedious and unglamourous and there are no short cuts for the hard work involved when asked the direction that core will take in the future he cited the six goals of the black revolution refusing to be more specific he smiled and said its time for a lot of moving without saying too much it is as if he has felt the times pulse for the movement has had its verbal orgies the time for shouting deprecations against the white man has come and gone now is the time for getting together quietly and doing what must be done without a doubt there does exist among us a generation of black people who exude an ineffable air of selfappreciation black consciousness ethnocentrism nationalism negritudeby whatever name it exists whether labeled or not cores ability to significantly involve this group will be one of its major tests for it is a lonely restless generation of nonbelievers looking for a new faith a generation compelled to act even though dramas have not yet been written for it however if core is to survive and remain true to the tenets of black_power it must be financed by black people most of the money must come from the black middle class and this will be cores other major test as long as core was a civil_rights organization money was not the real problem but as we mentioned above cores stance on black_power has alienated a sizable number of white people and while its membership has actually increased its dollar intake has decreased thus core is faced with the complicated task of drawing upon two distinct groups for its support the one militant but undisciplined the other financially stable but politically conservative and acquisitive never having demonstrated in its entire history any interest in supporting black institutions it will be a tough row to hoe if core favors the militants it risks losing the conservatives and hence its financial support if it favors the conservatives it risks losing the militants and its position in the avantgarde additionally there is the opposition that will come from the white community and the integrationists who will be vying with core for the support of the black masses but floyd mckissick seems the man for the job since he has become national director he has shifted the direction of core as well as its location and when mckissick speaks of a black revolution and says that the civil_rights movement is deader than a door knob we know he exaggerates not from arrogance but to make us begin thinking of ourselves not as we are but as we can be home black inlectuals the gen eration is changing come home black intellectuals the white mans conditioning of black minds is cracking at the seams come home black intellectuals recondition the young to drive for maximum effort in the development of their minds come home black intellectuals and help reeducate and reorient your people come home black intellectuals before you are relegated to that sterile eternity the historical footnote the generation is changing and the negro intellectual who in many instances seems a pale copy of his white counterpart can no longer play at being white by imitating the white mans culture in every way which is often so alien to the negro mind the negro intellectual who should be the leader among his people must turn within and seek those positive and constructive things about himself and his people and build his and his own peoplesself respect for the newlyawakened generation does not accept many of the standards of the white culture as being the only good and right patterns of human behavior the newlyawakened black generation is bent on establishing itself as a vital and moving force in american society not under the enlightened leadership of whites or under the leadership of puppet negro leaders who dance at the ends of oligarchic strings which control them the conditioning of the negro mind has for over years deprived him of his manhood and individuality but with each succeeding generation the degree of conditioning has lessened moreover the authoritarian personality structure of the american white male and the negro female which has in the past operated to reinforce and sustain submission is on the wane traditionally these personality structures only allowed for the most part the more conservative negro leadership however with the young negro generation of today this kind of leadership will not be tolerated for it has cast aside the humble withdrawn role of the negro for the role of a man in his own right many of the rearguard conservative negro intellectuals today comprise much of the negro middle class which generally has tried to remove itself from the negro masses as a consequence of this selfimposed removal the demand for leadership among negroes for negroes has brought forth a group of leaders of a less welleducated and less sophisticated character such a development cannot just be said to be bad for the negro but tragic it would seem that the negro intellectuals duty is to do some deep soulsearching and to remove himself from his comfortable middleclass niche and render unto his people for the present generation of negroes and those to come will be less conditioned to a white standard of beauty to a white standard of good and bad to a white standard of culture where these standards find their authority for action based on a whitedefined christian religion which identifies white as purity and good black as base and foul the negro intellectual must be reminded that among the young negro females it is no longer a point of pride to have a white mans child or one as mixed and nearwhite as possible they have realized that to desire such a thing is an admission of selfimposed inferiority and leads to degrees of selfhate the negro intellectual must be reminded that he has indeed been out of contact with niggertown desperately running from the black culture that gave him life the negro intellectual must be reminded that only the strong have endured from his african parentage that the conditions under which his forebears endured did not permit the weak to survive the negro intellectual must be reminded that though the traditional conditioning and brain washing practices of the white majority have been formidable they could little have changed nor reversed the process of nature once set in motion short of complete extermination of the negro in this country finally the negro intellectual must be reminded that if he does not recognize these practices and processes and reassume leadership his leadership will become something out of time and date negro intellectuals have for years stepped around the problem of the mothercentered organization of many lower class negro families in a culture which sustains a fathercentered system negro intellectuals have failed their people relative to the disadvantageous position of the negro male as family man the fact that divorce laws may be just in a white culture does not make them just for negroes when family organization among many negroes is the reverse of that of most whites especially when the negro males ability to exploit opportunities in the job market is not equal even to that of many negro females and the sad part of this entire pattern has been the negro intellectuals refusal to point out to both the negro and to whites that the negro females improved opportunities have existed alone because of the white mans peculiar relationship to her but the nonintellectual black male recognizing this problem on his own level has dealt with it in a crude destructive but effective manner witness the high divorce rate among negroes witness the degree of welfare support to fatherless families witness the high degree of illegitimacy witness the gross disrespect for females by many males of the lower class the negro intellectual must be reminded that this is perhaps the first generation in which the negro male is bent on assuming his posture as a man and that the nature of the family unit may well be the cause of the new rationale he is well aware of his proscribed position in american society he sees christian society operated seemingly alone for white people he has witnessed numbers of his women sell out their own people at the expense of the negro males selfimage he realizes he must defend a country that seemingly still is bent upon using his black back as a work horse and he is aware of the fact that the white man fears the black males acquisition of power because of the degraded place assigned to black males throughout american history finally he is aware of the fact that the white man has sold himself a sense of superiority which when lost causes great mental difficulty for him small wonder that the young negro generation seems committed to either complete emancipation or destruction negro intellectuals should not forget that it is they who have helped to reinforce the opinion that there is nothing worse than an educated fool they should not forget that it is they who have allowed the attitude that motherwit and common sense are to be valued over trained intellect and competency in trade or professsion they should be reminded that the young generation is little interested in turning the other cheek or mumbling prayers to heaven for deliverance but is belching expletives and bent on their own selfdeliverance by whatever means are possible come home black intellectuals for the brutal fact of life in this midtwentieth century is that the world today is a world given over to racism it does not matter practically speaking whethor not it is right or wrong it does not matter practically speaking if it is against the laws of god it does not matter practically speaking if there are mountains of evidence that there are no great differences in the native potentials of the three major divisions of human stock come home black intellectuals for what does matter in the here and now is that racism is on the ascendency racism is like a religion a belief this is a fact of life which the american negro is going to have to learn to live with moreover it is not likely that racism will be eradicated from the minds of men in the next few decades or tens of decades for that matter come home black intellectuals and help your people seek out their strong points and build a reservoir of pride and self respect come home black intellectuals and be examples for the negros survival in the age of automation may rest on nothing less than allaround superior performance come home black intellectuals ralph waldo el lison a psychologically sound type of the literarywise who soar but seldom roam holds that there is an argument in progress between black men and white men as to the true nature of american reality indeed neither literary overseers academic elihus nor ethopiam eunuchsall of whom now circulate freely through establishment platforms have known quite what to make of invisible man mainly because the narratorprotagonist who sets the course of this achievement in fictional variety and verisimilitude is still in the making for whatever its shortcomings ellisons creation is as omificent as anything the modern american novel has produced it is one thing moreover for those presuming to pit life against death to lie down in freudian darkness and set up in glib print it is quite another duly to observe and yet dwell apart from cesspoolbased geysers of pathological obsessions and mock dialogues for ellison and for a good halfdozen other natural sons who happen at once to be novelists and american negroesand even this latter by fiat of the pathology of syncrisisthe essential reality of the human condition reaches beyond the version of those david daiches see his english literature has justly appraised as fools and freaks hence if through the process that the american novel in the main has become it has degenerated into an imageblurring mirror of nihilistic negations or the american stage excepting arthur miller and the late lorraine hansberry into a reptile house of sickness and shrieking projections the condition can hardly be charged against the negro novelist in his right state beginning at the same scripture he is philip reading nor can the noble tradition of folk simplicity and assertive dignity from which those of trombone timbre as distinguished from that of tamborine neuroses yet draw be done to death the test of a living literature is surely not how often or widely an establishmentlaunched name is dropped orbited and echoed by jamesian scribes but whether its character creations walk in the light of our time for all time and for any fruitful purpose it may well be as chairman of the bookofthemonth club harry sherman contends that the judges of the y earoldcorporatepatrondistributor consider themselves truly representative of the general public and not apprehensive of the possible unpopularity the presumed unacceptability of any book it may even be that they have read themselves into the state of blessedness which he claims for them and drawn their many millions of the top layers on the qui vive intellectually unto them this much they have proved on the merit of invisible man and on the canon of diverse quality novels which during the sleepy fifties confirmed the arrival in american letters of a big four among negro novelists they were either insensitive or silent the intense and naturally balanced interplay of comic touch and tragic reality evident in the best of chester himes cast the first stone and the third generation in ann petrys wise and comprehensive treatment of tragic love cutting across lines of class and race to be climaxed by a clash of pride the narrows and in those euripidean pillars of the unshakable wright foundation the outsider and the long dream cannot be honestly bypassed nor can such a supporting cast of fleshed and spirited images read into the record through mark kennedys the pecking order john oliver killens youngblood and julian mayfields the hit these novels simply cannot be disposed of by packaging them in superficial surveys warmed over after serving their original purpose as exercises in ph d dissertation writing the logical fruit of this routine mistreatment of some of the most penetrating and permanent writing of the decade immediately behind us is threefold having been led away from it the american clerisy was left without lenses to see the blood on the moon that was to stream down into the streets granted that the relationship between huck finn and nigger jim like that between wolsey and cromwell in shakespeare is a sympathetic portrait and cherished memory but far more lovely and meaningful is that between link williams and camilla treadway sheffield in ann petrys remarkable reworking of the theme central to romeo and juliet and cyrano de bergerac yet it has never occurred to american critics to recognize miss petrys vision as independent of their guidance and control and wherever the negro artist has indicated his unwillingness to serve and preserve their psychological and economic comfort he has been read out of circulation he may of course share fully in their pathological distresses but a seat among the outpatients of the henry james institute of hidden meanings is not to be equated with a place of reasonable comfort next door in fair housing philip the reader moreover is not for bending double in compromise alienation or dense actuality the real contradictions of a life he elects to face are sufficient for his purposes and bearing their reality with their revelations negroes have always lived close enough to privilege to work fight and die in the service of owners or overseers the question now a positive answer to which would certainly clarify if not settle the matter at issue in the human rights revolution on the home front is put from a rooftop response two thousand years after peter by b j the little demon leader in the pecking order anybody kin work fer white folks its livin with um that counts hence if the criticsclerisy eyes be closed arrogant or evil in the reading of literature by negro americans how shall human understanding hearts and houses be opened how else can the american credo be fulfilled or american literature and art be free henry fielding declared himself out not to make bad men good but to make good men wise the stray fruit of criticsclerisy rejection of the negro in literary life reality is expatriation half of americas talented native sons who seek life in creative expression are currently living and dying in old and alien lands himes and mayfield are overseas and death came to wright and willard motley in france and mexico respectively even from these outposts however leopold senghors recent defense and definition of their mission and their poetry the defense and illustration of negritude has held true for it is a gusher that does not run dry a basic significant element of the civilization of the universal which is being constructed before our eyes by us and for us by all and for all a classic example of this is a singularly significant redwood among the tall timbers of american reality fiction the long dream that has been both mistaken and maligned it is nevertheless the essential key to an understanding of two continuously troublesome problems in the coarse texture and strangled style of ghetto existence negro family life and the negros relationship to the law and given the living holocaust in natchez mississippi as of april which furnished the springboard substance and framework of this misread and bypassed novel no meaningful commentary reportorial or testimonial about root causes of the crises in either our cities or our families can fail to reckon with the disturbing truth it reveals but the sustained irony of the long dream is that its portrait of integrated roguery in blackandwhite has leaped from its pages into the streets and courts of our big cities and naturally beyond the projects of an academic bourgeoise of intellectual posture psychsociological bent and hustling ambition the strange fruit of critics clerisy rejection of lifesize negroes in literature is the kind of marketplace the situation has produced shored up by public ignorance apathy and fear in negrowhite relationships in america a cynical and telepathetic alliance links the widely advertised moynihan report journalist theodore h whites pontifical essays on negroes and hollywoods subtly altered version of the late edward lewis wallants the pawnbroker which went to the moviegoing public with black brock peters in the criminal overlord role the novelist assigned to a sicilian one need only set the above three in juxtaposition to the case of william manchester who wrote about a wealthy and important family and an issue of highest importance to see the helplessness of a people without due recognition in life literature and law a public informed by the best that is in negro literature could not be so misled what the literature of america by its natural sons needs perhaps is a disinterested appraisal such as a david daiches or dennis brogan would be capable of providing the dilemma in american life was not ably diagnosed until gunnar myrdal pulled together what really mattered and wrote a commentary that made sense if it did not make converts to be sure maxwell geismar and lewis mumford have since the sixties begun to challenge the current chaos to return to reality and order or john steinbeck at stockholm delivered the address for our health and recovery but these voices are likewise an overlooked minority one rather significant multiple offense by other house members has been overlooked during efforts to disqualify a colleague adam clayton powell for defiance of the courts no one even tried to reprimand the representatives who with senators had signed the march southern manifesto that document defied the supreme courts unanimous school segregation decision and initiated a sweeping campaign to dignify defiance of the federal judiciary that has left a bitter heritage its signers were seated without question just a decade ago a moderate education editor recently reported that the nations schools are more separate and less equal than they were years ago last may commissioner of education harold howe ii is second only to representative powell as a target of congressional wrath as he steers an uncertain course in enforcing the civil_rights act the southern manifesto itself is fast fading from memory but its effect in inciting disobedience to law lives on when we call on southern officials for compliance they just laugh at us one federal aide is reported to have said in the aftermath of the civil war there had been a precarious balance between bitterness and submission on the part of the white south as eric mckitrick has said carl schurz an officially commissioned observer whose report was ignored ruefully concluded that the opportunity had been lost as soon as president andrew johnson permitted it to be understood that he purposed to restore those states to their selfgoverning functions without preparation the stillexisting proslavery spirit was naturally flushed with new hope the precarious balance reappeared after the school segregation decision senator russell long said at first although i completely disagree with the decision my oath of office requires me to accept it as law the border states prepared to obey the law such groups as the southern regional council called for action by community leaders to prepare for compliance former virginia senator benjamin muse reported desegregation might have been accomplised in many localities before resistance had hardened and it might have forestalled some organized harassment all such hopes were dashed when the southern declaration of constitutional principles was released the apostles of bitterness had overwhelmed the forces that were organizing to encourage respect for law calling the supreme courts decision an abuse of judicial power the congressional signers of the manifesto pledged an unremitting fight against the ruling while the document cautioned against disorder and lawless acts its true meaning was as anthony lewis wrote to make defiance of the supreme court and the constitution socially acceptable in the southto give resistance to the law the approval of the southern establishment the effect on the constitutional rights of millions of our children has been incalculable few in congress gave the manifesto the name it deserved senator clifford case deplored its tendency to incite resistance and oregons richard neuberger declared it underminded the rule of law senator humphrey feared that persistence in denial of equal rights would arouse world indignation but according to william s white disclaimed any intention to admonish his southern friends it remained for salty old pat macnamara to stand up and say this declaration may not be outright sedition but it certainly is subversive in its intent to undermine the integrity of the judicial system of this nation the new house includes of the representatives who signed the manifesto they are hardly fit to help determine if cavalier contempt for the law is enough to warrant exclusion of an elected member several years ago as a negro living in the south i had feelings of grandeur about what the north was like i had been told that it was truly the land of opportunity freedom and wholesome living with those preconceived notions i came north to explore this earthly heaven for myself i have been here five years have watched with great concern and objectivity the conditions have been involved first hand in the social movements and now i have made a decision about where i want to spend the remainder of my life that decision is in the south there are definite reasons why to be very honest i do believe the north offers greater opportunities and more freedom than the south but all this seems to be misinterpreted by my negro brother the negro in the north seems to view all of this as an achievement end rather than an achieving means since most northern negroes have come from the south by comparison they naturally see the north as superior this seems to create a feeling of having it made the result is appalling apathy negro communities in the north that could be operating at and per cent efficiency are operating at and per cent efficiency because so few really sense the need yet in the south there are negro communities operating at and per cent efficiency while their size structure and pressure would seem to indicate a much smaller percentage the negro in the south knows what has to be done he knows what he has to do he knows that he cannot afford to put his hand to the plow and look back so he keeps plowing what should be of paramount concern to all of us is the kind of future we can look forward to frankly unless things change i have grave skepticism about the future of the negro in the north this is primarily because of his apathy at best the situation now is critical the schools are overcrowded in many systems there are double shifts and there are teenage gangs and more gangs what really disturbs me is that there does not appear to be any cure in sight much of this is brought about because enough interest and concern cannot be generated to pass bond referendums to finance new schools as is the procedure in the midwestern metropolis in which i now live then too many school districts overlap thereby making enemies of property owners against bond referendums because they see the measures as a continuing process and continuing expense about the gangs i wish i could say a good word but one would be hard to find knifings shootings and killings are constantly occuring and all of this is on the increase the gangs are well organized and there are ranks for all members it has been reported that one of the best ways to move up is by inflicting injury and in some cases murder the gangs have just about taken over in the north based upon the pace they are now setting five years will find the north an unsafe place to walk the streets under these conditions i would not be giving my children a fair chance for wholesome survival if i stayed in the north i know the south has its segregated schools but that system is breaking and my knowledge of the south tells me that the break will be solid here again overcrowdedness is not a major problem in the public schools of the south because schools are built with state funds whenever the need arises i know there are gangs in the south but they dont exist to inflict injury and murder is virtually unheard of among teenagers there i also believe a greater sense of value is placed upon human life by negroes in the south this is definitely lacking in the north and perhaps explains why the teenage gangs in the north are so violent more important i believe the negro in the south has a better sense of direction than the negro in the north primarily because he sees the south as a challenge to his ends therefore there is a greater spirit of togetherness it has been said that the most important gift one can have is a sense of perspective and duty im going back to the south because i want to keep that gift what power is there in christianity to wean men from race prejudice wrote kelly miller the howard university sociologist early in this century in mandate for white christians john knox press kyle haselden returns to this question which whether asked in simplicity or irony has lost none of its impact for many of those most passionately concerned with combating racial injustice christianity has become a handy synonym for hypocrisy it would be sad if this attitude lost mr haselden some readers among people who would appreciate him most a pastor for many years and currently editor of the christian century and the pulpit he is a serious christian a man who does not shirk the moral implications of his religion or deny that it has been distorted by the uses to which its professors put it christian religious practice has always been a mirror of events never a touchstone of rectitude historians and sociologists can find a key to the special hypocrisies of a period by taking a careful look at what the churches have not stressed the mandate presented to white christians in america troubled as they must be by the failure of their churches as a whole to take a stand on the moral issues of race relations is simple mr haselden recommends christian love in six coherently expressed chapters he presents a remarkably balanced analysis of the complexity of the religious attitudes of white christians the overt bigotry of some christians is not denied but the author is more concerned with guilt by dissociation from the moral issues of racial injustice he writes of the element of coercion in martin_luther_king jrs policy of nonviolence and believes that this coercive element the technique of shaming ones adversary by love is the one that will eventually be effective not surprisingly dr_king has written an appreciative foreword christian love says mr haselden knows no limit in its pursuit of justice he quotes pascalbecause men do not fortify justice they justify forceto bring home the consequences of a failure of this love one such consequence being the practice of scapegoating the temptation to make whipping boys out of symbolic figures like george wallace bull connor and benjamin willis does not absolve those of us whose crimes are less obvious christian love says mr haselden whose intellectual brilliance lights up some carefully shaded recesses of our consciences does not rejoice in the evil that it discovers in men but guilt does there is no way for a white christian to avoid the burden of personal responsibility for the failure of his church or the compromises of his own science mandate for white christians faces the facts but does not in turn fall into the trap of making a scapegoat of the church a white christian need not look beyond the basic tenets of his faith to find a solution to the problem of how to live with his black brother mr haseldens book honest thoughtful and unemotional may help negroes to understand the apparent ambiguity of the white mans attitudes towards them as well as doing something to modify those attitudes in the light of rationality and love evening lay in figueroa street with the sky purpling overhead ernie and i walked along saying little and watching the cars and the street we passed a tuxedo shop the lights in the back off and a dummy in the display window wore an after five jacket that i couldnt afford we turned at the corner into a liquor store coolness was inside and the room was well lighted two men stood behind the counter one white with a large bald head and a negro who looked like a postal clerk whatta ya drink man ernie asked wine the store was filled with customers little black spindlylegged kids getting sodas and koolaid older girls waited in line for cigarettes holding cokes and popping gum in their wide mouths cmon step on up the bald man said the other man acted as cashier unless there was a bill larger than a five to cash the largeheaded man stood beside the cash register and looked over the others shoulder thats five sixteen and twentysix for the cigarettes and that makes fortysevan

behind us you want to try it boy he said im goin ta call the police the black man said moving away from the counter and edging toward the back a man in grey denims stepped up and stood beside ernie and me i saw what happened saul he said to the bald man you provoked these hare boys the white man lowered the gun and pointed his finger at the new mans very dark face wait a minute johnson now johnson this aint none of your business the negro clerk said looking afraid to go in back now or to use the telephone on the counter johnson didnt seem to hear them but turned to ernie and me why dont you fellahs go someplace else this mans gonna put ya in trouble he said indicating the bald man with a nod with his free hand on the cash register and the other dropped below the counter clutching the pistol the fat man stood as far away from the counter as possible he and the negro almost huddled in the same spot you better get rid of that there gun the black man in denims told him the bald man removed his hand from the cash register and then showed his now empty handjohnson you been a customer of mine for over ten years and if you really seen what had gone on you wouldnt be stickin your nose in here these boys are probably gettin ready to rob me sonna ernie tried to get past johnson but johnson blocked him from touching the counter and i held his arms take yo finger out of my face johnson said when the bald man lifted his hand to shield himself now johnson the negro clerk began shut up you hear me talkin to yo boss i pulled ernies sleeve and we both turned silently and walked out the door pushing the crowd in front but ernie screamed one last remark over his shoulder from inside the store the last thing i heard was the storekeeper asking johnson why johnson could call us boys and he couldnt jfc d around two as we passed the liquor store we paused at the corner for the light we watched the girl in pink capris drinking a red soda she and the bald man leaned at the far end of the counter next to the window her pink tongue played in the bottle opening spitting air into the container and plugging the liquid in the end then she would jerk the bottle down swishing the last of the beverage around in the bottom though leaving her tongue tip out pointing redly and moist at the store owner he leaned over the counter the neon coke signs flashing upon his forehead in the store the other clerk closed and locked doors and emptied trash and swept the floor alxander held the n big box carefully in his hand the subway trin win in s way towards the brooklyn bridge he tried to control the twitching of his left arm he couldnt oh god he said softly to himself if i drop it now but he couldnt think of this no he would have to force himself to forget this box and the jarring jerking movements of the train and too he would have to forget that he was alone and would be even more so after he got to the bridge if only some of the others had come with him but no they wouldnt maybe they would go to the man yes this is what would happen didnt he know negroes that is know that they couldnt be depended uponthat they would shy away from the real mccoy yes this was true and he despised them for it but that was all right he could do it alone if only he could stop thinking about it yes because if his hands kept trembling he might accidentally let go of the box and then it would all be over then and there but suppose he was to get another headache like those which came sometimes to explode his temples into flames suppose this was to happen and suddenly without even knowing it he was to black out no he couldnt think about that either better to think about something else perhaps tomorrow but there too was a dead end tomorrow had always had its drawbacks for him living in the south and forced to walk the thin line between the expedient and the impossible and always aware that there was a real physical force which could with one thought simply on a hunch or a whim smash him at its will had made all of his tomorrows todays and yesterdays no better not think about tomorrow there were none for negroes it was all a myth all of their days were similar they were a timeless people but he had to think about something anything except this box and this train and what would happen after he got to the bridge yes anything but that perhaps then he should think about his father what would his father say now if he were alive and if he could see him on this journey his father would approve he knew that is of the journey and of the need for what had to be done but would his father approve of his doing it he didnt know he had been proud of his father and ofttimes before he would go out to seventh avenue to get up on the stand and speak to the people he would look at his fathers picture and recall those sundays he had sone down to the vacant lot beside bens poolroom and listened to his father speak he recalled that sad pitiful old man waving his arms and banging the wooden rostrum with his bony fists and he recalled too the sound of that voice the hatred which came with the spittle from his lips and the epithets which he aimed at his motley emotional audience the audience tired old men and young bewildered boys had shouted and cheered and sometimes brandished their fists in the air in response to his cajoling for that moment perhaps they were stirred moved made conscious of the futility of their daily existence but this spell could not long remain they had not been revolutionaries but plain simple people who knew only one thing about the class struggle that somehow they were in it and got the worse of it and that it would never be any different and true his father had had no real solution perhaps he had been rightthat is in his own mind perhaps communism was the wave of the future perhaps there in the s at the height of the new deal during the great liberal administration of franklin d roosevelt when one negro was being lynched every week and each negro child was destined to a mental if not physical death by the age of yes perhaps communism or any ism was the answer but his fathers audience these ignorant people had been wiser than their mentor they had seen in the violent revolution not the eventual victory of the proletariat but instead the victory of the power structure which would after a decisive victory go on to emulate the germans and exterminate negroes indiscriminately en masse and they had seen too that there was growing within all of this chaos and disruption a negro bourgeoisie which would dedicate itself to maintaining the status quo and no matter how much they too despised the negro middle class the ones with the fine homes and the big carsthey also on the other hand sought to emulate them and they dreamed of the day when they might be like them and so his father had been defeated because of the inability of his audience to believe after they had left the power of his oratory that the world painted by his words was the real one he was glad that his father had died early he knew that had he lived he would have eventually gone insane or cut his throat yes he believed this because his father was an intellectual and the negro intellectual at some stage of his life is forced to give up his illusions part with his ideals desert the world of mysticism and become immersed in the pragmatic world of harsh cold reality always he walks the thin line between sanity and insanity seeing death not as an awesome antagonist but perhaps as a more comforting alternative to him reality is not that which inspires but instead that which defeats that which pushes one willingly hopefully to his own destruction yes better that his father had died before the death of his illusions better that he had died before he had come to realize that the new day would never be yes he had died at the right timethe train came to a halt at fiftyninth street the sudden stop threw him back against the seat his hand relaxed and the box began to slide down his thigh his eyes opened wide and for a moment he sat almost paralyzed the box fell to the seat and tottered between his legs on the edge he couldnt move he sat there watching it unable to bring his arm around the box tumbled over as the train pulled off the little boy sitting near him on the other side of the seatthe one facing him reached down and caught the box minutes before it hit the floor here your package mistuh he said he opened his eyes mechanically he stretched out his hand thanks he wiped his forehead with the back of his hand then he put both hands tightly around the box he was breathing deeply and the sweat glistened on his high black forehead he glanced at the boy then he looked to the right at a white woman she turned her eyes away he snarled and turned back to the boy did the boy realize how frightened he himself had been could this black boy when handing him the box see by the light of fear in his own eyes that fear also in his no perhaps not perhaps this was the trouble perhaps none of them could really know the others fear and thus each interpreted his own misery in his own way and perhaps too this was why the great union had never been not even in slavery itself had their travails and misfortunes been of general and similar intensity this is why john brown failed this is why the violent revolution could never be each negro interpreted his misery in his own way and measured it according to his own instruments but he would change all of this yes he and his box would set into motion that chain of reactions which would lead inevitably to a final solidification would force negroes to unite in their own common selfinterest suppose he told the boy what he had in that box what he intended to do with it he looked at the tennis shoes sliced at both ends on the boys feet he shook his head when his eyes moved to the dirty blue denim pants and the old torn faded white tee shirt the boy kept his dazed young eyes on the floor alexander carefully slid one hand away from the box and reaching into his pocket brought out a crumpled dollar bill he gave it to the boy thanks the boy said he crumpled the bill in his hands smiling for a moment his face beaming and then finally went back to searching the floor with his eyes a living dead man he whispered turning away from the boy yes a living dead man you couldnt possibly understand me no even though what im going to do is for you yes if it happens and if afterwards there is a new life it will be yours you will have to come up from the rubble and shape a world in your own image but you wouldnt understand no i could never explain it to you the train reached thirtyfourth street and the boy got off walking slowly his head down alexander watched him disappear but no one else had understood him either no none of those who had sat with him in the basement of that dingy roachinfested room in harlem one night after the first riot and these were the rebels these were the men devoted to the destruction of the system they had preceded him into the dark dimlylit basement which smelled of urine and served as the nesting place for the lean sleek furry rats which came night and day to assault men women and children three men were there roger watkins tall rangy lanky his hair bushed on his head in the an naturel style of the black nationalists alexander had met roger in a history class at city college scheid ali was also there he was a short fat man with an oval face and small sleepy brown eyes leader of a new religious sect which based its dogma on a far eastern religion his sect stressed the coming destruction of white civilization alexander did not know the third man later he found out that the mans name was james king king was of medium height and had bright skin and soft wavy hair and whereas the others even alexander himself had been shabbily dressed king was neatly almost immaculately attired he wore an ivy league threebutton suit with a conservative looking velvet collar his tie was knotted in the college fashion and the collar of his silk shirt was folded neatly around it he had a bulova watch on his arm its band the same gold color as the big ring which sparkled on his finger king was the liaison man between many civil_rights groups and sometime before he had organized a march of ministers college teachers and middle class negroes on the capital of a northern state king was speaking as alexander came in i say the riots ruined us there wasnt no sense in it the ones who did the rioting wasnt interested in no civil_rights what can you expect man asked sheid these people got a legitimate bitch against the man what they was stealing was stole before from them maybebut king started to retort roger cut him off these people got no jobs they cant make it nobody can make it without a job so they stole but its our fault because we dont do enough for the people theres enough capital here in harlem for these people to make jobs for themselves thats our problem in a nutshell we dont give the black people jobs but whyd they steal whiskey asked king hunh you tell me that what has whiskey got to do with a murdered negro boy ill tell you replied scheid the black man in america is what the man wants him to be yeah this is their trouble there aint nothing they can do until they break away from him thats malarkey replied king they got nowhere to go and they wouldnt go nowhere anyway you act like this isnt their country it aint interjected watkins ill be damned if its not shouted king waving his hands they came here before most of these damned foreigners yes sir they was here no said scheid they didnt come the man brought them wellall righthave it your way said king anyway theyre here and they are not going anywhere he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and what im saying is that they got to beat mr charlie at his own game and if they work it right they can do it at that moment the men had noticed that alexander was present he greeted them shook hands all around accepted the can of beer and pulled a folding chair from the wall he sat next to scheid across from king the answer king went on is politics we got enough negroes in harlem to damn near run the city but nobody uses this power thats whats wrong use it for what asked scheid the man puts up somebody to run and comes and asks you to vote for him there aint no difference between no two men republican or democrat about the black manbut no let me finish scheid shouted king down if they had their own state someplace of their own they could elect their own men men who would mean something to their people that aint even it watkins who had been trying to speak before finally broke in they got a state right here in harlem look outside and as far as you can see there aint nothing but black people i say they can build their own businesses set up their own programs and do something for themselves it wont do no good said scheid the white man is doomed with all the blood on his hands god cant possibly let him live naw and if black people stay with him they gonna be doomed too theyve got to break away here alexander had spoken for the first time now we have another god you talk about everything that the man has done but the worst thing is to give us a concept like god jehovah allah economics politics theyre all god man and what we have to do is to get rid of the gods i dont understand you man said king what i mean is that we have to tear down everything the whole structure we cant leave anything standing all of it is rotten youre an anarchist king accused hes sick watkins said we had this argument before yes he replied and i couldnt convince you then and i wont convince you now but as long as you let this system stand and you worship all of its gods nothing will ever happen there will never be a change no said watkins because too many negroes think like you they down on their own people im down on hypocrites and phonies and i dont give a damn if theyre black or white i know that black children are dying out there in the streets and its just as much your fault as it is the mans king stood up he stretched himself and looked at the others youre all wrong he said you dont give the people enough credit theyve got the man on the run and they can keep him there if they use their power we have no power alexander said weve got nothing but a bible some godhouses and people who dont know how much better off they would be dead he turned his eyes to the ceiling the other men were coming back at him now each shouting to be heard above the other but he no longer heard them the pain had come to deaden the left side of his face would it ever be gone no not really he knew that it would reappear again and again sneaking up on him like a thief in the dark and maybe he didnt want it to be gone maybe he wanted it to keep coming back to him as a reminder of all that was that had been and that would always be maybe he wanted it to be with him always because in this way he could always hate both that sneering sadistic white face behind the arm which had wielded the gun butt and that cynical snarling look on the black face of the man who had helped to hold him down when the pain had finally subsided he noticed that they werent talking to him any longer they were all examining the contents of a box which watkins had set on a milk crate in the center of the circle this is the mccoy he said this is it what is it he asked take a look said scheid carefully removing the cover from the box for christs sake go easy shouted king alexander bent over and looked into the box then he straightened up quickly shaking his head and bent down to take another look yes he had been right the first time there were six sticks of dynamite each carefully packed some distance from the other the spaces between each stick were filled with cotton whew he exclaimed whats the pitch they all looked at king king stood up and stretched i took it from some goddamn kids who were gonna blow up something what were they gonna blow up asked alexander i dont know but i talked them out of it king walked away to get a can of beer he came back to the little circle thatd ruin us for sure coming on top of the riots itd finish the movement what are you going to do with it alexander had asked man im lettin it go yeah we gonna call mr charlie and let him see what we got and what we done we gonna show him that some of us got some goddam sense he stood up he looked from the face of king to the others they shook their heads at him they agreed with king he bent down over the box again why we got to give it up he asked then he straightened up i mean why cant we use it no one replied they just looked at him halfdazed halfbewildered i think you crazy man said scheid after awhile no he protested im serious why in the hell dont we use it why dont we show the man just where we at that aint where we at said king and we aint ever gonna go there aint none of us here no murderers we dont agree on some things but that we agree on we aint gonna go that way its the only way he shouted somewhat surprised at the sound of his own voice there is no other way his eyes opened wider the perspiration had begun to roll down the sides of his face he waved his hands frantically in the air the pain had begun again at the base of his temples we cant go no other way he said softly youre a damn fool said king any spook who wants to do something like this is a damn fool he spun around sharply on his heels to confront king no thats not it he shouted through the pain thats not it at all you got no guts no none of you you dont want change we want change shouted king yeah and thats what well get but we dont want no destruction no we dont want to tear down the whole world he moved closer to king the other mans hot breath was on his forehead and so youll never get any change no because until everything is wiped awayall of it you wont have any change damn said king backing away i aint gonna talk to no damn crazy man but he spun around and came back pointing his finger but look how goddam silly the bastard is he appealed to scheid and watkins who had moved away from the two men he thinks six lousy sticks of dynamite can change something yeah he thinks that hell man said scheid that aint a drop in the bucket to what mr charlie got watkins stood up i aint against revolution you know that im all for it but man you got to have the people with you you need every black man in the country before you can do something like that no alexander replied clenching his fists and spitting the words through his teeth you need one black man who isnt afraid to die just one black man can make it baby yes this one man can make it he stopped suddenly and yelled the pain flashed across his forehead and for a moment it appeared as though he would fall to the floor scheid and watkins leaped to their feet king moved away from him they stood watching him he pressed his head with the palms of his hands the deep breathing wracked his body when he raised his head again his face was screwed up into tight knots there was another scream deep inside of him which he wanted to bring up but it wouldnt come just like always it stayed there nestled up inside of him he turned his eyes to the ceiling you think im crazy yeahhahai know what you thinkbut that aint it babyno i know what to doyou hear me i know what to do his body was shaking and there were tears in his eyes you think i dont know the man but i do i know he strong babybut that aint nuthinno babywe can make the man ruin himselfyeah baby they didnt try to interrupt him now they just stood looking at him half in pity half in surprise whats he on scheid asked watkins he dont take nothing man not that i know of he looks like a friggin junkie sure enough said king through the haze and blur he looked out at king you wanta know baby he said you wanta know how it is you see that box baby you take it and you go and put it somewhere yeah like maybe at yankee stadium or at carnegie hall or maybe baby you just lay it beside a bridge he threw back his head and laughed with his hands he brushed aside the invisible haze before his eyes and you let yourself get caught baby yeah you lettum know that they gottuh crazy nigger runnin around loose and you know whatyou know what he stopped again and balanced himself on the folded chair what asked scheid he laughed again mr charlie gets scared baby yeah he gets scared and pretty soon he lockin up black men like flies yeah and after that baby he start shootin black men and maybe hell build some ovens and dump us in em he laughed louder than before his whole body trembled a sob came to his throat and stayed there we make the man he rasped commit his damn genocide before the whole world we make him kill black men babynot one by one but by the hundreds yeah baby we make him wallow in our goddam blood and thats how the manll destroy himself he threw back his head and for five minutes he filled the air with the mixed sound of laughter and crying king nudged scheid get the box and lets make it man this bastards gone scheid lunged for the box but alexander had seen him moving toward it with an animallike scream which stopped the others in their tracks he pushed scheid away scheid already off balance toppled back over one of the folding chairs alexander kicked at scheid and in the same motion snatched up the box they halted in their tracks he laughed again the pain had gone now and his eyes were clear one step baby he threatened one step no one moved no one said anything im going to the bridge baby the brooklyn bridge the famous one comon with me baby there was silence they stood watching him nobody goin they stared menacingly at him all right baby he said and holding the big box tightly under his arm he rushed through the door the train reached the brooklyn bridge station he got off up on the surface he breathed in the salty air he began to walk toward the bridge in back of him the tall buildings reached up to the sky like bars running from earth to heaven and in front of him the bridge lay long and sprawling like some gigantic pathway to another world on the bridge clutching tightly to the box he walked quickly his tennis shoes making harsh ominous sounds in the stillness a vagrant walked over to him he gave the man his last dollar a negro man and a white woman walked by arm in arm he smiled at them they looked at him sheepishly and walked on far in the distance stood the statue of liberty its torch lighting up the already bright sky he turned away from the statue and walked over to the beam in the center of the bridge carefully he laid the box against the beam and pulled the long fuse out from its bottom a police car cruised slowly by he pressed himself against the beam until the car had passed he fixed the box securely and started to walk away pulling the fuse with him it wouldnt be long now no the bridge would go up in smoke right with the eyes of the lady looking on the police car had turned and was now coming back across the bridge in the lane nearest him he didnt see it he had taken out his cigarette lighter and turned once again to look at the statue there were tears in his eyes soon it would be over yes after the explosion he would go down to the police station and turn himself in he would tell them why he had done it too he already knew what he would say between me and your country there is a vendetta yes it has always been that way and it always will and i know now that there cant be any compromise no the compromise would have to be with human beings this level you have secured for yourself but i no longer want to compromise no i want to destroy you yes to tear down your world rung by rung pillar by pillar yes this is what i want he lit the fuse and watched as the flame begin to travel its length then he saw the policemen they had slid out of the car and were advancing toward him halt the voice rang out he began to run down the narrow walkway a shot tore into the wooden plank near his feet he ran faster another car had come up now directly facing him the men slid out before the car rolled to a stop the two policemen stood before him with guns poised aimed at his belly one of the men was a big brown negro the other husky and white alexander threw up his hands and screamed the first bullet tore a large hole in his stomach the second ripped away a piece of his private from behind a bullet ploughed into his skull back and front the bullets assaulted his body until at last he fell in a bloody dismembered heap to the platform he kicked his legs once in the air and shook his head then he lay still the flame still made its way to the box the other policemen had come up with mine sweepers and other devices but it was too late the fuse had burnt its way to the sticks the men began to run the police who had remained in the two cars whipped the cars around quickly and began to speed away a short distance from the bridge they stopped and turned to look back mustve been a dud said one of the policemen yeah answered another looking away sheepishly james king slid from one of the cars he had his monogrammed brief case under his arm that was one crazy spook he whispered to a negro policeman the policeman spat on the ground and walked away the derelict came back across the bridge he looked at the body lying still motionless shook his head and walked on finally the other policeman came back and covered the body with a clean white sheet heres a motion picy rip f ture popping up here l and there in art theatres around the country northern sector called

land of electronic and r mechanical marvels there ought to be a gigantic public address system over which all people could be reached at the exact same time the miracle of radio and television combined would not do the job properly because no matter how important the message theres always someone at work or asleep or with faulty equipment the massive system i have in mind would work on the order of the noisy civil defense claxon you hear it wherever you are whether you want to or not or like the pipedin muzaklike music that is so popular today the message would be loud and clear and directed specifically toward all black people in america that others would hear it is not important some nonblacks will react but most will not of course it would be tragic to prepare such an elaborate system and then broadcast a poor speech good or bad however it should ring out suddenly without warning something like this hey nigger get off your damned knees whadaya think feet were made

whaddaya mean youll listen then oh me my times up but ill be keeping an eye on you this is a recording time began the f greatest motivating force in the world has been iove love of life of adventure of fortune of fame of richesyou name it and someone has surmounted seemingly unconquerable odds to reach a cherished goal but most of the time the prince of love has been the love for a woman i will revere the black woman i will love her i would take odds with miss lincoln but the shades of ground to stand on would be almost too thin nonetheless there are some pro september issue of y rip negro digest fea i s tured a most perceptive and p rovocative article by miss abbey lincoln which asked the question who will revere the black woman i am constrained to answer that nobody will revere the black womanuntil she begins to respect herself miss lincoln made reference to the propensity of most americans to glorify all that is white and to deride the hopes the aspirations and the natural appearance of black americans this attitude is found exceptions to her monologue on the neglected disrespected black woman accepting the essence of her plight i will still contend that the black woman stands much taller than miss lincoln sees her the plight of the black woman is a manifestation of the plight of the black man this primeval use of the black woman grows out of the degradation of the black man as was stated in the opening of the article who will revere the black woman the comedown you cant do that or you are a negro comes too often to the ambitious young negro and he or she must con vince himself or herself that anything can be done despite the odds let me again say i will revere the black woman in all her splendor draped in the finest costume that man can produce or money can buy touched with the hand of god like makeup to enhance her beauty or disguise her ugliness i will revere her i will revere her in dirty rags and natural comeliness with a smile on my face i will tell her that she is a splended creature and is much to be admired moreover i will give her complete respect and advance in the face of danger to protect her i will proclaim her virtue and defend her innocence in deeds i will promote the sentiment among men that black is beautiful and gentle honest and faithful i will glorify each instance of greatness and crown the head of the victorious but most of all i will praise and promote her heritage with all my mind strength and courage i will seek to obtain the best place in society for her seat give her every comfort that life can afford that she may be able to take her rightful place among the highest when it is done i will proclaim to all the world that god has made no mistake in creating the black woman and man that the world is richer and more beautiful because of this black orchid this laden rose of sharon is set high in the grandeur of humanity yes abbey i will go to the out houses and call black women to come into the pavilion to join the horde of women who are passing through to a new life with new hope i will dispel the notion that black women are jealous and evil moreover i will gather about me men who will do the same and we will bind up the bruised head comfort the broken heart and bid our fellow men to resort to violence no more i will join the poets in writing and saying lovely enchanting words to the black woman and about her i will protect her right to choose or refuse romance to insist upon nobler terms than the outhouses or the subjected homes of misuse and abuse i will spread my coat for the black woman to walk upon keep a strong arm for her to hold on to build her a castle for shelter from nature kindle a fire to keep her warm give her children to love most of all i will give her the respect and devotion that will make her queen of her house in this she will be confident and proud beyond her door cast now your eyes upon the field of the black harvest see what the black man and black woman have wrought all the world stands aghast despite the scorn there is respect despite the criticism there is praise despite the wanton lust to exploit there is deep reverence for no man has ever beheld anything more glorious than the versatility of the magnificent black woman in all her shades hues lines and contours proportioned yet i alone cannot redeem the black woman the image of the black man lies buried beneath the pall of hopeless dreams this abandonment of logic and aggressiveness has become too much a motive for apathy the baby must be magnified black the boy must know that his place is anywhere under the sun or beneath the shades of night and there with him is and belongs the black woman she must be there and remain there until her honesty courage beauty virtue hopes and aspirations are known and realized i am to the fore and always will be yes i will revere the black woman let her cry to me her rape her aching head her abandonment her shameful use by charlie come to me my black princess and i will be your knight the september issue of y rip negro digest fea i s tured a most perceptive and p rovocative article by miss abbey lincoln which asked the question who will revere the black woman i am constrained to answer that nobody will revere the black womanuntil she begins to respect herself miss lincoln made reference to the propensity of most americans to glorify all that is white and to deride the hopes the aspirations and the natural appearance of black americans this attitude is of course a part of the legacy othe institution of human slavery as it was practiced and experienced on the north american continent the slave was a chattel an item of commerce a thing stripped of rights denied humanity he was bred and used as a beast with little or no reference to the precepts of morality or human dignity the north american christian attempted to justify such treatment of other children of god by simply denying the common humanity of blacks and whites blacks were to be treated as animals because blacks were animals placed on earth for the use and convenience of the real humans the whites our blackness was to be a sign of inferiority a sign of shame it followed then that the closer one came to shedding ones heritage of negritude the closer one came to being human to be slavishly imitative of everything white was to be on the path to quasihuman status it is tragic that this conviction of black inferiority not only was but is the dominant american racial feeling not just of whites but among blacks as well and this returns us to the question of respect for negro women the bitter fact is that perhaps a majority of black women would resent even being called black too often the black woman seeks acceptance and emotional security by imitating all of the downright vulgar traits of the most insipid and superficial of white american females what makes so many black women believe that cheap and glossy little cindy lou is the epitome of femininity miss lincoln makes mention of the compulsive frying of black womens hair by other black womentheir refusal to accept the fact that black women are most beautiful when they proudly acknowledge their negritude and quit trying to be what they will never succeed in being and ought not to want to be anyway miss lincoln wrote of skinbleaching sessions and other means of self and groupdegradation one would have more reason to evere black womanhood if more black women could surmount their selfhatred long enough to realize that quite a few of us black men are not at all repelled by broad facial features or broad behinds or countenances which are black and shiny for when the black woman reveres so highly the straightening comb she betrays to blacks and whites male and female alike her own lack of selfesteem and her lack of esteem for black males as well it is difficult to conjure up much respect for such a forlorn creature who does not even respect herself and it is irrelevant that so many white american girls are also vulgar and shallow whites can be our persecutors but we can only be betrayed on this issue of our own standards by other blacks it is galling and senseless that partially emancipated slaves persist intheir eager selfenslavement to all of the frivolities which their former masters can dream up it seems that this is just another sad instance of our glad acceptance of the least attractive items that white america has to offer it is certainly depressingly instructive to reflect on the sizeable amount of rent and food money which is being spent the wigs for the black ghettos some may object that i am unduly critical of black women for accepting the myth of white superiorityblack inferiority which a large majority of americans black and white including most negro males also believe in and suffer from but our women are the repositories and the exemplars of our standards of beauty and so long as our standards of beauty reject all that is natural about ourselves and accept the most artificial of white values we will not rate in our own estimation that equality which we demand of our society those of us who earnestly desire a just a stable and a peaceful resolution of the present menacing third chapter in the unfolding american dilemma are aware that the new society which we must build cannot be based upon superficial good feeling overlaying outmoded concepts of group or selfhate and the first step in attaining the status which our humanity deserves is our own acceptance of ourselves not as black imitation whiteys but as our own black selves unashamed of our birthright of dusk and shadow for who will revere any of us if we do not even respect ourselves
two paraphrase mark t twain everyone talks about the black revolution but no one does anything about it the movement seems to be unable to recover from the martyrdom of malcolm and unable to learn from and be guided by his life his death was a terrible blow but martyrs are often more effective dead than alive malcolm achieved immortality during his last year when he rejected racism and embraced orthodox islam a universalist religion by escaping from the trap of reversing the symbols he freed us to create new symbols many of his followers cannot understand the profound significance of malcolms religious conversion experiences and try to reduce him to a vulgar political figure both black nationalists and white liberals each for their own reasons ignore malcolm the universalist humanitarian because the black revolutionist has not learned enough from the life of malcolm he tends to become a cultist offering ritualistic compensation for blackness andor a poseur playing the role of spokesman of the black masses for the benefit of those white folks who dont know any better the masses is a great abstraction for the black revolutionist if he comes from a bourgeois family he does not know them and has been taught to despise them if he comes from the ghetto he escapes from the masses into revolutionary politics usually a cathartic talkmarathon signifying nothing the ghetto is hard to take cold sober everyone finds an escape religion for old ladies alchohol for the mature drugs for the young the children are the only realists the black masses as an abstraction is an invaluable defense mechanism for the black revolutionist to relate to the people of the ghetto to look unblinkingly at their faults their virtues their suffering their potential to give love and compassionthe only thing that can win their confidencerequires saintliness k william kgositsiles article is the black revolutionist a phony negro digest july is the first breath of fresh air on a scene that has become an exercise in futility it is honest it asks the questions which must be asked it is oriented towards psychic autonomy as a constructive substitute for the sterile game of reacting to whitey when he says we are inherently more interested in humanity than in the material values of the white western world he has pronounced a liberating phrase a philosophy that can transform the black masses and detach them from things as symbols of power and loveobjects which are a cold compensation for helplessness and lovelessness there is a certain dignity in avowed slavery avowed slaves work because they are captured or kidnapped or sold or born into slavery they are chained and beaten thats why they work for their oppressors even the wage slaves that marx wrote about in the th century had some dignity they worked or they starved thats a good reason to work but the modern western worker works because the system stole his mind he strives for things which represent worthiness and the less worthy he feels the more desperately he strives this craving for objects as symbols of power and love poisons relations between husband and wife between parents and children he ends up loving no one and nothing but his car i think polishing ones car has become a widespread form of sexual perversion a psychologist should think up a name for it the modern western worker may work harder than a slave and never think his own thoughts but he believes he is free and to me that is the very depths of degradation for all the extraordinary qualities of the ghettoized their perceptiveness their basic grasp of reality their ingenuity inventiveness adaptability ability to endure and survive stress to an almost incredible extent their latent spirituality and transcendence they still largely accept the image which the white world has of them the children still insult each other by calling each other black and nigger or saying your mother is blackin spite of all the newly independent nations of africa and because the black masses are at the bottom of the pecking order the ghetto becomes a caricature of empty materialist values e franklin frazier called the black bourgeoisie exaggerated americans its not just the bourgeoisie the ghettoized hardly believe in their own existence and cling to objects and roles in dread of nothingness the black criminal clings to his evil if you tell him hes not evil he panics malcolm came up from degradation that is normal it is the degraded of the ghetto who have the greatest potential they are the least socialized the unwilling slaves to society never the willing slaves rewards mean little because they never expect to get any punishments they learn to live with they must either become saints or die and everyone knows that the ghettoized are experts at survival if the black masses are hung up in the material values of the white western world the black revolutionary intellectuals are hung up in the social thought of this same white western world any theory is an attempt to make some sense out of reality but theory like logic is not truth it is a tool which when properly used helps man to understand and cope with reality when the theory masters the man it screens out the reality that conflicts with the theory during the th century when western man became enamoured with science he convinced himself on the basis of faith that there were laws which determined the development of society that man was profoundly rational and that one had only to discover these laws and point out to ones fellows where their selfinterest lies to solve the problems of the world social thinkers in the west marxist and nonmarxist alike are still caught up in this delusion their response to their failure is more and more frantic intellectualization which only serves to further aggravate their alienation from reality and to insulate themselves from their intuitions the result is intellectual escapism compounded by a feeling of helplessness in the face of inexorable social forces freudianism while correcting the view of man as essentially rational added a new ingredient of panic the unconscious was evil and destructive holding terrible secrets which we dared not face i believe contemporary western social thought is an intellectualization of martin luthers vision of man as absolutely depraved and lacking in free will the enthronement of rationality stems from distrust of emotion the concept of man and society as being determined by inexorable laws stems from denial of free will the externalization of social change processes reduced man to the role of a cipher but if we allow ourselves to perceive the reality of social change we find that the revolution is not so much out there as it is in herein the mind and soul of man because man tends to become what he believes he is spirituality is a powerful highly contagious emotion and in my view mankinds most profound emotion a revolution in the psyche of one man can become an allpowerful force for social change st malcolm was such a man the historical evidence is impressive and i hope the reader will bear with me while i make a detailed summary of the findings of the distinguished anthropologist anthony f c wallace wallace studies revitalization movements which are attempts to abruptly innovate whole cultural systems shifting relationships into a new pattern they are reactions to extreme stress induced by an unsatisfactory society and an attempt to reorganize society in order to reduce stress he made a comparative study of several hundred religious movements both western and nonwestem on five continents and abstracted common features of these movements for radical change those involved in such movements perceive the culture or major areas of it as a system feel that it is unsatisfactory innovate not merely discrete items but a new cultural system specifying new relationships and in some cases new traits wallace projects the concept of the mazeway or the image of nature society culture personality and body as seen by one person the mazeway is related to concepts of self worldview and behavioral environment wallace does not explain the mazeway too well but i think he means it is the socially determined manner of perceiving and evaluating which screens out sensory and evaluative data which conflict with what one expects to perceive within the framework of what one has been taught to perceive wallace says that when stress is unrelieved the person is under great pressure to change the mazeway while wallace does not explain the cause of the unrelieved pressure i would speculate that such stress arises from a sharp and growing conflict between the image of the world as perceived through the mazeway and the world as it exists in reality or applying the concept to the united states at the present time unrelieved stress results from the conflict between the intuitive knowledge of the world which is strongest in the young and their sociallyconditioned conscious perceptions and evaluations changing the mazeway involves changing the total gestalt of the image of self society culture nature body and ways of action it also may be necessary to change the real system by this think he means the social structure to bring the new mazeway and reality into congruence the effort to work a change in mazeway and real system together so as to permit more effective stress reduction is the effort at revitalization and the collaboration of a number of persons in such an effort is called a revitalization movement all religions have their origin in revitalization movements societies go through five overlapping stages in what he calls the processual structure the steady state in which people are reasonably satisfied with the culture except for a few individuals for example psychotics period of individual stress in which growing numbers of people are subject to increasing stress and begin to consider alternatives period of cultural distortion which is a prolonged period of stress and anxiety provoking the following responses a rigid response the person tolerates high stress rather than admit innovation b flexible response new techniques more or less in conflict with the mazeway are adopted in personal life c regressive response uncontrolled dissipation introgroup violence passivity dependency indolence psychosomatic disorders depression and selfreproach corruption in public office the culture becomes internally distorted stress continues to rise resulting in disillusionment with the mazeway this period could lead to the death of the society or to the fourth stage revitalization or mazeway reformulation the movement promoting revitalization can be religious or secular but it always begins with an abrupt and dramatic moment of insight a realization of relationships and opportunities in the mind of one person such an event can be described as inspiration or revelation in religious movements the prophet or messiah receives one or more visions the content of his message is universal obey the moral rules and practice the rituals or personal and social catastrophy will result in secular movements or religious movements in which the innovator does not see visions the process is a moment of insight but in all cases it is sudden and dramatic a radical inner change in personality takes place soon after the vision experience the one receiving the insight or revelation feels a sense of mission or messianic obligation the visions have been called personality transformation dreams they occur in a waking state or in an ecstatic trance and impress the dreamer immediately as being meaningful and important their manifest content is largely rational a wellconsidered intellectual argument and a cogent moral exhortation the personality goes through a radical change in a positive therapeutic sense prophets believe they have communicated with the supernatural but unlike psychodcs they do not lose their sense of personal identity but psychotics tend to become the object of their spiritual longing once the mazeway reformulation has been completed the movement enters into a second stage which wallace calls communication the prophet attracts disciples and converts who believe they are coming under the care and protection of a supernatural being and that both the convert and society will benefit from identification with the new culture system the next stage is organization during which the movement takes shape sometimes there is a division of labor between the prophet and a disciple who is the organizer or political leader the converts to the movement undergo a revitalizing personality change the next stage is adaptation as the movement becomes stronger resistance is provoked and it evolves strategy for coping with resistance some strategies are doctrinal modifications to make it more acceptable political and diplomatic maneuvers and force the next stage is cultural transformation in which the entire or controlling portions of the population accept the new religion re vitalization occurs reduction of personality deterioration symptoms extensive cultural changes enthusiastic embarkation upon organized programs of group action these programs can be more or less realistic the next stage is routinization in which the new mazeway finds general acceptance the movement shrinks to a purely religious function eg the preservation of doctrine and the performance of ritual finally a new steady state emerges which is viable and different in content from the old steady state wallace says there are two major variables determining the success or failure of the movement the realism of its doctrine and the amount of force exerted by its opponents if the organization cannot predict successfully the consequences of its own moves and of its opponents moves in a power struggle its demise is very likely in order to survive the movement must be canny about conflict and the amount of resistance must be low the conventionality of the doctrine does not appear to be an important variable the doctrine can be extremely unconventional as long as the leaders are realistic i have burdened the reader with a detailed summary of the wallace article because i find his view of secular revolutionary movements as being essentially religious more convincing than the view that religious movements are essentially secular in short i have more faith in faith than in rationality but more important i believe that wallaces concept of the revitalization movement is extremely relevant to the black revolution and to the role of malcolm in it it seems clear to me that malcolm is the revitalizing messianic figure capable of saving a society on the brink of destruction if his followers can recognize who he is and emulate him any movement which leaves the old mazeway intact is necessarily shallow and manipulative slogans such as we want what youve got implies that what youve got is of value a revolutionary movement must be realistic i am afraid that revolutionary theoreticians trapped by enlightenment social thought emphasizing the struggle out there and seldom realizing that there is a struggle in here sometimes go to absurd lengths trying to apply hoary abstract theories to problems which they obscure rather than solve one example is the definition of the strategic goal of a revolution as seizure of state power there is some real basis for such a concept in the deep south especially in the rural black belt area such an attempt in large urban centers in the north is not cool at all but it is perfectly realistic to be the real power in the ghetto and outside the ghetto in relationship to racist murderers or potential racist murderers all that is needed is the confidence of the masses effective black institutions render white institutions irrelevant and because many theoreticians consider economics the most essential question they tilt at windmills trying to find a fundamental economic solution which does not exist one can demand jobs ad infinitum and get no more than token results if not reversals because the structure of the economy is precipitously reducing the demand for unskilled labor some say that the answer is socialism but a substantial number of whites would have to go along with such a solution then what happens to the autonomy of the black revolution unless one projects the seizure of power and the carrying through of a socialist transformation by blacks on their own that does not strike me as very realistic either another variant of the search for a fundamental economic solution is the ideal of a separate autonomous black economy the latter solution i believe is as unrealistic as the former if the black revolution can become the real power in the ghetto many of the abuses especially the parasitic ones can be corrected while this is not a fundamental economic solution it would help along with the usual demands for economic reform perhaps the black masses may never have what whiteys got but why not encourage people to become themselves instead of aspiring after the rotten materialist values of the west when m kgositsile makes the impassioned cry where is our program of action he articulates the feelings of many people possibly one explanation for the paralysis is the impact of western social thought which is in an advanced state of decay lets hope that we can surprise ourselves not out of the window but into the ghetto to relate to the real flesh and blood people who live there i feel it incumbent i g upon me as a young t black deeply committed g a s ffer menting black liberation movement to respond to some of the conclusions and implications suggested in dr price m cobbs analysis of the american identity crisis as it manifests itself in urban insurrections and violence by black people in general journeys to black identity negro digest july without doubt dr cobbs analysis is a brilliant and refreshing explanation of the psychopathology that plagues black and white america he states in no uncertain terms basic underlying motivating factors which scientifically explain the violence blacks now perpetrate in the streets of american cities indeed i think his article may be regarded as a major psychosociological essay concerning violence and identity as it is related to the black liberation movement and for this dr cobbs is to be given full credit and a sincere extension of gratitude from all of us who are constantly attempting to come to a greater understanding of problems we are facing however i cannot help but take issue with some of the concluding inferences suggested by his article when dr cobbs states that black men in america can only go part of the way alone in the establishment of his manhood and that the attainment of an effective and mature manhood by black men can in the final analysis only be permanently achieved through cooperation with others i am forced to denounce this kind of reasoning as logically as well as psychologically inconsistent with a true understanding of what is real in the white psychological milieu the recognition that many whites in america suffer from the same identity problem as do blacks thereby linking them in a common bond so far as the identity problem is concerned is indeed a correct and valid observation and i take no issue with dr cobbs on that point what i do take issue with dr cobbs on is his inference that this might serve as a uniting bond between the dehumanized blacks and the dehumanized whites and together these two dehumanized identitydenied groups may effectively strike out against the thingscentered culture that has dehumanized both of them i choose to label the situation that black and white people in america have been subject to as one of dehumanization of which the identitydenial problem is but one aspect of this more inclusive program once again i am forced into a position of complete agreement with dr cobbs insight regarding the violent potentialities of other nonblack identitydenied factions of the society indeed the history of white racist lynching validates this point beyond repudiation however i think the dynamics of identitydenied violence and its possible manifestations by nonblack members of this society need further explanation with whom are manhoodidentity seeking blacks to unite for the effective establishment of their manhood and identity since according to dr cobbs they cannot travel the entire length of this road alone are they to seek and expect help from those persons who in attempting to dehumanize them have been dehumanized also whence is the coalition to spring besides is a coalescence between the dehumanized dregs of white racist america and an anxious angry and aware also armed black america desirable or even feasible these questions are obviously rhetorical any clearthinking man whether he be black or white can easily recognize the absurdity of dr cobbs position if black manhood and black identity are to be truly authentic and significant it can only be meaningful and lasting if it is fully and completely the fruits of an allblack effort the same applies to the white identity and dehumanization problem if it is too to be effective and meaningful it must be achieved wholly by white efforts granted that the problem that confronts both groups is the offspring of the same parents decadent christianity and misguided capitalismbut the children have grown and matured in two entirely different settings any attempted merger of the two at this ripe old age could only result in compounded chaos and confusion let us examine for a moment the most possible manifestation in which the identitydenied violence of white america might declare itself as noted earlier this type of violence already has a rich history of manifestation in lynchings castrations and rapes to assume that they will in the future be directed toward someone other than black people is i think unjustifiable moral and historical naivete what is more likely to take place is that the more blacks move to recapture their humanity and establish iden tities whites will attempt to block this with every means at their disposal for we must remember that the valuesymbols of identity and masculinity that white americans have managed to delude themselves into thinking are meaningful have been maintained and realized at the expense of black people and the harder blacks try to establish a meaningful black identity the more they undermine the foundation on which socalled white masculinity and identity rest for the only common identity conscious or unconscious that most white people share is that of white superiority the only way most white men in america experience some feeling of masculinity is by identification with james bond or tarzantype pictures or by some outright oppressive acts of violence against blacks to be sure whites have an identity this common identity that they have is based on their unconscious collective acts of oppression against blacks and is no more real than the images they have forced on blacks and the unreality of it becomes increasingly more apparent as blacks move towards liberation through affirmative acts of violence the more blacks seek to acquire their identity through affirmative acts of violence the more white america will respond with totalitarian and oppressive acts indeed what is at stake is the whole system of white superiority values on which rest their identity symbols the fact that both whites and blacks have an identity problem only heightens the possibility of armed confrontation between the two groups it does not mitigate the possibilities nor can it serve as a uniting force as dr cobbs article subtly suggests indeed the present psychological symbols for masculinity in america conflict directly with what i understand to be the aims of the black liberation movement frustrated white identityseekers will most assuredly seek to identify with these symbols blacks are moving to destroy and replace the present white symbols of manhood and to a certain extent already have been successful the more successful they are the more desperate white identityseekers will become til finally they will attempt to resort to their most base and blatant display of manhood castration or murder of black men and savage rape of black women this i maintain is more likely to be the manifestation of white americanidentity seeking for in actuality white america is not really seeking an authentic identity historical truth would cause them to go insane but rather it is attempting to preserve and perpetuate the existing identity valuesymbols one closing note relative to the concern of dr cobbs that the american identity may remain white while the democratic system is destroyed the main problem of the socalled democratic system in this country is that it has always defined and manifested itself to black people as wholly and completely white american in identity indeed the two are inextricable the coalition between white and black identity seekers is a historical psychological and moral impossibility the achievement of black identity and authentic moral manliness can only be achieved by black people alone the denial of this by dr cobbs is scientific inconsistency or academic infantilism i cannot help but detect in these outlandish purportments by dr cobbs that same old slave cowardice and feeling of helplessness and estrangement whenever the slavemaster is not permitted to run things in the last few years the trend in womens hairdos has turned towards the natural look popularized by miriam makeba odetta and joanna lasane pictured above in the laymans circles only the hippest women are supposedly brave enough to wear it in a black nationalist sense it can be viewed as a symbol of feminine freedom from white standards increasing numbers of women have begun to wear naturals and this would seem to indicate that more black women are interested in exhibiting some racial pride however even though this may be true we should not overlook the fact that frequently the visible signs of protest and radical movements become meaningless and mutilated over a period of time because people who want to be hip and inpick up the symbol for whatever social gains are attached to it they are in many cases to tally unaware of the aesthetic idea which produced it one wonders if it is fair to count them as converts to the new religion i choose to call black who if anybody should wear her hair natural what does it mean when a woman cuts her hair wears it short and kinky in a world where negroes are trying a different brand of race pride everyday certainly there has been enough printed matter on what it means to be a negro in america but reading such material is obviously not the weapon we need to handle the situations we know of unless it can teach us to understand and then manipulate the audacious situations which daily confront us the most conspicious way a black woman can protest the prevailing beauty system is to cut off her hair when i was a child the old folks used to say man is gods glory woman is mans glory and hair is womans glory and the interpretation of this has been the more hair the better the straighter the better and the longer the better but those who can only read their names can point out that the book does not specify long or short glory straight or nappy glory and so on nevertheless black women have for years waged losing battles with hot combs grease sweat rain water of all kinds and origins to adhere to the standards set down by the system when the howl for integration began and finally died down to echoes of assimilation the wig and permanent had their most elaborate debut here was a way by which one could transcend the humiliating reminder that one was not white forego all the heated discomfort of maintaining ones glory the result was instant whiteness only the skin remained to point out the enlightened and the ignorant and once again we rocked our chairs too far backwards and our piecequilted values slipped off our laps yet we rocked content that at last we had patched up the ugly and they laughed and made money off our mixmatched blackness we do not know nor can we imagine who the first modern afroamerican woman was to shove the system into the melting pot and wear her hair mostly the way it was we can be certain however that when she did this a new kind of homosapien was revealed to her she met whites and black bourgeoisies who were furious and disgusted by her lack of judgement and tasteher nerve for extolling the ugly she met brothers and sisters who laughed and turned their heads because she was a mirror and their reflections were too bright too clear people stared on buses and leaned out of cars and muttered go back to africa and nappyheaded devil black women apologized that they had nothing against it for those few who could wear it but that they couldnt because their faces werent the proper shape their hair not the kinking texture excuses were given when none were asked excuses came when none were needed and the real issue was obvious we have been lumped together into huge bags made of lies that the power structure invented and now the bags were full of holes and decaying and we were stupidly fumbling around trying to stay in them the lies black is evil and ugly thick lips and kinky hair are unsightly and so forth and forever if we let it be we were spooned the lies and we digested them and when we first saw and tasted black beauty which is a part of black truth we were experiencing a food we have been starving for throughout years of mental embalment for the natural look is only one crumb of a giantsized loaf of bread black pride is the main dish it can be served in the form of studying our beautiful black history wearing african clothes thinning shoe leather in marches and countless other ways the real issue is not the hair its only importance lies in its relationship to the whole black pride is the menu and it can never be served too often for we can spice it up or water it down like hash and potatoeswhenever it is set before us we will always be able to recognize it if it is who should wear the natural look and what does it mean all those who want to be in that way black beautiful and trueand these are no small things for in truth there is strength and therein lies freedom it is worthwhile for me to mention and important for those who question the unfamiliar faces of black truth to know that someone with perhaps a tanned but not so black face will remind them when they forget that essentially there is no difference between the blacks who wax in afroamerican style and the negroes who wallow in archaic white standards the fire that mr baldwin speaks of will be allconsuming allencompassing and when charlie turns the hoses on and attempts to put it out those emulating him will not be protected by any plastic invisible shield we will all get wet and we had best arm ourselves with steel shields of blackness coated with red rubies of truthnatural in their origin absolute in aim campbell is s an actor at detroits concepteast theater a bushyhaired barrel or a black man who likes to strut on stage and trumpet a poem he composed entitled let freedom ring kaping kaping he mocks a rifle at its conclusion then after a pause comes the cruel irony damn fool dont you know thats freedoms ring campbells verse devastating in its directness describes a state of mind that is mushrooming in his town detroit where night snipers came to symbolize avenging assassins and in the explosion of their rage completed the birth of a breed of black man who is unafraid as a result in the days of endless dialogue and search that have followed the detroit riot the mantle of leadership has been resting more and more on the shoulders of what had been virtually an underground movement the motley group of people who call themselves black nationalists for several years detroit had been considered the center of black nationalism overshadowing even new york but the ferment of its fiery activists had drawn little public note now it is inescapable heading the citywide citizens action committee ccac formed in the riots wake for instance is rev albert cleage wouldbe politician veteran organizer a man whose angry fires scorch black people are tired of hearing i had a dream america is a nightmare the rev mr cleage calls his church central united church of christ the black nationalist church and the ccac which nominated officers at a rally attended by several hundred citizens some community leaders and organization heads now is known as the new black establishment this new establishment proposes to negotiate with and give orders to the new detroit committee composed mainly of leading white businessmen which is charged with planning the citys rebuilding ccac includes according to militant attorney milton henry some moderates some not so moderate a few who are a little radical and others who are just plain out of sight this surge of community involvement by selfstyled militants while not unexpectednationalists have built noisy if shortlived confrontations around every crisis from a poverty program cutback to a high school student boycott occurring in the past five years nevertheless has deep implications now for detroit where the nations most destructive riot has triggered an identity crisis of mass proportions middleclass negro leadership which had boasted of its ability to freely enter the smokefilled rooms of the white power structure now is in a frantic race to reclaim its connection to the negro whose plight was its only real excuse for being meanwhile this socalled negro mass seething with unlocked tensions seems likely out of the torment to spawn its own leadership the fact that leadership from the outside cannot be superimposed on this mass no matter how desirable this leadership may seem to outsiders was well demonstrated during the riot young do rag nationalists and others jeered and flung rocks at young and supposedly popular u s rep john conyers jr nearly toppling his halo in the process but as conyers himself later admitted only someone with the violent connotations of a malcolm_x could have spoken with authority to the rioters for the destruction in detroit went beyond the point of selfhating negroes lashing out at their own environment a feeling which still can be channeled through promises of improvement the naked thing that conyers confronted was the release of pentup rage by some fairly middleclass as well as lowerclass negroes and even poor whites that had been so long suppressed it was uncontrollable when it burst free a civil_rights program supposedly is not built on rage but in reason yet for black nationalists particularly black internationalist revolutionaries who consider themselves part of the worldwide struggle by black people to end their oppression anger is the prime mobilizer and this is the detroit dilemma the struggle now for the still largely uncommitted mass is being waged between the established negro leadership and the more militant forces so far aided by a greater facility for the gut talk of the people since they often are the people the militants are winning this battle their cries for action unity and change effectively capitalizing on the mood that lingers with the cinders in the citys ravaged communities it is a mood that unmistakably calls for many meaningful responses to the explicitly expressed discontent some nationalists and the term often is elastic enough to include even an outspoken speaker had begun to seize control of the riot when it was forming in the streets some do rag brothers who are considered incipient nationalists encouraged looting and arson while a few internationalists are believed to have aided the mystery snipers a riot is not a revolution explains glanton dowdell cochairman of the rev mr cleages ccac and a man who says he believes in black nationalism but sometimes at its height people geared to it find it necessary to intervene so people dont become mutilated a disciplined revolutionary will not participate in or encourage a riot unless there is no other alternative in detroit maybe there wasnt author louis lomax who journeyed here in the midst of the destruction felt nationalist involve ment in the riot had been crucial charging in a frontpage series in the detroit news that door to door salesmen peddling black_power had set the stage for the rebellion several weeks before its fires erupted and it is a fact that the celebrated blindpig whose raiding triggered the violence had also been a meeting place for minors under the tag the united community league for civic action nevertheless most local observers now agree that the riot was largely spontaneous but nationalists understandably are not surrendering without a struggle the rich philosophic gains that are theirs to be snatched from the holocaust in the riots midstream richard henry brother of milton and a technical writer issued a list of ultimatums to the city in the name of the malcolm_x society including amnesty for rioters which he claimed would quell the disturbance predictably the ultimatums were largely ignored but a key weapon remains in the hands of nationaliststhe drive for unity unity for the time being is a goal of the entire negro community unity in demanding changes unity in resisting any resulting increase in the forces of bigotry unity in defining the real needs of negroes and interpreting them to the white community and this goal of community unity closely resembles the black nationalist goal regardless of geographic boundaries language differences etc one told me we are one part of a black nation first and above all else detroit nationalists also are remarkably unified themselves separatists who want countrystates for negroes work with nationalists like rev cleage who believe negroes must control their own communities and the do rag nationalists who quote malcolm_x but imitate whites by processing their hair this new call for unity which now finds many people thinking temporarily or permanently like nationalists can be unsettling to both negroes and whites a white employee of a downtown office cornered a negro coworker proud of his white collar and equally white diction the other day and whispered worriedly say eddie what about this h rap brown why ask me i dont know as much about him as you do was the offended eddies swift reply eddie of course was lying h rap brown drew an audience of persons many milling in the streets when he spoke here recently at the dexter theater and eddie was one of them the shift to the open airing of nationalist sentiment is even more evident in the pages of the formerly conservative negro weekly the michigan chronicle shortly after n the riot rev cleage was given a column in the chronicle and one of his first pieces was entitled unite or perish avowed nationalist henry slayton also has begun writing for the chronicle one article headlining black_power can build as well as destroy the fact is the nationalists kind of talk is beginning to make sense to many negroes particularly youths who are turning inward for solutions to their problems including the new fear of genocide through vietnam which is gaining currency in the community the only people the white community respects are those who speak up nadine brown communitylabor figure and newspaper columnist who openly identifies herself as a nationalist told a ccac rally and some of the people present had heard many other speakers received many promises in this town where labor unions taught negroes the meaning of militancy and organization and the auto industry built hopes in a growing middle class that society never quite fulfilled malcolm_x had whipped some into a frenzy of bitterness but spurred no action and then came stokely carmichael with his black_power in a year when congress reversed itself the dream of integration died during martin_luther_kings march in chicago africa its customs and hair styles became palatable and the momentum of the rights movement screeched to a halt now there is something on the scene called black nationalism and it is a search a state of mind a hardening conviction that whatever went before was inadequate the detroit challenge is how the middleclass negro is to keep the place that he has won while others find theirs theres lots of negro prosperity here but too many guys arent getting a piece of the action the chronicles managing editor a dunmore told a new york times reporter yet dunmores words are tame alongside those of slick campbell kaping kaping he fires at his audiences who always sit silently awaiting the inevitable fury damn fool dont you know thats freedoms ring recently a peoples tribunal was con vened by the citywide citizens action committee ccac at central united church of christ at the last moment the tribunal had to be moved from the dexter theatre because of pressure from the white power structure the executive board of central church came together immediately in a special session and unanimously granted the ccac permission to use its building the vote was taken after dan aldridge and lonnie peek cochairmen of the tribunal working under the legal department of ccac advised of the threats pressure and harassment which had been used to intimidate law yers witnesses and members of the committee central church officers stated quite simply we love our church and the building in which we worship but even if granting permission for the peoples tribunal to be held here means the destruction of our building as churches have been destroyed in birmingham and all over the south we still have no choice we serve the black messiah jesus of nazareth who came to unite and free an oppressed black nation our brothers have been brutally slain and it is only right that the voice of truth silent in the corrupt halls of justice should ring out in the house of god so the peoples tribunal was held under the soulful eyes of the beautiful black madonna the foot painting by detroit artist and ccac cochairman glanton dowdell which dominates the sanctuary of central church and still another miracle of the many miracles which have been performed by the black madonna since her unveiling last easter sunday came to pass fear was driven from the hearts and minds of black brothers and sisters the first miracle had occurred the day after the unveiling when glanton dowdell and general baker arrested in connection with last summers kercheval rebellion had received suspended sentences not only the officers of central church were touched by this strange fearlessness the witnesses despite warnings not to testify and innumerable other efforts at pressure and intimidation appeared and testified is it not peculiar that their testimony which the prosecutor had considered not worthy of use in the regular court was considered too dangerous for use before a black peoples tribunal for every lawyer who found an excuse not to appear two more volunteered members of the committee worked around the clock investigating and sifting evidence one member was forced to remove his telephone to stop threatening calls to his wife until the tribunal was actually under way the committee could not be sure that an injunction or some legal maneuver would not be used to block the hearing as had been done in to prevent the playing of a tape of officer speichers testimony in the cynthia scott murder on the very night of that meeting everybody involved had been served with an injunction the brothers and sisters dont know what fear is any more in spite of the last minute change of location they began to arrive at central church at pm to be sure of a seat by pm the sanctuary and fellowship hall were filled to capacity and people were still coming from everywhere more than people were in the building and others were outside trying to get in it was a beautiful tribute to those black young men whose lives were taken in senseless acts of police criminality there is no way to put down on paper the sheer horror of the recital of events by witness after witness it is hard to believe that such bestiality could exist in the world that a group of ordinary white men could so hate ordinary black men yet it is so we should have known it before from the days of slavery from the days of reconstruction from everything that has happened to us in this land of the free and home of the brave but always we have tried to forget to close our eyes to reality to pretend we should have known when systematic genocide was introduced in mississippi to kill innocent black men women and children who dared to demand constitutional rights reserved only for white men women and children we should have known when black boys were systematically drafted out of all proportion to our percentage in the population to die in vietnam we should have known it in a thousand ways and deep down within each of us we have known but we have been afraid to face the truth but fear is gone horror remains but fear is gone indecision may still exist there may be different ideas about what should be done but fear is gone as the witnesses testified the packed auditorium became more quiet than a courtroom each individual relived the horrible moments faced by three unknown black boys victims of nothing more profound than the hatred of white men who hated them because they were black as i listened and looked out at the crowd i could not help thinking of the paintings by jon lockard that hang in the lobby of the church i thought of the painting of the black messiah the strong black face under a crown of thorns suffering beaten humiliated but undefeated and when a mother cried at the witness story of the death of her son the indignities he faced the senseless cruelty of his dying i could see the picture of mary at the crucifixion i wonder if the crowd as it filed in orderly quiet through the church lobby and into the street saw in the tears on her black face the tears of black mothers in every generation who have seen the cruelty of oppression and its effects upon their sons and daughters but fear is gone mary may cry at the crucifixion but she is not afraid black men may be crucified but they are not afraid and in some strange new way we are forging a unity of the spirit which binds us together in love and in dedication to freedom thousands of people came together in testimony to this fearlessness and to this dedication we are living in a new day detroit is a new city and black people have a new spirit during this writers high school and college days in detroitin the forties and early fiftiesthe power structure through its spokesman the local daily press fastened onto one negro leader as the epitome of respectability and acceptability for the black community that man headed the local branch of a national service organization whenever there were signs of revolt out there on the west side or on the north end or especially down around paradise valley and environs the editorials rolled forth to admonish the blacks that they had it good and that they would do well to aspire to emulation of that esteemed leader who had found large sympathy in the white community and to prove how well considered their man was the power structure elected him for the umpteenth time to some position on some commission where he was the first negro he was wellrewarded for his services to the cause of the status quo this muchadmired negro leader was the most colorconscious man i have ever met black or white as a feature writer for the michigan chronicle in the fifties i once went to talk to him about the prospect of utilizing a section of his headquarters for meetings of a writers and theater group an idea whichto his credit appealed to him since he had some years earlier sponsored a similar group during the half hour or so of my interview this man amiably discussed people we knewor knew ofmutually invariably making some comment or description which referred to the individuals color people were light brown or very light or dark brown or deep tan or dark or quite dark or black or very black and it was very clear that people occupied niches in some hierarchical structure in his mind and affections according to the amount of melanin in their skins i never had occasion personally to go to the agency this man headed to seek help in the areas in which it functioned but i had friends who did some of them luckless people later complained that preference always seemed to go to the sons and daughters of socialites and that those favors which the agency was in a position to grant did not necessarily go to the most qualified candidate it was an old story needing no substantiation it is the way life is but not the way life has to be during those years in detroit society was the thing scarcely an edition of ebony magazine hit the streets without some gorgeous photographic coverage of a grand ball a grander debut or an even grander weekend at a country estate or private island if black people were denied jobs and refused service in downtown sandwich shops gerrymandered into substandard schools or routinely beaten up by the police these things were regrettablebut bearable after all there were edward turner and art johnson of the naacp to handle such matters and turner and johnson did what they could routinely over on detroits west side and up in pontiac some miles away a trio of young men were making noises against routine racial discrimination and the routine response to it the detroiter was albert b cleage jr pastor of a presbyterian church the other two were suburbanites milton henry an attorney and his kid brother richard they were troublemakers young cleage had a hassle with the bigwigs of his church and ended up by dressing them down the henry brothers kept the temperature hot around pontiac disturbing the peace in every area from housing to police methods and their enemies made appropriate trouble for them eventually members of the cleage family joined with members of the henry family and launched a newspaper designed to express the general dissatisfaction of detroitarea black people they also tried other publications all failed which is another sad commentary on black people not on the cleages and troublemakers stuck to ven in the dry years before the black revolution sparked down in north carolina and burned gradually northward they stuck to their guns and their targets were as often the apathetic socialites spreading the ghetto out through oakman boulevard and seven mile road the new gold coast the power structure labeled the troublemakers racists and the socialites naturally echoed the charge however something new had been added to the old scene the black revolution had liberated a lot of negroes turned them black and made it acceptable at last for black people to say what they always had thought they said it and to everyones surprise thousands of black folks out there in the ghetto responded by the time a brash young rebel named stokely carmichael exploded upon the scene black people had been aroused to their possibilities as never before and they no longer needed to pay homage to the socialites and to the leaders the power structure had selected for them in detroit the cleages and the henrys were joined by a string of talented and forwardlooking people with the new vision among them artist henri king artist glanton dowdell bookseller edward vaughn attorney andrew perdue james boyce alvin harrison william flowers and nadine brown an organization called forum came into being sponsored two successive black arts conventions see page and sparked a renaissance of blackoriented thought and activity spreading its influence across the nation the malcolm_x society a semisecret organization sprang into existence during the summer of the malcolmites made a list of demands on the inevitable commission named by the city administra tion to study the causes of the detroit rebellion the demands included governmental cooperation with community institutions in rebuilding and relocating houses and businesses the election by districts of city councilmen school board members and police commissioners neighborhood participation and veto rights in urban renewal projects a policy of compensatory employment of black people and compensation for all black people illegally arrested and inconvenienced during the rebellion a detailed plan for the redevelopment of the th street area center of devastation during the rebellion was drawn up by the malcolmite society rendered by artist henri king and presented to the newly formed community council and land cooperative the point welltaken and strongly emphasized that black people are going to decide how their communities are to be built and operated the comprehensive plan proposed the construction of a complex of low medium and highrise apartment buildings a series of recreational centers a small industries park compact shopping centers new schools and libraries a professional and business plaza a community theater a community art center parks playgrounds and a complex of single and multiple dwellings in the wake of the rebellion cleage and his cohorts joined with other concerned detroiters to form the citywide citizens action committee ccac an organization which through unifying the black community could serve as a lever in negotiations with the new detroit committee a similarly new organization representing the traditional power blocks within the greater community for all intents and purposes the black people who are directing the new organizations represent the new black establishment in detroit few of the old leaders are heard from the daily newspapers no longer seek to impose on the restive black community the leaders they have chosen and a new sense of pride and yes of power is clearly visible in the faces and in the voices of the ordinary black people the new black leaders have aroused a new kind of hope in detroit something happened to detroit it happened suddenly though not without prior warning it hapned with thorough tactical prossionalismthough apparently ithout leadership it happened by visible people whom even negroes generally did not know or recognize this something happened to the city and the whole city while all of the citizensnegro and white were baffled and unbelieving spectators upon their own paralysis before it is over it will have cost the citizens possibly lives and over million dollars in looted vandalized and burned business establishmentsand in burned and gutted homes and apartments an even greater cost will be the sudden sacrifice of the justified and still justifiablereputation of this city as being the only city among all the major cities of the whole nation which has taken as many creative initiatives in human and community relations and which has built as many strong bonds of interracial and interfaith coalitions it is the one major city which escaped such violence for a quarter of a century it still is farthest along in the establishment of a genuinely viable democratic community where almost everybody has a meaningful role in the total enterprise of community life that is everybody except the totally alienated what happened had no clearly enunciated rationale and none has yet come forth from any participant or spokesman it had no identifiable leadership yet it happened suddenly swiftly sweepingly apparently without need of these although the phrase race riot was used by communications media for lack of better terminology it was clear even to the news media that this was neither a race riot nor a racial demonstration in any previous sense of that phrase or by any parallel with any events of the past decade yet it also could not be characterized as a rebellion or an insurrection by reference to any present experience this is because too few are acquainted with negro historyand particularly with the early revolts of both slave negroes and white identured servants it takes this special knowledge of american history to see the precedents in connection with previous demonstrations and riots we are accustomed to seeing the buildup of overt hostilities and to witnessing eloquent appeals of spokesmen being denied or ignored before the main event there was none of this prelude moreover the acts of vandalism then burning and then sniping generated neither ethnic political civil_rights moral nor social rationale to sustain them yet they were sustained one most baffling fact is that no apparent and certainly no sustained hostilities were aimed at either groups or persons other than those specifically charged with authority to restore order or to quell fires there was no person against person fights no gangs chasing either negro or white persons no racial encountersand no general diminution of interracial communication and social intercourse at any level in the community if anything one became suddenly conscious of a heightened degree of interracial cooperation throughout the community this costly tragicomedy defies even symbolic association with the racial epithets of the black_power clique it is strictly a negative power demonstration by the alien within our midst that alien has racial symbolism but no race we are yet to clearly understand this the phrase black_power which cropped up early and disappeared of its own inappropriateness really had no emotional force in an atmosphere of interracial looting interracial vandalism interracial incindiarism and interracial sniping except for the location of the initial incidents the event cannot even be described geographically as a ghetto phenomenon so quickly did it travel from the ghetto to the avenue of fashions and the boulevards of luxury establishments even that move was highly selective in targets the important thing is that within the initial target area and before the spreading flames took their own toll as a result of firemen being hampered the targets were exclusively business establishmentsand those were selected as though on a predetermined schema moreover the thoroughness of the selection and the completeness of the destruction of so many business establishments in so widely scattered parts of the city in so short a time had all of the earmarks of professionalism well rehearsed timing and even tactical preplanning yet supposedly no professional leaders were evident in any overt identification in fact no leaders or leadership types were evident equally important there were no acts of violence directed agains any private persons or racial groups as such during the entire course of events there were none of the chasings beatings gang attacks or killings of private persons such as characterized the detroit race riot of or the many subsequent demonstrations and riots elsewhere throughout the nation that we have witnessed since in no sense was there persontoperson hostility on the contrary there were constant and paradoxical observations of a peculiar sort of quasihumorous circus atmosphere like the annual student riots at fort lauderdale floridabut different in addition there was the specific absence of any gang patterns even among the snipersprobably the most astounding and foreboding fact is that better than per cent of the entire population of this metropolis was caught completely unaware of such a possibility even as it was occurring the few prior scattered weekend events with definite racial overtones on three or four successive weekends were handled by due process of law and were accepted by the community on the merit of that process but those events did not involve the completely alienated when this event struck upon us with all of its costly and devastating fury its participants were not recognizable to any of the more than human relations civic religious protest and even extreme protest groups which have been vocal and active on social issues in detroit nor did they enlist the support or participation of any of these groups or organizations in any cause that they represented as the looting and vandalism progressed for in truth they did not represent a cause they represented a fact what then is this fact this fact is that the elusive they have many highly developed skills which the national society even in the best city in the nation will pay a dearer price for not using or for turning into expert destroyers rather than training them and using them constructively we must not fail to see the symbolism in the simple fact that a blind pig raid provided the generating spark so long as we continue to force a choice upon those who are alienated which tells them that they can in factfind a more lucrative life and more peergroup acceptance by engagement in illegal than in legal activity so long as the school dropout cannot find acceptance among any respected and legitimate employers and so long as he knows that even if he does that employer will not be able to compete in wages and personal fringe benefits with the illegal business enterprise then so long will it be a basic pragmatic and attractive choicethe same kind of choice made by the other per cent of americans to adopt willie suttons law and go where the money is but once gone and once in the pattern of seeking success through that route his powers must then be developed refined and utilized by such as will hire and use them for illegal activity so we had better start our route to repair by clearly distinguishing in our own mind between the notpoorbyincome poor criminal and illegal operators from the real poor for it is evident that their chief victim is the poor we also must separate in our own minds those who are clearly bent upon the destruction of our society from legitimate civil_rights activists for it is evident that the formers goals are completely incompatible with the existence of a community in which civil_rights has any meaning in this connection we had better begin to be much more discriminating and sensiblein the national interestabout who is characterized as a negro leader a destroyer is not a leader except to destruction it is imperative that negro or whitewe distinguish between negro leaders and both negro and white destroyers we also must not be too quick to label a product which we have massproduced in our own communitys educational social and economic system a criminal as though that ends the problem that is where the problem begins we produced them their values ar our values their wants are our wants but our good life is not their good life and our belonging is not their belonging since they do not have open and constructive routes to the achievement of these our avenues are not their avenues to the enjoyment of the things we take for granted and they demand either to have these things or to see us pay a terrible toll for their being so denied this is their plain economic pragmatism moreover the wider the gap between the affluent and the alienated the narrower the perimeters for choice either way become and by the fact the more closely does any community approach the prospect of recurring violence this we can never afford and survive so now we have a different kind of confrontation than has appeared before in recent history for this was a revolt a revolt differs from demonstrations as we know them from riots as we know them and even from insurrections for all of these latter are overt in both leadership and design revolts are covert devastating and sudden not since the gabriel prosser and nat turner revolts of the nineteenth century have we seen this phenomena several commentators made the mistaken comment that this was the biggest riot in american his tory they were far from righton two scores this was not a riot and it is not the most costly even in detroit history in human lives the faulkner riot perpetrated by white persons in march cost more lives and proportionately more property finally we have become so accustomed to our social concerns about those who are segregated from the mainstream of society that we just have not developed the social instruments and programs to really enfold those who are alienated from the total society now even in this most progressive city of detroitthey have got around to us and when they got to us we had no readymade racial answers because they are both negro and white we had no economic palliatives because they are not among the organized and visible poor we had no moral response because the morality of nonviolence has not brought to them the rewards it brought to us we had no community response because when we have seen them they were in but not of the community moreover it must give a peculiar satisfaction to a person who has been denied induction into the military service to see himself pinning down soldiers for minutes with sniper fire in his own private warand then escape never forget no matter how strong we are in our bonds of community and no matter how con cemed we are for the continued health and growth of our city the alienated are not the same as the segregated the segregated are part of the society itself nothing in the recent history of demonstrations and even riots is comparable to the revolts of the alienated so such attempts at analogues will be futile we must go all the way back then and study the dynamics of early revolts to learn what the present events in detroit and elsewhere have been about and when we study them we should find that the rebellious slaves and indentured servants shared these three things in commona concealed but deep resentment in their consciousness of complete alienation an unswerving desire for the better things they saw around them and a devastating capability for sudden destructive and seemingly unorganized revolts against authority for those who have continually demeaned these people and argued that the community and the nation should not make the extra effort to reach them should not make the extra investment in their more realistic education training and selfimage building should not make a larger investment in their adjustment to the constructive and legitimate job market should not be concerned about the investment in and reorientation of services for their health family and environmental improvement should not expand upon the programmed efforts at finding with them a place of belonging and respect and personal dignity in our community and in our society whatever this cost in lives property community pride and fear of swift destruction from sources unknown is only part of the price that we must continue to pay for not doing so with the recent superimposition of the theory of violence upon the formerly nonviolent moral thesis of the civil_rights movement even detroit has not been good enough or strong enough to be spared if it can happen in detroit it will happen anywhere else in this nation however if we bring to bear upon this community after this shock the same constructive and creative resolutions which have carried us through years before we shall find a way to open up alternatives to them that will both spare us and embrace them and that better voice of detroit will be heard again in our land the new chairman of sncc h rap brown daniel watts editor of liberator mrs betty shabazz charles p howard and the reverend albert l cleage were speakers at the opening session of the second black arts convention sponsored by edward vaughns forum in detroit june and july and that was prior to the detroit rebellion sessions were held in rev cleages central united church we didnt make the laws why should we obey them brown asked change your color and then your power will change mrs shabazz the widow of brother malcolm spoke briefly on unity citing the unity of the jews in the suez crisis the reverend cleage said meetings like this would always be welcome in his church howard said we can change the system only through black_power he defined the black mans enemies as big business big labor the church and some civil_rights lead ers watts said that the white mans freedom is the freedom to exploit when we cry freedom with our warmth the white man doesnt understand us there is no dialogue he said blacks did not need a separate state that there are laws providing for local areas to part from governing bodies and form their own governments june was devoted to a youth conference and july was given over to panels and workshops in the panel on religion islam and the yoruba religions but not the christian religion were represented when moderator milton henry asked what could be abstracted from the different values henry wells said neither islam nor christianity are effective he urged the conferences to forget individualism and to accept collectivism drew ali bey and b i bey advised the panel to work together on what is good in a religion not to concentrate on its faults the yoruba spokesman said the arabians were notorious slave traders and advised using the native yoruba religion as a base and traditional beliefs as a guide to government in the panel on literature rhobena nelson stressed the need of selfknowledge and selfidentity francis ward associate editor of ebony said the responsibilities of the black writer were to devote himself to the struggle for equality and freedom to give leadership through his writing to discover and promulgate black history and to interpret the condition of the peopie the black writer may have to be both writer and activist ward said adding that since he knows his own life best he may start from there then later write on larger areas the black writer doesnt have to leave such questions as love hate and war to white writers ward said he suggested that there is a fine line between art and propaganda leroi jones writes on black problems but has literary skills and is a genuine artist bobb hamilton poet artist and eastcoast editor of soulbook went further into wards ideas he said that literature communicates emotions and analyzes and criticizes events it can destroy and that is not bad and should be done hamilton said he added literature is inseparable from the life of the people black literature was destroyed although negroes are trained in engineering and economics these have no cohesion literature is as important as religion it forms a people dudley randall poet and publisher said that the themes of writers conferences had been first the role of the black writer then the black audience and the trend of opinions was that the writer should write as a black man and to and for the black audience we are a nation of twenty million and could support a flourishing literature he proposed a national book council sponsoring a national book week and an organization to promote the creation and distribution of literature and to disseminate information about literature later a group of writers and editors met and listed what each wanted and what each could provide amer rashid and ahmad malik shabazz who said he was the first black man to enter rice university read their poems shabazz said a new breed of poet was coming out who went deeper than surfaces and caused the reader to go deeper they used the art of leroi jones images symbols rhythms without rimes line endings and split lines to suggest their meanings instead of direct presentation in the panel on racism in education arthur reese said that americas schools were racist from the beginning many teachers have provincial parochialism and criticize a students grammar and ignore his meaning reese said the teachers not the students are culturally deprived as they cant communicate with their students he suggested teachers say black history should be integrated but how can you integrate truth with myths reese asked how can you teach that thomas jefferson was a hero when he was a slavemaster the solution is not to put black teachers in black classrooms for many of them are white with black skins the solution is to force schools to teach as they should david llorens assistant editor of ebony said the quality of education must be improved american schools are for training not for educating james baldwin richard wright and malcolm_x taught me more sociology than anyone ive ever come in contact with it is essential that black people control schools in their neighborhoods llorens stated a teacher who understands stravinsky but not james brown shouldnt be teaching black children he said the american educational system teaches you that the white man is humane and therefore you cant believe america supports haiti south africa and similar regimes a mother mrs helen kelley related a problem she had with a sudden change in her daughters program causing her to spend fifty dollars more for books she said parents have to stay in the schools and demand their rights in the panel on art charles enochs statement that art must communicate and serve the purpose of the movement was challenged by henri king who said he didnt go along with the idea of being used he was against social editorializing and artists making themselves hacks painting black christs and malcolm_xs this was only imitating king insisted the role of the black artist is to create something new and dynamic to destroy everything in art today and replace it with something new he has created king said he also warned that using african art is commercial as it wasnt created for fine art harold neal disagreed saying that artists must stop being a specialist and must be like any other black man fighting for his freedom he didnt go along with tired white boys who introduce a series of dots one year and are hailed by critics who have to find something new king said that black artists have not created their own art form that black musicians have enoch agreed that black people have no soul art that can be looked at and called soul art neal said that no black painters have responded to the murder of medgar evers or to the bombing of the four girls in birmingham on july the delegates voted that each should send a letter to howard university protesting the firing of dr nathan hare and other professors and the expulsion of activist students and that forum should send a telegram of protest to the university and one to dr hare supporting his efforts edward vaughn asked all organizations to forget differences of ideology and to form a national liberation front within the black arts confederation of unity dudley randall presented mrs betty shabazz with a copy of the memorial volume of poems for malcolm_x titled for malcolm which was signed by all the poets in the book in attendance at the convention joyce whitsitt and le graham included in the book read poems on july there was a parade and the convention concluded with a speech by dr vincent harding of spelman college on the gift of blackness he said that black people have a beautiful heritage some may want to put down part of it but the whole heritage has beauty and can help us to obtain our freedom he said he praised the beauty and the poetry of the spirituals the afroamerican can change things and he must not forego the spiritual aspect dr harding warned the national foundation on the arts and the humanities under pressure has added four negro magazines to the list of more than which are consulted for material for the american literary anthology annuals the four magazines are phylon freedomways black dialog and soulbook for those readers who are not familiar with the whole flap involving the national foundations american literary anthology and negro magazines here is a brief rundown the national foundation in granted for the publishing of an anthology of literature compiled from the little magazines published in this country by little magazines the foundation had in mind those independent and universitybased publications dedicated to bringing out the literary works of writers of talent who have not yet received recognition by the literary establishment there are as the number cited above illustrates quite a lot of these magazines some of them appear for only an issue or two and then fold and so there are always new ones on the scene what the foundation proposed to do in its annual american literary anthology was to select from these magazines the best of the poems stories criticism sketches and essays publish this work and then generously reward the authors and editors each poet whose work was selected would receive a gargantuan sum when it is recognized that most of the little magazines can afford to pay nothing at all authors of stories and essays would receive the editors who originally selected the work also would be rewarded handsomely to preside over this project the foundation chose george plimpton a rich society dilettante who has written several books a committee of established writers all white was named to judge the material these writers were robert creeley and john ashberry for poetry walker percy and william styron both southerners for fiction and robert brustein john thompson and benjamin de mott for criticism a year ago negro digest contributor william barrow wrote to carolyn kizer director of literary programs for the national foundation on the arts and the humanities informing her that as the project was conceived negro writers would be excluded from participation in it mr barrow explained that the racial realities being what they are few negro writers ever are published in the little magazines he proposed that the people involved with the anthology therefore had the responsibility of seeking those publications which welcomed the work of negro writers he named negro digest among other magazines miss kizers reply to mr barrow was lofty in the extreme she implied that the magazines listed did not qualify as little and did not emphasize literary content and furthermore that it would be counter to the law to give special consideration to negro writers the thrust of her argument was that if negro writers were not represented in the conventional little magazines then tough barrows argument and received pretty much the same response from washington there was not even a suggestion that the foundation might relent and consider negro magazines even though negro digest submitted a list which included liberator soulbook black dialog and freedomways however negro digest had decided not to allow the foundation people to ignore black people so cavalierly pressure was mounted articles appeared in negro digest and finally when no satisfaction from the foundation was forthcoming letters were dispatched to the offices of all the negro congressmen that brought a response toward the end of august a letter arrived from the foundation signed with the name of roger l stevens the top man stating that freedomways black dialog soulbook and phylon had been added to the list of more than magazines from which material is culled for the anthologies the liberator and negro digest were not included because it was felt that the material which they contain is not primarily literary any more than the work of magazines such as the nation and the new republic well negro digest still feels that black writers are getting shafted in this deal but the fight is in the open some concessions have been made and others can now take up arms if they feel it important enough the first anthology will be published by farrar straus and giroux in the spring and has been set aside this year for the second anthology to be published a year later throughout all this flap with the foundation an important fact has emerged it is simply that the black establishment writersthe writers acceptable to whites but usually considered irrelevant to the negro cause are being used as consultants by the white people at the foundation that being the case it is to be expected that those black writers will be favored who embrace the artforartssake approach to writing incidentally saunders redding former professor of literature at hampton institute and author of several books including a new novel is the top negro at the foundation he is director of the division of research and publication in the august issue of redbook magazine jean wheeler smith spoke to the hundreds of thousands of middleclass white women who read that publication eloquently stating how and why she learned to feel black it is a beautifully simple and straightforward piece of writing mrs smith negro digest readers will know is the lovely detroitborn girl who left her studies at howard university and went off to the southern wars with that valiant band of young sncc workers in that seems in the early fall of a lifetime ago well she labored faithfully finally returned to howard for her degree married frank smith a fellowsncc worker and settled in mississippi to carry on the fight and to try to make a life all this is told in the redbook article but it is background to the core of jean wheeler smiths message in i learned to feel black the young lady traces her personal development ernest j gaines can write rings around dozens of american novelists with far more glittering reputations a quiet serious young man with no apparent passion for selfpromotion he has not forced himself upon the public stage where so many contemporary writers are busy gilding their eminence in when his first novel catherine carmier was published not even his publishers atheneum seemed inclined to provide him with that necessary public relations push which would have brought the novel a share of the attention it deserved for catherine carmier without question was one of the finest novels of that season in a notice of the book in negro digest the reviewer termed mr gaines a writer with artistry in his touch he has the gift of perception and an affinity for that truth which is larger than the lives he creates in several stories published subsequently in literary magazines and later collected in anthologies mr gaines artistic touch has remained sure the stories like catherine carmier have been concerned with the lives of ordinary people black and white and inbetween in the rural louisiana of the authors own beginnings the inbetween is important in this context for the complex legacy of several interrelated traditions and institutionsslavery the french language and culture and creole societyremains strong and viable in the land of the bayous and yet author gaines is concerned with these traditions and institutions only insofar as they establish a frame of reference for his themes stated gen erally these themes revolve around the conflict of eras the new world of mobility and expanded possibilities impinges on the old world of landlove and solid accepted social stratification the old realities of the plantation culture gradually surrender to the demands of industrial pace and technology the oncerigid poles which separated ruling whites from cajun and cajun from mulatto and mulatto from black have been bent all out of shape mr gaines describes human beings caught up unwittingly and often unwillinglyin a quiet and inexorable revolution and there are subordinate themes in the sky is gray one of the authors first pubished stories a painfully poor black mother by a single act of simple pride teaches her young son and demonstrates to whites who would patronize her the great dignity inherent in the human soul in a long day in november another of mr gaines long lyrical short stories full of the nutty flavor of rural southern life a sixvearold mt boy watches his tormented father savage his honorand his marriage in a day of gentle but terribe crisis in catherine carmier a cofieeveducated young man returns from california to the ancient greataunt who adores him knowing that he must shatter her hopes by informing her that he never again can share with her the old values and customs of his childhood in his new novel of hove and dust published under the banner of a different house dial mr gaines combines all these themes weaving them into a subtle literary tapestry which no amount of sensational writing or sociologizing can equal of love and dust set in tells the story of a brash young louisianans headlong journey to doom marcus a handsome irrepressible rogue has murdered a rival in a knife fight in a baton rouge tavern andon the plea of the noble old woman who reared himhas been placed in the custody of marshall hebert owner of a vast plantation a still viable remnant of southern feudalism hebert represents power he is a law unto himself and at his word marcus can be either sentenced to prison or set free pending his trial marcus is put to work in the fields with sidney bonbon a harddriving cajun as his overseer bonbons task is to break the spirit of the arrogant marcus a job he undertakes with accustomed relish but the citybred marcus is not so easily subdued though brutalized by the tedious work he remains unbowed not only that but he succeeds in scandalizing the black people on the plantation by his uninhibited womanizing fully knowing the danger he nevertheless courts pauline the beautiful black woman who is the overseers lover failing at that he stakes out an even more dangerous prey he decides to seduce his overseers childlike wife louise one of those pale creatures left loveless in the big house while her man is off tumbling in the sack with black servant women marcus daring leads inevitably to disaster this simple outline of the story cannot convey the texture or the depth of the humanity with which if is told all the characters are vibrantly alive they have been clearly and truly seen and all the intricate relationships and undercurrents which characterize the pattern of existence in rural louisana are traced with skill and certainty aspects of the story are classic the white master with his black concubine and the mulatto children he cannot legally claim the myriad black servants and retainers profoundly wise in their subservience a greek chorus in blackface the murderous secrets which propel the corrupt overlords toward still more murder and degeneracy and yet none of this familiar material is treated with banality marcus story is told by jim kelly in his own language the simple unadorned language of an intelligent if uneducated black man of honor jim is a tractor driver on the plantation an unbonded worker and the man who would be marcus friend like all the other black people on the plantation jim at first finds marcus overbearing and despicable a man totally lacking in humility and humanity but later as fate catches up with marcus jim makes a telling discovery he finds that it is his own fear of breaking the old taboos of claiming his own manhood which made him fear and hate marcus he begins to see marcus less as a villain than as an emergent hero he begins to understand that marcus violent and dangerous behavior grew out of marcus refusal to submit to rules of living which violated his manhood marcus jim learns at last was a man of honor and integrity in the fashion he had adopted for himself because he could not accept the pattern that had been imposed upon him when jim first learns of marcus fantastic plan to escape from the plantation with louise whom he has awakened to life jim feels that marcus has gone mad but gradually realizing that marcus could have gone off alone to safety rather than risk everything by taking the woman along jim sees that marcus has begun the climb upward from the armor of inhumanity with which his bitterness had clothed him marcus act of love has reclaimed him in the end jim leaves the plantation knowing himself a better man because of marcus it is not possible given the elements of the story that of love and dust will find the popular audience it deserves because the novel deals honestly and from a black viewpoint with the commonplace but nonetheless delicate sexual relationships prevalent in the bayou country it will bemust beeither downgraded or dismissed by the critics whywriting in a recent issue of negro digest ottilie markholt explained the critics can acexcept long suffering oppressed negroes who may be pitied she said but they cannot accept strong free black people who know they are morally superior to whites but neglect of this novel will be a crime against literature the critics keep crying for good novels and they keep ignoring them when they appearif the novels do not say what the critics want to hear in the way the critics want it saidhoyt john oliver killens sippi trident press has been heralded as his most ambitious novel after reading all pages of this novel i decided that mr killens first line in this classically bad novel should have been once upon a time there was a fair white golden haired maiden who lived in the big house on the hill and a handsome black boy who lived in a shack down in the valley on the girls fathers plantation everyone knows the story by heart naturally the goldenhaired one and the little black boy are going to meet in the woods the bedroom the tree the cave or wherever and fondle each other innocent sex play but in mixed hue this is the beginning of what proves to be a series of deadly plodding events that all lead nowhere the black boy goes to college in the south white girl goes to school in the north and falls into an integrated group of bland clicheplagued middleclass negroes who talk as though theyve been expertly programmed to blare their class times and color black boy and white girl make it in new york black boy has been making it all along with an older woman in college town a kind of growing up white in black skin or something meanwhile down in sippi civil_rights is the thing white folks find out that black folks have changed black folks find out black folks have changed little black boy goes back to mississippi to find himself and become a part of movement some people are killed and black boy realizes that hes colored too and joins the elders all the characters move through sippi in two dimensional sleepwalkers stupor saying things that are expected of them in light of the plot and message they just dont come to life these shadowy people are used as good propaganda foils now there is nothing wrong with this kind of polemic it just is not a novel i find it impossible to say anymore about this novel do not object to the theme the people the locale i find that it is not art we know nothing more about the people the situation and the past or present than could be casually picked up from reading the new york times perhaps the fault is that there are too many writers who have not learned that there is nothing so deadly as the stereotypical southern racial conflict southern sexual dilemmas and southern myths which give us nothing more than southern racial conflicts southern sexual dilemmas and southern myths whether white or black these writers had better move beyond the history books and the present psychological lore and tell us something about our dreams nightmares and partial consciousness and in so doing engage our total being in this experience as painful or joyous as it may be to do less is not a sin it just is not artronald williams saunders redding has written a book called the negro potomac books in which he says among other similar things the following negro writersincluding poets playwrights and novelistsconsider themselves spokesmen for their people in the s and s the best of them were speaking more clearly and were listened to more attentively than ever before richard wright was one of the first of these but wright moved permanently to france in and lost touch with the living reality of america italics the reviewers the passage might have been written by any number of removed white critics referring to the new negro selfimage mr redding credits the american press and indeed all the media of mass communication with reacting to this image responsibly italics the reviewers apparently mr redding is familiar with an american press and a mass communication media which manages to elude most of the rest of us but that kind of statement is rather general throughout this little book less than pages of text which could not have been conceived for the consumption of black people in any case this is not a harsh judgment writing of the widely publicized fracas at the united nations following the murder in the congo of patrice lumumba mr redding says the following blaming all the worlds troubles on american imperialism and the white mans inborn perfidy and pretending to see this nations connivance in the murder of patrice lumumba the first premier of independent congo a rabble of these extremists staged a riot in the un that interrupted ambassador adlai stevensons first speech to the general assembly italics the reviewers it sort of speaks volumes for itself volumes mr redding never intended to peak mr redding by the way is a government man currently

tolson died jean toomer died in april and the next month marked the death of langston hughes all three of these poets were writing during the negro renaissance of the nineteen twenties jean toomers cane published in was one of the best and earliest of the books of the negro renaissance it had a great influence on emerging writers causing them to write unabashed and unashamed of the negro as they found him even today in the recently published anger and beyond toomer is referred to again and again showing that he is still influencing todays writers tolsons first book rendezvous with america was not published until in it he showed great erudition a concern with history and a mastery of varied poetic forms his libretto for the republic of liberia and harlem gallery showed a mastery of the complex and sometimes obscure poetic idiom of the modern academic school although admired he has not had many imitators or followers langston hughes was one of the earliest and most prolific of the renaissance poets he continued writing almost until his death pouring forth a stream of poems novels plays biographical historical and humorous works many negro writers have been influenced by his humor his choice of racial themes his artlessappearing free verse or his variations or syncopations on traditional forms like the ballad stanza or the couplet all of these men will be remembered most of their poetic contemporaries including claude mckay and countee cullen are dead or are silent in poetry like arna bontemps or almost silent like sterling brown who will take their place one looks to the next generation of poets those of the forties robert hayden and gwendolyn brooks are the most meticulous craftsmen margaret danner has recently published poem counterpoem margaret walker pours forth her verse in a fluent mass but she seldom publishes frank marshall davis and owen dodson have long been silent m carl holman and gloria oden seldom publish one also looks at the newest generation of poets its outstanding member is the fiery leroi jones originally writing in the obscure greenwich village idiom his recent identification with the black masses has caused him to write with more clarity and force there seems to be another renaissance of black poetry taking place today but the loss of these three giants has left a great void who will fill it support your los cal police the g bumper sticker read vs and i should have known better from the way he slowed in front of me before he got to the toll gate and from his hesitation and his annoyed ahhh the hell with it gesture that he gave me crouched over from the cold but i should have known not to relax as i ran up behind the car after it stopped my eyes on that bumper sticker support your local police but then the harrisburg exit of the pennsylvania turnpike seemed a gateway to the below freezing winds and i had been trying to get any kind of lift for all of two hours thanks i said when i got into the car where you cornin from new york been waitin long about two hours its a lousy spot where you goin the driver asked san francisco boy you really got a trip ahead of you havent you yeah i guess i have well im only going a few exits down and then im going south thats how i ended up in lexington virginia route goes right through there and thats where my driver was going to lexington the radio says theres a snowstorm cornin from the midwest yeah thats what i heard this morning after that it didnt take much prodding from him to get me to take the swing below the mason dixon and out of the path of winter i entered the south almost without looking back i told him that i was going to san francisco to get married and find a good job he seemed to believe that my fiancees name was patsy mae and that she worked in a laundry pressing shirts and that i usually found work as a janitor or in a car wash thats the story i usually use when hitchhiking all over the country to everyone marriage and janitor or car wash ive learned that that story works on nearly all of them for hours i can spin out fantasy about my patsy mae and how good life is going to be for us especially if i get work in a good firm out west like dow or lockheed or boeing and how california is famous with us colored people all across the country for them wonderful lifetime jobs i tell these stories with a straight face and sometimes talk so much about patsy mae that the more brainy of my benefactors become bored with my conversation but i know better than to tell them that i am a writer especially a playwright and that im going to the west coast this particular occasion to see one of my own plays in los angeles and to see and make love to an old girlfriend of mine in san francisco people get upset when you tell them the truth some might even be hurt especially those who have strange stickers on the bumpers of their cars now what if i would have said im a playwright involved in the black revolution and im hitchhiking to california to see one of my black revolutionary plays or im going to see my exgirl friend shes white you know winking as i say it and i dont honestly know truthfully whether im going to see my play out here cause ive seen it already or to see her smiling at my own candor shes very nice and white being jewish and raised in st louis but actually born in texas so more than likely you have much in common with her now i couldnt say that could i those answers shouldnt come from black hitchhikers writers or no and since i knew this i changed my speech accordingly yeah patsy mae and me

patsy mae and thats how it was across a lot of the country next time i might fly except that theres a lot of stories to hear and see between here and there jason jerked his hand it back into the cell in another second it would have been crushed by the heavy steel door licking his burned finstared incredulously through the bars at the obese guard why did you do that he demanded what you know put that cigar out on my hand oh that drawled the guard i just wanted you to move it sos i could shut the door jason was so angry he could hardly see he could focus only on the guards huge neck bulging from a grey collar on which was stamped mississippi state penitentiary he longed to grab the red splotched neck to squeeze it until the network of blue veins stood out like railroad tracks but he was out of reach he banged his good hand against the bars but realizing the futility of his anger he turned away from the guard to face the other fellows who had been packed into the tiny cell with him a few filled the space around the toilet the others stood cramped between the two steel bunks in the dim light he squinted his eyes searching for chenault he would know what to do chenault was lowering himself onto a bottom bunk his face brown and lightly freckled was rigidly set jason had known him for five years since they had been seniors together in college they had worked together and slept in the same room but he had never seen chenault so tense maybe jason thought chenaults worried about the others who were arrested with us during the demonstration smart of those cops to pick us out as the organizers and bring us up here to the state farm left all the other demonstrators in the big compound nobody left to work with them hope theyll be alright willie c a tall thin boy in overalls broke the silence chenault ben say the guard told him he was gonna take all us clothes away say he be back to get them after he finish his dinner what must we do i dont feel right without my pants on i dont want to give up my clothes the others crowded together on the bunks and began to argue over what to do jason spoke up over the noise of course i want to hear what chenault has to say first but i think we ought to go along with what the guard tells us we dont know how long well be in here before the office can get up the bond money but its gonna take a long time to raise you saw what just happened to my hand obviously these guards can do anything to us they want and nobodyll know about it til its too late lets give them the clothes willie c whined chenault what you think we must do im scared shut up willie ben shouted you sound foolish chenault aint no more than anybody else in here just cause he talk bout concepts and such dont mean he know better than me or you what to do bout these crackers stop begging him to tell you what to do and think for yourself ben sprang to the floor and strode the twostep limit to the wall of the cramped cell he was a short paunchy black man whose age was somewhere between inserting his thumbs in the bib of his blue overalls he said now i think what jason said was wrong he just got to mississippi a month ago aint been in jail a time in his life before now and he gonna tell us how to act i know these crackers and if we start giving in now theyll keep pushing us harder and harder to see how much crap they can make us eat taking our clothes just the first thing they gonna do to break us down and show that they the boss man here jason looked to see chenaults reaction to the problem of the clothes he sat quietly staring impassively at the huge door why doesnt chenault say something certainly he knows tluit this first decision is critical we have to stick together have to react in a unified way it was chenaults practice to encourage everyone to speak to draw out the opinions of the less vocal and then to come up with a plan which reflected the feelings of everyone this plan was usually accepted immediately and with a sigh of relief but now he didnt seem to be listening jason willed him to pay attention come on man get on the ball this is important we got to face that guard chenault remained quiet lifting his head to listen only when ben spoke jason knew that chenault gave special weight to bens opinions since they usually reflected the opinions of the other local mississippi people who worked with the movement and everyone in the cell except jason and chenault was local people but maybe it wasnt so bad if chenault wasnt listening to the others it probably meant that he had heard his own decision in what the others were saying and he was checking himself against bens words after a half hour of argument someone asked chenault what you think we should do chenault pulled his glasses down on his face and leaned forward he spoke so softly that twice his voice was obscured by the flushing of the toilet i think what people are saying is that we have to show the guards were not afraid of them and yet keep them from shooting one of us to do this we have to agree in advance on what things well do and what we wont like whether well work in the cotton fields for them that way were setting our own terms for our existence here and as long as we know that the guards havent broken down our terms were still winning ben interrupted come on chenault get off that theoretical crap and make your point its getting late and that guard be back in a little while do yo uthink we ought to let him have the goddam clothes or not chenault grinned at bens reprimand ok man i got carried away i think we should give him the clothes cause he got the jump on us he made a demand that we werent ready for lets give up the clothes but also lets decide right now on what were going to do while were here so well be ready next time whew thats right give him the clothes and live to fight another day they agreed to give up all their clothes except their shorts there were some halfhearted jokes about chenault who didnt wear underwear and a final agreement that he should keep his pants they also agreed on what they would do if the guard tried to take chenaults pants from him jason stacked the clothes near him at the front of the cell and then rejoined the discussion on how they would conduct themselves while they were in jail they decided that they would not work in the prisons cottonfields that they would not let themselves be separated for any reason and that they would have only the necessary communication with the guards ah thats better firmer ground we know what were going to do still such a depressing place though cant even see anything through that little window up there blocked by a tree jason relaxed onto the bunk and rested his head against the stone wall from here he was the first to see the dull grey uniform of the guard who was bellowing something about handing over the damn clothes why the clothes are right down here cant he see them oh that vain mothagraber cant see anything cause hes watching his own shadow must get a kick out of digging the outlines of his power the shape of his gun and the lines of his billystick next thing you knew hell be cracking that whip in the air like a damn lion tamer finally the guard dragged his eyes away from his shadow and into the cell his glance bounced off jasons naked chest and down to the pile of clothes his mouth contorted into a smile so you niggers decided to act like you got some sense thats good cause i aint gonna take no crap off you your white friends aint here to help you now better get in your mind that you dont run this place i do now gimme them clothes and he reached his hand into the cell jason jumped back offended by the moist mealy texture of the guards hairy arm as it brushed past him when no one offered up the clothes the guard just stood there grinding on his cigar and shifting his eyes back and forth between the clothes and the naked prisoners as his eyes became accustomed to the darkness he recognized that chenault still wore his pants withdrawing his arm and pulling his pants up over his stomach he shifted his weight so that he faced chenault nigger you think you better than the others or something i said for you to take off them clothes chenault answered quietly we agreed that since i didnt have on any underwear i should keep the pants well it aint my fault if you dont know how to dress looks like i gotta take them pants off you as he unlocked the door and entered chenault and the others locked arms to form a chain roughly stepping on jason and the others near the door the guard tried to get in close to chenault muttering curses he tore at chenaults pants legs pulling his feet out and suspending him in the airjason tightened his grip on the arms of the fellows next to him burn me will you well you wont win this time you aint getting those pants for several minutes the guard pulled at chenault and the prisoners pulled back all the while kicking at the guard when it became obvious that the guard would not remove the pants singlehandedly the prisoners began to laugh and to sing the guard continued the tugowar from time to time he would drop the bottom half of chenault onto the bunk and try to attack the prisoners with his whip but the cell was too cramped and the space between the bunks too narrow for the whip to have any effect the pulling and kicking and singing continued until jason heard laughter from outside the cell he looked out and saw two other guards they were covering their laughter with looks of mock solemnity need some help in there joe one asked the guard threw chenault back up against the wall and wordlessly made his way out of the cell when i need your help mothagrabers ill call you he said to the other guards and stomped out of the cell block c c they slept that night on the steel bunks and concrete floor without benefit of mattress or cover each was awakened in the winter night by the extreme cold the guard had turned on the large fans in the wall when he left the cell block the next morning jason heard a great clamor he opened his eyes to find the guard banging on the bars with his club behind him a black trusty was standing holding an armload of striped clothing get your asses up time to go to work here some clothes for you to put on hope you wasnt cold last night were not going to work for you chenault answered as the guard digested this news jason observed a violent purple color rise up his neck by the time the purple reached earlevel it seemed the guard would explode he belched out one great stinking burst of air and with obvious effort reigned himself in alright he muttered through clenched teeth dont work but if you dont work you dont eat you wont last long you be begging me to let you work and he marched off with the trusty behind him this time he turned on the heat as he left the cell block along with the others jason tried to recover the position in which he had finally been able to get to sleep during the night his limbs felt as if they would never come straight again might as well twist myself back up between willie c and these bars maybe get another hour of sleep before the heat builds up but chenault would not let them go back to sleep he sprang up and went briskly to the commode relieved himself and rinsed his face in the wash basin as he washed he called out alright fellas cant let this place get to us you can go back to sleep later if you want to but at least get up in the morning he then went throughout the cell coaxing each fellow up and over to the wash basin he got some of them to do exercises with him they did pushups and climbed up the bars yodeling at the top like tarzan and yelling back insults to those who laughed at their physiques then chenault organized a game in which each man gave a lesson to the others in what he knew best they had a high school biology lesson and instruction on how to drink threefifths of whisky without getting sick for jasons benefit there was a demonstration on how to plow a mule in turn jason described advanced techniques for shoveling snow but despite their diversions the full force of the heating system made itself felt the cell became stifling and the only relief was the rush of air which came from flushing the toilet around eleven oclock although it seemed to jason that it must be evening the guard returned getting kinda hot in there maybe you all should come outside to the field cooler out there no one answered but out of the comer of his eye jason saw willie c lightly nodding his head seeming to agree with the guard the guard noticed this too and centered his attention on willie you mighty young to be in here with these bad niggers boy you traveling in company that gonna get you in real trouble why dont you come on out and work some wont give you no hard job let you be the water boy here have a cigarette jason stared in miserable fascination as the cigarette was proferred when willie reached out his hand jason spoke up dont take it willie we agreed we wouldnt have anything to do with these guards the guard smiled at the rift you gonna let this new york nigger tell you what to do he just using you for his own plan he dont care nothing bout you here have some but willie had been shaken by the reprimand he lowered his head humph the guard snorted as he left jason saw the disapproval in chenaults eyes as he studied willie he must think this could become a serious split in the group so soon hope he can pull it back together placing himself in the open space by the toilet chenault sat down with his legs crossed under neath him and called to johnnie one of the older fellows let me use your dice johnnie i saw you put them in the corner when they came for the clothes johnnie handed over the dice hey ben chenault said lets shoot some craps ben showed his yellow illcaredfor teeth in a generous grin and came over to stand in front of chenault jason always enjoyed ben especially at times like this when he put on his mock stance of authority one blacknailed foot jutting forward his hands spread out before him like fans and his big black stomach protruding out over the white shorts his huge eyes glittered round the cell capturing the attention of the other prisoners for whom the coming exchange was designed he peered down at chenault and affected a lisp nigger you knows you cant shoot no crapths i thought i taught you a lesson bout dat last mont at the staff meetink ben is a smart cat putting on that lisp to accentuate the difference between his ninthgrade education and chenaults graduate degree must know it helps the other fellows to identify with him chenault smiled up at ben you took my money last time but i had been drinking a little ben slapped his stomach and rubbed his hands together well he said you axed for it he came down on one knee pulled his own dice from the waistband of his shorts and cast them onto the cement floor they began to play with ben using his own loaded dice to set the pattern of the game he would allow chenault to win would beat him mercilessly and then would woo him back into the competition by allowing him to win again the mood of the spectators bore an inverse relationship to chenaults success in the game when chenault was winning they were quiet and pensive when he was losing they were loud and playful joking about how hot it was in the cell and how mad the guard had been yesterday all around jason fellows were proudly chiding ben for cheating chenault out of his money though the mood became so easy that even willie c joined in the catcalls still no one spoke directly to chenault they joked to one another about him referring to his grand theories and to his disinterest in underwear but he remained essentially offlimits jason noticed that although no one spoke to chenault everyones gaze was directed at his kneeling figure they really want to get at chenault must be feeling some resentment at him for leading them into this mess matter of fact if hadnt listened to him wouldnt be stuck in this ugly place why dont they go on and laugh at him thats what he wants well dont mind getting on him got a few bones to pick myself man jason said to chenault if you cant play any better why dont you get the hell out of the game you know you aint good for nothing but thinking chenault responded immediately jason i know you aint talking to me why i picked you up out of the card room at harvard and made a man out of you if it hadnt been for me youd a been playing rummy for matchsticks with a bunch of lazy students right now grinning jason retorted you made something out of me man if i hadnt been around to keep you out of trouble youd a been dead right now just remember back to the time when you let the staff leave you on the drew plantation without even a car to get away said we should depend more on the people if i hadnt come and gotten you you would have been buried under that sharecroppers shack and the man still wouldnt have been registered to vote humph talking about all youve done for me you cant hardly take care of yourself jason turned to the others do you all remember when miss suzie mae was after him everyone laughed yes rev johnson he asked how did chenault get that scar on his shoulder and having opened the way for the others jason leaned back on the bunk rev johnson answered in his best pulpit manner well way i remember the thing miss suzie mae had been chasing after chenault here for a long time she used to come over to the office and fix food and clean up for all of us just so she could be round chenault she be there sometime at six oclock in the morning and stay all day someone interrupted shouting out you forgot to say how big she was oh yes rev johnson said she was twice as big as chenault could pick him up if she wanted to wasnt bad looking didnt have much hair on her head but still she looked all right had a husband that worked on the railroad anyway shed come over all the time and chenault would try to give her stuff to do to keep her busy he was shamed to have her cleaning up for him and all so hed send her canvassing give her books to look at everything yall remember when he tried to teach her how to type she couldnt hardly read and he was gonna make her into a secretary put her in front of the typewriter told her he knew she could do it and said type course she didnt never learn to type but she always acted like she was trying hard a least for as long as she could keep her mind off chenault well he tried his best to keep her busy but she always would come and say she was through a half hour after he give her something to do and she just kept trying to get him to bed with her affirmation from the others yeah thats right she sure kept after him rev johnson went on after bout two months of this chenault started getting weak i remember he started to giving her a job to do and then going out the back door so she wouldnt have no excuse for not doing it but she would catch him in an hour cause she knowed everywhere he could go in that little town so finally he just gave up and let her take him home rev johnson swelled up on his toes bent his back and hollowed his shoulders all the while he was spreading out his arms so that to jason he looked like a great eagle when he had reached his full expanse he clapped his hands together sharply hah and then do you know what happened enraptured cries now you coming to the best part what happened next reverend tell it like it is and fleeting glances at chenault to assure that he was not angry well time chenault and miss suzie mae got in bed time they got they business done and had got off to sleep her husband come slam ming through the door home from the railroad cheers slapping of knees laughter chenault jumped outta the bed and went through the window miss suzie maes husband come on after him with his gun and grazed him right there in the shoulder and you all know chenault dont wear no underwearand didnt have time to put on no pants all naked like that he couldnt even stop nowhere and ask for no help had to run all the way back to the freedom house and we got him out of town that night now satisfaction and remarks to prolong the story yeah thats sure how it happened man when i saw chenault sitting up at the house all naked and mad as he could be i laughed so hard it hurt and then to chenault chenault why you wait so long til her husband was ready to come home fore you got you some ass his head tilted back and his green eyes sparkling chenault answered i was afraid he was going to come followed by more gushing spluttering laughter which finally subsided into a general atmosphere of relaxation now a reservoir of unacknowledged emotions was released jason heard his own fears echoed by the others he too was worried that they might have to serve their full fiveyear sentences and he had begun to doubt that the workers on the outside would get the bond he had become afraid that he could not last long without food hearing the others and reassuring them that things would work out he began to feel better himself it even seemed a little cooler in the cell the crap game having served its function ben returned the dice to his waistband and announced chenaults debt of chenault admitted defeat as he stood willie c called to him chenault what made you think you could teach miss suzie mae how to keep the office and type and all willie i guess i just thought i could do it i thought she had talent that shed never had a chance to use before and that i could give her the chance to develop it and do you still think that yes the days thereafter assumed a common pattern jason suffocated in the heat during the day and in the cold night he shivered for hours and berated himself for having willingly come to this filthy place it would be late in the night before he could sufficiently exhaust his mind and body so that he could finally drop off to sleep then at five the next morning an hour or so after hed gone to sleep he would be awakened by the guards demand that they go out to the field to work daily the prisoners refused to work the guard would then announce that they would get no food and would stomp out of the cell block followed by the young trusty with the armload of striped clothing as the days passed the guard demanded more intensely and angrily that they go to work but they continued to refuse in the mornings having been completely aroused by the confrontation with the guard jason would give up his efforts to sleep and would drag himself over to wash his face he would join in the exercises and singing and the games and would lapse at times into a fitful sleep through it all he was encouraged by watching chenault who seemed to be thriving in the dark musty cell he was awake and washed before the guard came banging on the bars he would rout out the others and would laugh and talk with them throughout the day he seemed to be tuned in on the moods of the other prisoners when jason himself became irritable and depressed it was chenault who appeared next to him on the bunk reminding him of an eccentric teacher they had had in college or sharing with him his plan for the movements growth in mississippi chenault confided to him in these discussions that he had found his lifes work in the civil_rights struggle if the movement succeeded his life would have been well spent if not it would have been wasted for him every demonstration every confrontation with the whites was intensely important because jason realized how important it was to chenault that they emerge from the jail as an unbroken group he would set aside his depression and would try once more to talk and joke with the others for four days the group bore the discomfort and the hunger with only a minimum of prodding and encouragement but on the fifth day some began to weaken and with the weakness came insecurity and fear there were arguments in which some battered against the logic or refusing to work and to eat a few began to fight over who should play with the dice or who should have to sleep on the floor instead of ignoring the guard when he came around some began to whisper stealthily with him worst among these was willie c three times in one day jason saw fellows pulling willie c back from the bars so that he could not whisper with the guard when this happened the guard cackled happily and sauntered out of the cell block c c c c c on the seventh night of the fasting jason was surprised by the familiar nasal voice of the guard he did not usually come to harass them late at night he unlocked the door and intruded his massive body into the cell willie c his voice twanged i got something for you want you to come on with me jason watched unbelieving as willie c slowly rose from the bunk he grabbed the boys arm to restrain him but willie c shook loose and followed the guard from the cell amid the curses of the other prisoners jason struggled to understand willies action why would the boy do a thing like that c c c sje the next morning willie c was installed in the empty cell across from them the young trusty brought him a mattress blankets cigarettes tobacco candy and a tin of food while the guard watched willie c climbed into the striped uniform after the guard left willie c tried to talk with ben hey ben them guards aint so bad they didnt hurt me none just talked to me a while and give me all these things look i got a mattress and this salt meat dont taste bad after a week of nothing but water ben surveyed the faces of the others hes trying to decide how to treat willie everyone but chenault seems to have frozen up guess that means theyre going to ignore willie c dont know much about this kind of thing myself better watch chenault follow his lead nervously breaking the silence willie c offered some of his new possessions hey yall want some candy how bout some tobacco i got cigarettes and tobacco cause i knowed yaild want some ben i knows you likes to smoke here catch he threw the can of tobacco and a package of wrapping papers across the aisle ben did not reach out to catch them and they fell just short of the cell ben willie c implored they right in front a you pick them up thats a lot of tobacco ben announced i dont want nothing from you and turned his back to the boy chenault came to the front of the cell his eyes moved methodically to willie c to the other prisoners and back to willie c lets talk more about this he said hmm thats odd normally hed let the fellows fight something like this out among themselves wouldnt step in the middle of it like that must really be worried that the group will fall apart this time its silly to try and ignore willie vhen hes right across the aisle from us chenault continued why do you think the guard put him there no weve got to work this thing out ben said aint nothing to work out he rather do what white folks tell him its all right with us but we aint gonna have nothing to do with him but ben chenault said maybe willie didnt really do anything bad looking into willies unhappy eyes he asked besides taking the mattress and stuff from them did you do anything else willie what did you talk to them about last night willie c at first evaded chenaults question mumbling and pulling nervously at his blanket his silence was met by the derision of the others hes so dumb he tole them everything he know and in falsetto voice willie did you tell them how much you love white folks probably gave them some ass while he was at it with each accusation jason saw the anger rise further in willie c trembling he flung himself against the bars just had to fuck with me didnt you he shouted alright i tell you what i did i signed a goddam statement that chenault was corrupting the morals of a youth by convincing me to demonstrate and get put in jail when i didnt want to do it now laugh bout that laugh bout the years chenault can get for that how could he do that to chenault thats a hard charge to beat chenault might have to serve those years what could be on willies mind chenault must be furious chenaults manner did not change he spoke softly thats rough willie but we can get the lawyers to work on it when we get out what worries me is why you did it try to explain ii just dont understand willie c answered cause i was hungry and he that guard say some things last night that was true and he told me i just had to go long with him and i could have some food and a mattress and all chenault said what could he possibly have said that was true willie well like he say bout i dont have no say over what we gonna do just always do what you tell me say yall just using me using you how could you think that willie what have we ever used you for you know last year the machine willie answered machine what machine last yearthat was before i came chenault had turned to ben in apparent confusion ben whats willie talking about i dont remember any machine jason could feel a discomfort among the others they shifted their positions and stared hard at the floor what could be so bad about a machine why are they so emm barrassed rev johnson said maybe explain some other time ben after we get out of here goddamit johnson ben said its time for chenault to know if he always want to know everything he got to take the bad with the good now do you want to tell him or you want me to do it well rev johnson said i guess its better for me to tell it chenault willies talking about that time last year when you tole him you was gonna make him the project director to take your place you remember you and him was running round buying him a desk to keep his papers in and you was introducing him to the people from the north who was raising money for the project so he would have contact with all the resources you gave him books to read and youd sit next to him at dinner so you could talk to him bout the books and bout how things should go when he took over afraid you got him all excited bout how important he was gonna be you remember now of course i remember that chenault said but what did it have to do with any machine chenault ben said you supposed to be so smart but you dont see nothing plain and simple you found out it was too hard you found out you couldnt give willie eight years of education in two months he couldnt do research on the power structure of the state til he learned how to write he couldnt follow your logic cause his mind didnt work that way and you cut his ass loose you put him in the back of the office in the storeroom gave him a tube of ink and made him the director of the mimeograph machine and you made it worse by telling him that running that silly machine all day was very important for the movement had everybody tipping round trying to make him feel better by asking him to please make them a hundred copies of something had them tipping round like that when everybody knew that he had flunked out everybody knew willie wasnt shit thats what the fuck he was talking bout oh no poor chenault so willie cracked because of him in the painful silence chenault closed his eyes and slowly nodded his head how could he make such a mistake and willie he must have been miserable to have hoped for so much and ended up with a mimeograph machine chenault spoke haltingly his old air of competence gone now thats aa problem ill have to work on i must have misunderstood last year but the problem the problem for all of us now is willie hes only seventeen seventeen we cant expect him to think like we do and im afraid its clear now that he had some cause to do what he did maybe it was my fault i accept the responsibility for his actions thats foolish ben said you cant take the blame for willie hes a man been doing a mans work since he was fourteen and he got to pay for his mistakes like anybody else chenault could not answer covering his eyes with his hands he withdrew into the shadows of the cell for the rest of the day the prisoners argued over willie c chenault said nothing he only sat balled up on the floor rocking back and forth when some of them began to drop off to sleep jason came over and sat down on the floor next to chenault he felt bound to share chenaults miseryas if sharing it helped knowing no words he could only stare into chenaults brooding face sometimes catching his eye and trying to smile at times he would clasp chenaults shoulder and then he would be shot through with the thousands of tiny vibrations which racked his friends body he welcomed the darkness and the dulling whir of the fans late in the night jason heard an unfamiliar sound over the noise of the fans next to him chenault raised his head he too had heard the sound it was willie c crying chenault breathed oh no and he shrank back against the wall pushing himself into the stone away from the sound as jason sat helplessly search ing for a way to relieve his friend he heard voices above him he distinguished the soft voices of rev johnson and two of the younger fellows they called across the aisle willie hey willie what you doing over there didnt know you was woke man you aint crying is you willie aint nothing to cry bout boy we have you outta there in no time make that fat guard so mad he throw you back in here with us bad niggers

inregard to the human rights struggle i see the negro college as a sp ecial institution isee the negro college as standing in u peculiar relationship to that struggle iam often told that this is a pred ominantly negro college not anegro college they mean that there are per cent or per cent negroes etc isay this is a negro college meaning by that that prec isely because of the black predominance there is a prevailing ethos which pervades the negro college campus an ethos distinctive to that campus this ethos this spirit if you please comes precisely out of the context of black experience black tradition black heritage this ethos is a function of the fact that most of the black students in that college come from a particular so cio cultural environment characterized by its deliberate exclusion from benefits and services of the larger society this environment this exclusion this resultant ethos cannot be treated as if they did not exist or as if they were not relevant they are precisely relevant to the kinds of courses we offer to the kinds of faculty we hire to the kinds of administrators we hire to the kinds of goals we seek in our haste and quest to make middle class people out of black students we have probably overlooked the f act that those black people have insights that we should heed insights indeed not only about themselves and their background but insights about the nature of this society in which we live and i am suggesting that perhaps we have constructed an academic curriculum on some assumptions we have not been entitled to make such as the desirability of the middle class goal the efficacy of white oriented control the desirability of a calm objective posture vis a vis civil_rights i say that we must start now to tum to black people students faculty etc to find out what their insights tell us about what kind of college we should have to tell us to explain that black oriented ethos so that we might hopefully become more relevant let me cite professor kenneth b clark on n this in an article he wrote in ebony for august this article is based upon the assumption that it is possible for an american negro social psychologist to understand certain aspects of the american culture and the psychology of whites with somewhat more clarity than is generally possible f or whites who are accepted by and completely identified with this culture it is possible that a negro who has been trained in the discipline of the social sciences may be less influeenced by certain subj ective distortions which are operative in the american culture or he may bring to his view of this culture certain counterbalancing distortions the negro in america by virtue of the pervasive patterns of racial rejection exclusion or a token and often self conscious acceptance by a minority of white liberals has been farced into a degree of alienation and detachment which has resulted in a pattern of social and personality consequences among these consequences has been sharpened insights and increa sed sensitivity to some of the subtle forces which are significan t in our complex social structure we would prefer to reject or overlook these words of professor clark because they are revolution ary they challenge they require us to reexamine some of our established beliefs and values and traditions and assumptions but i propose a black college revolutionary inits purposesrevolutionary in its procedures revolutionary in its goals i propose a black college which would be for the first time legitimate vis a vis that distinctive ethos not in relation to a larger white anachronistic middle class i propose a black college that would quickly understand that western technology is not the criterion of greatness advanced technology is merely the development of material comfort yes and expanded life but of what value is that comfort if the citizens in the black belts and the black ghettos are systematically denied it no human society would do that only a sub human one and i do not propose a college that would graduate students into sub humanity of what value is the knowledge of medicine that extends life when political decision makers snuff out lives of defenseless women and children in vietnam oh no no human society would do that only a basically sub human one and so i am not impressed with the advanced technology the skyscrapers the gigantic communications systems the modern sanitary facilities when i see the lack of nj odernity in that societys relationship to oppressed peoples i am not impressed with a society where in black college graduates with one year of postgraduate work can expect a lifetime earning of while a white male high school graduate can expect to earn i propose a black college that would do many broad things educationally it would not be bound in all disciplines and especially my own of political science by the basically irrelevant gres for so long we know that higher education has not dealt with the role and function of the black man in america now they are trying to catch up to become relevant some law schools are adding courses on landlord and tenant before it was only corporations and property some schools are scurrying around trying to establish urban studies centers as if they can research their way to a relevancy to the ghetto i propose a black college that would not only study the ghetto but get its stud ents from there that would prepare its students to go back there to assume roles of leadership i propose a black college with specific courses in economics e g economic coops in the ghetto political science e g viable political movements in the ghetto business administration eg the business potential of the ghetto etc i propose a black college that would offer summer and other season in service training for students who would prepare themselves for leadership in the ghetto communities by living in and organizing in those communities i propose a black college that would make the history of african civilization at least a three year course and required for graduation i propose a black college whose curriculum goal would be relevancy to the lives of the students and their experiences i would not be concerned about the question about the gres or the question what kinds of jobs would your graduates be prepared to perform these questions would not concern me because they are embedded in the context and parochialism of yesterday and today i am talking modernization i am talking tomorrow and tomorrow we know that only those with relevant educations will be able to save this sick society from chaos my graduates would be called upon because they and only they would be the true dr doctors the larger society has failed to meet the needs of the ghettos we know that some time ago mr henry nichols of the philadelphia school board its vice chairman said that per cent of the black high school graduates in that city are fun ctionally illiteratethis results he said from the fact that phi ladelphia has in effect two school systems one for the black ghetto the other for the white society i propose a black college that would graduate students to go to that city and hundreds like that one and organize to challenge and change that despicable situation i propose a bl ack college that would deliberately strive to inculate a sense of racial pri de and anger and concern in its students i propose a black college where one of the criteria for graduating summa cum laude would be the demonstrated militancy of the candidate this may all sound silly it may sound ou of order but you see i operate fromthe point of view that too many of us have been inorder for too long i propose a black college that wouldbea felt dominant force in the community in which it exists a college which would useitsaccumulated intellectual knowledge and econcmic resources to bring about desired changes in race relations in the community a college that wotld offer free remedial training and education for black adults and school drop outs a college that would be intimate friends notfoe to the black citizens surrounding it a college that would do business only with thosewho hired its students and contributed a certain predetermined amount to the colleges scholarship fundsi propose a black college that would embark on these programs not fearful of reprisals because the college i propose vould seek its raison detre not in the sanction and approval of others but in the sanction and approval of its black students and their black parents and again i know the question will come where will you get the money what foundations or governments will support you my answer may seem naive but i would rather close down my college than cut down on my principles if that cut meant kow towing to those public or private who would impose unacceptable conditions on their grants because you see in the final analysis only a man who is his own man can be a legitimate man i propose a college that would insist first on being its own manbefore it attempted to go into the business of educating men and women i propose a black college whose faculty and administrators would be on fire with the desire to eradicate human injustice a college whose faculty and administrators would reject the shibboleths of objectivity and aloofness because they would know that these are merely synonyms for passivity and irrelevancy i propose a black college then that would adopt as its preamble the avowed purpose to pose the hard questions to challenge established myths a college that would feel ashamed of itself if its graduates did not become active fighters for human dignity and social justice a college that would recruit as students those freedom fighters in the same way that some collegestoday recruit football players i propose a black college that would grant honorary degrees to the paul robesons and john hulletts of lowndes county to the amzi moores of cleveland mississippi to the mr mcclains of nottingham penna i propose a black college that would hire a fannie lou hamer and welfare mothers as professors of social action a college where ferment was a reality not superficial rhetoric a college that would see an alex melton of west chester and charles butler of coatesville as times more legitimate in community organization than full professors of political science and sociology from harvard yale or princeton i propose a black college that would recognize and utilize the talents of these people as surely as some colleges now bargain for irrelevant phds it is clear in my mind that there are very few legitimate places in this society where we can expect militant outspoken protest to originate the negro college must fill that vacuum it must be relevant in a way that the church has not been in a way that labor unions have not been in a way that socalled liberal groups have not beenthe primary role of the students at that college is to be a student to study to prepare frankly i do not expect the students to be on the front line action actively leading that time for them will come later the active leadership should come from the faculty and administration that is why this human rights leadership course this year stressed teaching and studying there are no exams in this course the test will come when the students have already graduated and are living day to day in their respective communities how will they relate to that discriminatory school board how will they fight discriminatory employers and real estate brokers these will be the tests and i assure you no greater no more important examinations will be taken in our time and people will ask what about accreditation and i will answer our relevancy and legitimacy will accredit us how crtditable can the present system be when it cripples hundreds of thousands of black students annually my final thoughts are these i am quite sure that we are in a stage of history which is confusing and bothersome to many people it is a stage of dynamism calling for militancy not moderation calling for manhood not mediocrity the old language the old cliches must be thrown aside we must not follow the philosophy of edmund burke and be afraid to make changes we must challenge the future and reject the past we must not cannot march into tomorrow on the drum beats of yesterday we must march to a dif f erent drummer we must not approach these burning issues as if yesterdays formulas were valid we must exp eriment we must innovate we must declare our modernity and our manhood there will be those who will accuse us of being hatersthey will accuse us of being segregationists we will be accused of being passionate and subjective and intolerant and they will be right we must be haters of injustice we must segregate ourselves from ignorance we must be passionate about our desire our will to be men we must be intolerant of all those who would counsel caution the negro college is oneof americas few legitimate bastions of relevancy if it fails there will be created a vacuum of leadership not to befilled in this or succeeding generations the problem is ju st that serious the burden is just that great i gave a talk at northem illinois university in dekalb illinois recently and some one asked if you are so alienated why dont you and your kind leave the country there are many answers to this but the most important one is this country needs its alienated people in point of real fact going back to kenneth clarkwe have insights that can help save this society that can help civilize this essentially sub human society this is a job for the militant not the moderate not the middle ofthe roader protect your relevancy with a passion and centuries from now history will record oh yes in the latter half of the th century the most meaningful voices came from the black college campuses those voices those campuses were intune with the future they perf ormed the function of clarity and conscience they pointed up viable alternatives when many others slinked low and proceeded cautiously the black colleges were the avant gard e the black colleges provided the insights that got the society through a terrible turbulent period and that historical account will be very very correct the afroamerican student is currently being swept up by the whirl pool of a merican racism he is continuously confronted with degrading images of his self and supremacist images of whitesin many cases the feeling of inferiority is instilled as early as age three through the childsfamily and environment later the elementary and high schools reinforce inferiority feelings to such an extent that by the time the afro american youth is a freshman in college all that is needed to complete this black automaton of inferiority is the embellishments of academic manifestations of racism hence a charlatan carbon copy bourgeois is molded with superficial thoughts of individuality steeped in judeo christian pragmatic concepts such as competitiveness is the thing the bourgeois negro is too sophisticated to stab his brother on friday night liberalistic subtlety bestowed upon them by their synthetic teachers only allows them to run away from their brothers their crudeness and their horrible rat infested environment to be a black bourgeois is to be at once trying to become vice king of the whites dunghill and acting like the fly with rape in mind on the elephants back in the afro american students quest to reject himself and his brothers he loses what potential power he has he begins to conceive of power as a cadillac a light skinned straight haired wife a suburban home and a perfunctory job with some white supercorporation power becomes the pursuit of happiness where happiness is material wealth designed to be obsolete in a matter of a few years money is the manifestation of power they fail to see that the richest black american can be eliminated by any white person who calls him a nigger his humanity is nullified through that one act the students mental energies are expended attempting to secure the proper image mannerisms voice characteristics and sexual attitudes of their white colonizers they are constantly restraining from exposing their primitiveness that is their soulfu lness their sexual life istom asunder trying to hold on to the judeochristian concept of spirituality sansfleshbut beingblack does not makeevery young afro american frivolously frenetic the rise of militancy there are those afro american brothers and sisters who are becoming increasingly aware of themselves and of the depth of racism of america many of the blackmilitant students frequently of middle class background can be physically identified by their proud carriage and naturalafro hair style the black militant student frequently is a science or psychology major comparatively few political science and humanities students become militant thereare reasons for this it appears thatthe political awakening of a black student varies inversely with the amount of exposure he has had with academic political science and humanities the less he is exposed to it thewestern political and humanitiesscene the more his political potentiality seems to have a chance of becoming actualizedwestern political and humanitarian thought is entangled in the briarbush of objectivity and individuality in the naive or nonaware black students quest to be less sinful and evil that is to be less black he assimulates and acculturates he becomes more of an american than the white man in his drive to be white he overcompensates ultimately he becomes an apolitical being aloofly viewing the world from the underside of the white mans pulverizing ivory tower the non aware black student becomes narcissistically infatuated with gaining knowledge of the world whereas in many cases the non aware black student who is a science major will have the po tential to absorb various types of political and cultural systems more unbiasedly than the arts student he is potentially able to visualize contradictions within the american society because of his acquired ability to reason deductively the rise of black militancy means that students must consolidate a pr ogrammatic national approach to their particular needs and goals within the black liberation movement they must communicate frequently with one another for this to be eff ective the militant black student needs a central point of view and dissemination what is needed is a national afro american student association which initially serves as a clearing house for communication and national coordination this type of structure allows for a diversified but cohesive approach so necessary for the liberation struggle black student groups must approach their particular problems through a national and world viewpoint we must begin to realize that racism prevails everywhere in the world in many different forms students at tuskegee institute use techniques of liberation suited to alabamas style of racism while angolan students use other techniques nationalizing the black student movement brings a sense of black solidarity the student as black militant grassroots or no roots the black students role in the movement is vital and varied first of all he must continue his education dropping out of school to work in the movement in many cases is romantic escapism from a reality difficult to face up to because we have less than six per cent of our high school graduates going to college and more than half of that number female we have to try to keep brothers from dropping out if the school is not educating well and the student realizes it dropping out wont solve the problem and he will not get the necessary technical education in the movement or on the streets we are almost obligated to stay at a jive bourgeois college and attempt to get as much information out of its educational f acilities as possible and attempt to reveal to untogether brothers and sisters the real happenings in the world or if at a white college the students have accessto all kinds of information from their library and other sources not ordinarily available to blacks the black student as militant must know how to identify and communicate with himself and his brothers in the street in most cases from whence he came he must be willing to sacrifice and to assu me responsibilities howard universitys newly formed black_power committee has issued aims that can be adopted by black students on the whole the overthrow of the negro college with white innards to raise in its place a militant black university which will counteract the white washing black students now receive in negro and white institutions our goals revolve around the complete revamping of the negro college moreover wemust have a complete overhauling of the pres ent curricula and the building of courses of study more pertinent to the present and future demands of the black struggle in america and the world at the same time it is necessary to launch a vigorous campaign to change the names of black un vers t es to commemorate the courage and deeds of black thinkers and theonsts the feasibility of converting fed erally funded howard into a black militant university is another story what is more important is that the brothers at howard appear to be ready to deal with the issues for example to deplore the vietnam war and overdraf ting of black americans is not enough we must begin to form alternatives to the draft black students can help in setting up local black draft and recruitment centers where brothers and sisters can come to join the black army which will initially be fighting a nonphysical wadare that is voter registration psychological warf are organizing political blocs freedom troops for the work in the backwoods of the south and the north etc another goal of campus organizing should be to encourage students to continue their education for the sake of building an intellectual communitythat would turn create an ideologyof black liberation for america and subsequentlyfor the bandung third world campus chapters of the afroamerican student association will need a pan hellenic committee to find ways to utilize the black fraternal orders which are national in scope and black in body it has been shown that as black racial relevancy becomes accepted by the students as their position the black greek orders initially for selfish reasons want to participate in the movement when the localfrat chapter begins to see the seriousness of racism and the need to have a sense of self awareness then it is time to put its power and unity to work militant students should not fall into the trap of just condemning black greek orders for their bourgeois behavior they must be shown their contradictory stand and what role they can play in the movement as a fraternity another goal should be finding methods to achieve better understanding and cooperation between afro americans and africans even today there is a tremendous amount of reciprocal animosity between black americans and africans achieving this goal is a long and arduous task that will take years of re education and personal contact black students on white campuses the militant blacks who go to white schools must suffer through a frustrating dilemma their soulfulness will be forced out of them and sucked by those weird apolitical ofay radicals to add salt to the wound the black students on white campuses frequently have to try to develop miles and miles from soulville a black community as a result they tend to overintellectualize and romanticize the struggle so that when they come home it is often difficult for them to relate to the harsh nonintellectual and very unromantic ghetto reality the prevailing hang ups of black militants on white campuses are of ten due to association with the new white left the new left is apolitical because of its p ragmatic mindless outlook which makes them shirk their necessary theoretical duties being the most tangible and immediate model of radicalism many new left concepts are adopted by the militant blacks they get caught in vicious rhetorical arguments about academic nationalism and other esoteric trivia to help clear the air of these consequences the militant black students should communicate more with the nationalist brothers in the black communities correspond andor visit the black colleges which have miitant groups and take some of the vacation time to work with some nitty gritty community group in this way the amount of abstract objective intellectualiza tion of black reality will be kept at a minimum a final word as we have seen before his power can be utilized the black student must find himself and then deal with the hang ups and pitfalls of being black in americahe is forced not to be pragmaticmindless within a pragmatically paranoid society he is compelled to be theoretical when society dictates anti intellectualism in short the black student is swimming upstream with weighted boots he must strugglewith his bourgeoisaspiring brothers who arein the vast majority and yet he must come to grips with endemic racism the black student should under stand his relationship to and his usage of violence the violence within us should be channelled for positive intellectual development the violence within us should not be contained in the senseof the judeo christian concept of containment displacing aggression we neither havethe time nor the need to displace our aggression fists and brains go politicallytogether in the make up of a militant intellectual in orderto substantiate our theoretical and therefore intellectual positions we must oftentimesflex our physical muscles inshort wemust fight our use of the various levels of violence dependsonour knowledgeof political expediency timing we have to view the future from a probabilistic basis the way we actualize our theories is dependent upon what we expect to gain from its specific use if we use method x or y we must know its consequences and alternatives we cannot forget that struggling for survival is no game the oppressor knows this violence is no toy violence plays a vital role in the colonialists strategies of dominance where political sophistication subtlely bludgeons the oppressed into a state of almost hereditary despondency indeed when we begin to utilize our various levels of action we must never forget that america has institutionalized violence to the extent that it is strategically generated by and through its culture this is one of the reasons for example why sncc failed to successfully politicalize lowndes county alabama they were playing romantic games while the system computerized their most probable routes of action what does this mean to the afro american student america is not the world and racism does not confine itself to america ultimately it means that the af ro a merican student m u st think he must observe analyze and synthesizeand yet he must be subjective enough to allow his spirituality to grow and become functional in the strain toward racial relevancy and black liberation indeed to be black is not enough and to be bitter is not enough to know of our magnificent black heritage is still not enough we must become dedicated militant human beings continuously questioning the roots of society in a word black humani sm throughout our land a sad voice tells of a terrifying loss regardless of the mourners words to the contrary we know that they suffer an unspeakable grief for you do not lose a habit a friend or even a god with out learning something about pain life and death of ten this new knowledge forces us to look inward seeking a new arrangement of the old familiar feelings and thoughts in order to find strength to carry on with this thing called living for life must be lived and somehow we know that joy will follow pain most men have this faith and meet their days with this belief yet there is the voice that tells of a great lossgod has died and man must create and find him anewi n free to live free to die holt rinehart and winston by malcolm boyd we hear the voice of an episcopal priest who now functions as chaplain at large to u s university students boyd has left the established sanctuary of the suburban church to become a part of the alienated and by the alienated i mean the beat crowd the hippies and the negro whose alienation from american society began with his arrival on these unhappy shores boyd goes beyond these groups though he tells us about the middle class plodders and the jet set covering such a vide range of social types his ministry seems to have taken on a one man personal contact type billy grahamcrusade perhaps it is not the people with whom he associates that marks him but the way he seesthem and he sees them through the eyes heart and mind of an adolescent such a perspective regardless of the personal intentions or sentiments is unbecoming tragic and sterile lets look at this new breed of minister he usually is disgusted frustrated and spiritually tortured by the middle class congregation he serves he finds that his congregation is more concerned with buildings organs pews and missionary work in far off places where good is effortlessly and safely done his congregation can be stirred to great compassion and a few tears by the suffering of the oppressed hungarians the starving indians and the brutalized vietnamese the negros hostility violence and voiced hatreds have all placed him beyond the pale of the deserving for in order to receive christian charity the recipient must be humble deserving and eternally grateful to his benefactor otherwise the benevolent christian receives no confirmation of his goodness and his right to give above all the christian must have his guilt assuaged by the humble gratitude of the recipient the gians are telling us something quite different from what their words imply it has nothing to do with god or gods simply it isthat their world no longer exists this world view ran roughshod over most conflicts and indictments the world was soon to be cast in the mold of the legendary revered peacefulness and righteousness of wellington ohio or any ice cream social saturday here mothers were loved beyond reason and human capacity protestant churches exhorted sinners in abstract irrelevant terms making sure that none was offended nor saved for all in all god not only smiled on the town square but favored it above all other squares name of the game is im the boss and dont you forget it it is no wonder that few young men enter the ministry todayfrom those who have we hear that god is dead you cannot help but wonder how ministers would be aware of such a death since the majority of them follow their congregations this pronouncement revelation or reasoned conclusion would be hilarious if it were not tragic for it reflects the extremes to which a people will go to preserve a delusion a particular madness that prevents them from confronting themselves with what they are or as it may be from seeing themselves as far too many others see them by announcing the death of god these ministers or theolo the schools were staff ed by dedicated teachers not noted for their intellectual strength but devoted to perpetuating the myth although the social studies taught in these schools was little more than a highly fictionalized romantic rendering of the world and its people it perpetuated the myth it placed the wellington ohios and their values in the center of the uni verse negroes and all other colored people were viewed as something inferior and naturally god ordained it so these black unfortunates served a good purpose they reaffirmed the myth and all the values surrounding it ironically and outrageously these people believed that everyone else in the world shared this delusion or at least coveted it even today many americans cannot believe that this myth is not shared by all even when told in plain direct language that their myth is the nightmare of others they dismiss the blatant horrible consequences of their myth and speak of the need to communicate and how do two men communicate when one denies the others dignity equality and suffering at the same time the one denied his humanity has learned to hate beyond his own understanding first he learned to hate himself now finding some pride and selfrespect within himself he has learned to hate the enemy today the enemy happens to be white now the only difference between the white mans hatred for the negro and the negros hatred for the white man is that white hatred has become institutionalized as an acceptable way of life it is seldom spoken except by the not so lunatic fringe there are many defenses and arguments given to protect this right to hate such as property rights not now and thats how people are but to stand and tell a man that you hate him is just not the american way the expression of any true emotion seems to set off a tidal wave of apprehension throughout the land we are far better at hiding our feelings than expressing them consequently we pay the price for this concealment for having never learned to live with our emotions we have learned to be at their mercy this insanity has no bounds and recognizes few contradictions we are quite willing to send our sons and daughters to fight and die for the alleged freedom of a people we would not want to live next door to there have been few south vietnamese refugees settled in this country i wonder what the reaction of our god fearing anti communist americans would be if souh vietnamese refugees were landed in san francisco to be resettled in california or alabama if such were to come to pass we would see riots taking place that would make watts seem like a trip to disneyland and oh the justif ying slogans words and arguments i do not want to give the impression that saturday night in wellington ohiois a second rate heaven that it is not for as quiet as it is kept the people in wellington are quite human they do all the things that any other people do all of their human acts however never force them to examine themselvesand to discover what they are it isas though all of their human frailties have received divine sanction a blessing thathas been denied all others especially all otherswho differ too significantly fromthe people of wellington some young americansliving in the wellingtons and suburbs of our land are fleeing to hippy towns and raising hell on university campuses another sanctuary of the polite manner and myth the world being what it is today many young americans know that a great sea exists between what they are told to believe and what they see happening around them this is a crushing and sad experience for the young for youth is a time of dreams hopes and strivings to make the impossible possible the beauty of it is that for young people brotherhood and love are not dreams but luring realities some of these young people have chosen this reality they have denounced the hypocrisy of their leaders and elders in strange and certainly not always sane ways they seek a new world a world that self interest fear and the old myth will not permit in their communities it is important to remember that these young people are primarily from middle class and upper middle class families so they do not represent in any large number the negro or any other minority group in america it is also interesting to note that when they are attacked it is their dress and personal hygiene that are denounced their use of drugs often brands them as being irresponsible and no doubt some of them are just as some of the good people in wellington are regarding drugs in america the question is not whether they will be taken but when and under what circumstances for it should be common knowledge that the use of tranquilizers in this country is probably rivaling aspirin consumption and that is no small habit those young adults experimenting with drugs were introduced to them in their respectable homes in the form of tranquilizers of a thousand varieties what is significant is that few people answer their charges and indictments of society what has all this to do with malcolm boyds ministry mr boyd and all his kin seem to have abandoned the source of the problem the problem resides in all the wellington ohios and suburban communities in america that drive their young from them if america is to survive it cannot be saved by ministering to a few thousand adolescents and young adults the young adults are running from their homes it would seem that these homes are in need of spiritual rehabilitation if the core is rotten this is where you will find the worn but here it takes courage patience and a dedication that only god can give any minister who sets this as his task must be willing to suffer all the abuse that an irate myth wed christian can hurl upon him and believe me these christians have been practicing cruelty since they threw the first pagan to the lions to awaken a people to what they are is a thankless task but to show them what they can become and to help them achieve it approaches divine gloryon the other hand for a minister to flee to social limbo and join the outcasts is the easy way out it is the missionary of the pre world war ii era all over again and no doubt the results will be the same totally irrelevant obviously mr boydmust plan to become an eternal adolescent for in the hippy joints and other farout places we find the young rarely do we see anold beatnik time cures many things and it inflicts a special malice on the young it is adolescent and uselessly so to tell us that men are free to live and free to die to recite the sufferings of the prostitute the lifebored jet setter the oppressed negro and other human beings without giving some hope or some explicit value is true abdication of all responsibility to tell us that men suffer is not news many children know this and so do most adults to dream of a better world without moving toward that world is the right of adolescents but it is the bane and tragedy of mature men no it is not the reverend boyds of our generation who give me hope for the future for this kind of ministry discourages hope the battle is not being fought in the village or in the hippy section of san francisco it is being fought by a few silent souls struggling with their suburban congregations attempting to get across the real meaning of christianity and denocracy the young people on the hippy kick aside from a few lifekilling habits are trying to find themselves they will make it alone unless i am totally wrong there are many who are thankf ul for the boyds his kind of wretched jargon like prose and meaningless intentions this kind of ministry reassures the establishment that all is well and they need never fear no great threat to life limb or sacred habits will come from the hippy section the reverend boyds of the world are there if middle class america represents the strength and backbone of our nation then middle class america must accept a large part of the responsibility for what is wrong with america and on this score i refer to negroes and whitesfor the time has come when income will probably shape social attitudes just as surely as race of course this only means that negroes can go mad too and heap all the abuse they have suffered on others regardless of the criticisms that we make of the middle class it provides a large share of american leadership and so called opinion setters if we are to change social values in america we must start here to start anywhere else is to abandon the problem although it may be a special christian habit to exalt over the conversion of one soul it is a totally irrelevant act belonging to the personal realm what is threatening our very existence as a people and a nation are certain basic attitudes about our fellow men and ourselves it is meaningless except on a very limited personal level to speak of saving a few individuals all the angels in heaven may rejoice but it does not alter our foreign policy our racist attitudes our indifference to poverty and our grasp of what is happening in the world to convert a hippy deserves as much praise as it does to convertan episcopalian to a presbyterian the real conflict and struggle lie within the social attitudes and values that cut across all of these artificialreligious barriers reverend boyds free to live free to die ignores the real battlefield and the real enemy perhaps in fleeing the real challenge of his time he may find and save himself but little else will be salvaged n the prefatory pages of fine clothes to the j ew hughes explains the blues have a strict rhyme

presents a conflict between life and art one that need not exist oceolas choices and actions tell us the blues are aligned mostly with life their source and the arbiter of their form art is here represented by a disciplined career devoted to old masters and old forms life by love and marriage and by immersion in duties to ones self and community art is associated with entrenched vealth life with youthful vigor art never transcends life embodied in dora ellsworth art merely offers from its hoard of cash the blandishments of convenience and privilege trying to draw away lifes vitality and induce it to f ollow the rules by which art claims its superiority life in the person of oceola jones sings itself in blues and jazz in harlem ignores artistic east rd street raises no brows at bottle

apartment the aging vhite woman tells romantic tales of old france and out of her childhood love sings simple french tunes her husband never tried to understand the two sing together and mrs ellsvorth ventures to sing spirituals loneliness and unappreciated sensitivity then have wrought in this austere woman the certainty that what she lost a beautiful life can be found only in art art so good that it is better than most life and better therefore than most people hughes at twenty one knew that this concept was not true he tossed one form of art his books into the sea the closeness of the blues to sensory life appears in the unforced selectivity of oceolas mind as she summarizes her past for her patron she remembers mobiles delicious roast pig and the large mouth of billy kersands the minstrel leader who let her as a child place both hands inside it the relevance of negro experience to blues and jazz is the point in her recollection that her parents both musicians were run out of

heartbreaking blues and jazz of paris dawns in as hughes describes them in the big sea the young poet found his first prolonged incentive to tum jazz into poetry music at the grand due obviously inspired to a negro jazz band in a parisian cabaret in the crisis december but the source of his earliest jazz poem of unquestionable merit jazzonia the crisis august is less definite at all times after leaving mexico in however hughes responded to the music which lent its name to the this is the first half of jazzonia a poem apparently written a little after the weary blues and one of the three shown vachel lindsay it opens with an ecstatic union of sensory and spiritual faculties with vocalic suggestions both rapturous and solemn the next stanza gives dual recognition to the exotic thrust of jazz its then strange extravagance is drawn with cubist sharpness but kept expressively realistic through the picasso like image of the jazz mens six long heads massed and tilted its sexuality is colorfully emphatic in the enticing dancing girl allusions to eve and cleopatra add depth to the theme of allurement and several interchanges of adjectives before tree and rivers fuse the readers perceptions in apt anticipation of the concluding lines inawhirlingcabaretsix long headed jazzers play the other poem that impressed vachel lindsay negro dancers appeared in the crisis in march its vigor and rhythmical exactness are fully represented by the opening stanza spoken thu after a second stanza on the cabaret atmosphere of the brown skin steppers and a third that reads like two snaps of the thumb at white onlookers the poem ends with a repetition of the opening three lines except for the second stanza the poem is notable for its precise rendition of the dance that captured the verve speed and abandon of the jazz age and enthralled paris in the persons of many negro dancers especially josephine baker lenox avenue midnight the next published in the series of hughess best jazz pieces appeared in the weary blues recorded as the expressions of a negro womanit partially explainsjazz the rhythm of lifels a jazz rhythm the second stanza indicates that jazz like rain and street sounds can vaguely mirror human woes the final this poem a sof tly finger popping affirmation of life that makes the laughter of the gods somewhat irrelevant survives the effect of its middle which reflects a rather different consciousness and speech negroservantaddsapictureofjazzasdrumsoflifeinharlem after dark and salutes the music with o dreams songs saxophones at night elsewhere the poem evokes memories of african drums and veldt jazz is the after hours music of oppressed people o songs that do not care a repository of dreams and half buried recollections of a vibrant culture once theirs the meaning of jazz to the musician is combined with racial background in trumpet player in fields of wonder jazz is honeymixed with liquid fire and the trumpet player says the poet at the end never knows upon what riff the music slipsits hypodermic needleto his soul finally to the musician trouble mellows to a golden note the first third of the poem outlines the negro musician tired eyes smoldering with memories of slavery hair tamed down the weakest stanza shows the negros longing for the moon and sea as old desire distilled into rhythm the quoted lines and a few others reveal the true distillation jazz made precious by its long and sacrificial birth while writing trumpet player hughes was fully abreast of the new be bop music emerging from mintons playhouse in harlemamong the poems inspired by be bop a rhythmically complex and experimental kind of jazz characterized by dissonance improvisation and unusual lyrics the best is the lead off dream boogie in m ontage of a dream def erred keeping up with a changing harlem hughes is alert to the hip insiders elastic jargon as well as the generations old truth of negro life the dream deferred dream boogie perfectly fulfills its purpose wasting no word it has variation in mood ease irony sarcasm and terse jovialty it mixes old devices of the dramatic monologue with a contemporary boogiewoogie beat its rough hewn grace adds power to its clarity jazz poems can reveal jazz even less than blues poems can reveal the bluesthe strict form of the latter provides some agreement between poet and reader yet followers of bud powell dizzy gillespie thelonious monk and charlie parker can respond with extra enthusiasm and sureness to the be bop and jazz poems in the public alliance of poetry and music so challenging in the case of jazz poems hughes has been a pioneer on october he told harry elliott of the lawrence kansas j ournal world i did poetry reading with a jazz piano including fats waller in harlem friends homes in the early s his reading to glee club music at princeton in was part of a more public tradition that he was firmly establishing by then the greenwich village and san francisco beat movement of the late s was an extravagant development of hughess lead ifin his evolution as a poet shown in his volume hughes was restricting himself to folk material and to experimental and folk art methods a warning mixed with praise in reviews by saunders redding in new york h erald tribune book review march and by babette deutsch in the new york times book review may the restriction was purposeful restriction is the subject of the blues the fountainhead of jazz and the tuning fork of the negro soul a true blues or jazz poem is an expression of this very restriction modified by intimations of how negroes transcend it believe ill do a little dancinjust to drive my blues away and oh silver treeoh shining rivers of the soul are exact reflections of negro soul its supple power to overcome demoralization its gift of recognizing the flow of spirit inside kindred forms to be true the intellectual content of such poems must be aborted the lazy stomp of a jazz step and the sudden hey pop re bop interrupt the squash thought and reason in an irrational world of color prejudice for the folk negro to think is not to be negritttde the negroes own soul world that centralized hughess purposes in the s is the american counterpart of the burgeoning concept of african negritude launched in the following decade in the magazine black student and developed principally by two writers of african descent aime cesaire then at the ecole normale superieure and leopold sedar senghor the sorbonne student who was to become president of the republic of senegal african controversy over the term negritude will probably rouse an exploration of its american equivalent yet to be distinguished yet to be named this american negritude once defined and compared with the african personality and the black mans identity as phrases indicative of cesaire and senghor will remain traceable in the works of hughes its foremost exponent if american negritude can be tentatively defined as that complex of traits sensibilities and historical consciousness peculiar to black americans a study of hughess poetry alone can yield the outline of the concept the importance of skin color for example is revealed in negro me and the mule nightmare boogie and letter from spain his earliest soundings of this theme are serious respectful negro which appeared in the crisis in january and opened the weary blues identifies the negros darkness with the night and with the depths of my africa it gives negro color specific moral and physical strength dream variations manages to invest negro darkness with a fairyland grace and relaxed beauty in hughes expressed the world wide implications of this obvious kind of negritude his letter from spainaddressed to alabama the nine stanza poem quoted in part in chapter i opens with we captured a wounded moor todayhe was just as dark as me the versified letter shows the quickening bond of color that resolves differences between the dying african and his negro interrogator m ontage included nightmare boogie opening with the poets seeing a million facesblack as me his dream turns nightmare with a quizzical twist as the f aces all are suddenly dead white and boogiewoogie music is blaring a derisive razzing tone sharpens the anecdotal joviality and hardens the condemnation of color prejudice another component of negritude is related to skin color but not limited to it the sense of a particular beauty possessed by negroes the earliest printed poem on the subject is my people in the crisis june a six line piece which straightf orwardly declares the beauty of negroes faces eyes and souls but the earliest written poem on the subject is when sue wears red quoted in chapter i in which the sweetness of a brown faced girl wearing red is made both timeless and regal by references to ancient egypt and its queens the authors most sensuously conceived expression of this theme is harlem sweeties in shakespeare in harlem typical linesflow easilythe softly bouncing rhythmcarries different pulses of adoration the candy stocking eagerness of manhattan whites touring harlem cabarets and the keatsian rainbow abundance sensed at a negro beauty pageant an important trait encompassed by negritude is durability reflected by dilsey in faulkners the sound and the fury and emphasized by hughes all of his life mother to son in the crisis december begins the strong matriarchal portraits found in hughess poetry and fiction this poem using homely images like tacks splinters and tornup boards shows a poor negro woman instilling her own persistence into her son the same unconquerable determination imbues the negro mother which in furnished the name for a sequence of goldentair press broadsides decorated by prentiss taylor and marked by hughes with instructions for dramatic recitation the negro mother which drew a tearf ul platform embrace from mary mcleod bethune when hughes read it at her college shows how the speakers dream like steel in her soul and her faith in a free tomorrow for her races children have helped her endure mistreatment and exhort youngsters to march ever forward breaking down bars in the early s spirituals compares a negro mothers durability to the firmness of tree roots and mountains and still here asserts resistance to all attempts to make the negro speaker stop laughin stop lovin stop livin negro durability is elusive to the understanding as a psychic phenomenon and hughes waited till the middle decades of his career as a poet to explore it of the two poems in fields of wonder in which hughes makes this attempt burden shows almost mystically the psychic pang common to negroes oppression adds brief explicationthe dearth of dreamsfor dreamers songs for singers songs that will however break their jails three verses suggest the singing tension of nearness to the rational ideal so often shattered in interracial encounters into empty retrenchment or silent impasse clearer more admonitory lines appear in montage harlem asks what happens to a dream deferred and gives alternatives it dries up like a raisin in the sunfesters sugars over sags or does it explode ends the poem remembered partly as the source of lorraine hansberrys title for raisin in the sun harlem traces in figurative language the long scar of psychic abuse which might it emphasizesdevelopafatallyeruptive itch an expression of negritude important in the s is the recognition of african heritage hughess poems strongly voicing this heritage however belong mostly to the early years of his career about half were written or published in the early s during the ascendancy of marcus garvey whose weekly negro world extolled african history and whose black star line black madonna black baby dolls and revived backto africa

admits that only history books and african tunes in strange un negro tongue preserve memories of it hughess later role in perpetuating those memoriesisforeshadowed his final appro ch to negritude concerns negroes historical consciousness of their american past its best and its most detailed poetic expressions appear at opposite ends of a thirty year stretch of creativity in the chapter of the big sea named after the first line of the negro speaks of rivers hughes tells how and why in the summer of he wrote this perhaps most often anthologized of his poems one that is a boys testament of love for his race hughes newly aware of the spiritual strength of migrant southern negroes and feeling emotionally cast out by his estranged parents received melancholy inspiration from the sunset gold upon the mississippi he was crossing by train submerging that feeling into thoughts of mighty rivers in his ancestral past an having wrestled all day with the problem of hatred of negroes so vocal in the father who awaited him in mexico he reconciled his isolation in a river like fusion in which history became rebirth self justification and veiled prophecy the jines first written on the back of an envelope began the poem thus ive known rivers ive known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins my soulhas grown deep like the rivers i bathed in

after j ohn brown dwarfing previous poems in its very purpose prelude to our age in branch library book news of the new york public library for october mentions over sixty persons known in negro history and related o ganizations and events negritude then referring to negroes various traits and sensibilities and emphasizing their feelings about their beauty durability and history defines itself in hughess works with as much clarity as the national mind brings to the concept basic details stark outlines nuances all are revealed they amass and enliven a tradition as much literary as sociological in its implications and a final aspect of negro soul is widely perceived though seldom fully comprehended humor according to hughess introduction to the best of n egro h umor even negroes especially writers and publishers often undervalue its uses hughess own uses of humor ample in his personal conversation and in much of his work can be only minimally surveyed in this approach to it in the light that it throws on negroes the combined uniqueness and utility of negro humor has long been its power to conceal and transform the uniqueness deriving from the magnitude and the persistence of the concealment the common theme of the mask then has an uncommon significance as expression of negro soul hughes labored early to express his sense of the tightness of the mask when

exhortation much later two poemsin one way ticket life is fine and juice joint northern city show how the authors more elastic humor moderates the grimness of the mask in the former poem the mask a shivering protestation that life is fi nefine as wine is clapped on by the speaker after his discovery that suicide in a cold river or from a high window is strenuous here the mask is fitted out of nonracial circumstances but the expression itself mixing blues and boogiewoogie style and italicized racial accent is negro juice joint uses the interruption of a blues song by a sudden dance step to

the dramatic monologue madam and the phone bill in which alberta k refuses to pay for a call she took from a boy friend in kansas city her character and her plight are deepened in madam and her might

for yourself alone the humor that enlivened the authors fiction at the start and increasingly marked his poetry of the s settled deepest in his prose one night in in a harlem gin mill near his st nicholas avenue address hughes received the most authentic comic inspiration of his life he overheard the man who was to become his own fictional jesse b semple explaining to a girl friend his job of making cranks in a new jersey war plant in reply o hughess question as to what the cranks cranked the negro worker shrugged i dont know what them cranks cranks you know white folks dont tell negroes what cranks cranks his notion of a separate white world his engagingly fresh diction while objecting to it became a study of the author during their many later bar stool conversations while hughes took boswellian notes after the conversations a literary character was being born who represented the flesh and spirit of harlem a folk hero sprung of the common black man he was a whole personality when hughes found himself arguing with him at the typewriter while the worker was miles away his vivid reality on paper now had the dimensions that would earn him full comparison to huck finn mr

to that word black the protagonists sense of negro beauty is evident in his ravishment by all shades of feminine charn the durability of the race is stressed in hughess everpresent still here theme in

trenchant his suggestions about a sisterhood week f or the protection of white womanhood devoted to the realistic commemoration of lynchings is reminiscent of the great english satirists m odest prop osal humorous style in these books is not easily separable from content close study of them reveals about a score of distinguishable topics humorously illuminated by simples talk and about the same number of separate styles of humor the equal marriage of content and style in the humor is shown by the fact that about half of these styles are funny because of the comical light thrown over the topic by the rapid versatile play of simples folk mind the authors most typical subjects all broadly classifiable somewhere under racial life are simples character revealing background and present attitudes and imaginings his race consciousness and intermarriage his most typical styles of humor are derived from verbal play long lists comical ways of starting the miscellaneous truths of discrimination and tall tale exuberance a deeper analysis of the simple books should be made it is worthwhile sociologically to synthesize simples comments on american delusions white liberals foreigners negro leaders and the south it is profitable estheticallytocomprehend howingeniously he extracts humor from absolutely odd notions expressed and implied etymologies turnabouts and the illusoriness of race itself these effects and topics are also found in short stories imbedded in the simple books especially in a dog named trilby and in a veteran falls the best ones

issue i would have please pass the sex in red headlines after the third simple book a minimu m of a hundred and twenty nine reviews were available in periodicals and newspapers forty one of them foreign and hughes soon accumulated thirty or so personal letters of commentary reviewers placed the contents of the books in twenty one different categories ranging from snippet to tale to novel the various judgments boil down around the truth of the book jacket phrases jesse b semple is indeed a major figure in american literature for every negro there is much in him to love for every american

face a shiny oval under his derby and the vagabonds saturday night clothing mixing skyblue honey brown and the swinging gold of key chains adds comical garishness an epistolary story written the sameautumn passing deals with aphenomenon tragic and humorous butthe humor of it did not show in hughess fiction until then at hollow hills farm he wrote another story of the same name derived almost exactly he said in conversation from an experience shared with aaron douglas and two or three other writers of the s published as whos passing for who in in negro story for december january the story recalls the harlem renascence night that an interracial group had some confused fun brawling meandering and ultimately guessing one anothers racial identities the humor is satirically aimed at the pretensions of the harlem literati and their white friends redheaded iowan stubblefield fightsfor a blonde struck by a negro only to find that she is the mans negro wife the other iowans negroes by their own gradual conf ession declare at the end from their cab were white we just thought wed kid you by passing for colored the negro writers are appropriately left at the curb throughout the story they have remained superciliously on the edge of the harlem stage that caught the imagination of white manhattan and faraway negro artists the writers snub everyone not privy to the mysteries of gertrude stein man ray and jean toomer they ignore the works of the previous generation even james weldon johnsons they too are passing and they know it well but negro soul as visible in the facts anecdotes and subtleties of passing is not revealedto any depth inaccessible to overt wit closely reading passing in the ways of white folks one sees much irony and anguish in this old american custom hughes finds comedy on harlems sophisticated sugar hill patron of the arts written not long before the spring of but first published in the langston h ughes read er tells the end of a love affair between a young oklahoma artist and a green eyed harlem charmer over twice his age in a typical scene darby reminds cornelia that her husband might interrupt them with firearms let him she cries first well mix a cocktail darby abstains seeing him speedily donning his coat she threatens suicide but she pours a drink for herself instead the humor is smart with embarrassed pose bright dialogue and tables turned hovever the story reveals little that is distinctive of negro spirit but the story has the most beautiful humanizing touch in hughess fiction cornelias final small note asking darby to take his painting of her back to oklahoma to remember how your patron looked transforrns her without it she would have been just another aging woman trying with cosmeticswardrobe cash and someone elsesinexperience and need to soften the hand of time with it she seems thoughtful and sensitive wishing for her young man no doubt in vain a return to the innocence of his drawing board she wants him to remember her in his maturity not as an older woman who lied about her age to be with him but as mrs oldham his patron who had some respect for art the works discussed in this chapter suggest the magnitude of the young hughess vision of his task as a writer they indicate the versatility of his spiral approaches to the negro soul life and love inside and outside the veil of color become subjects as wide as the authors sympathies yet as specific as artistic integrity alone can make them in every division and subdivision of topic that marks the boundaries chosen the author has produced work worthy of either admiration or respectful study in a tribute written soon after langstons death playwright loften mitchell touched on a part of the poet which i believe deserves particular emphasis it was his refusal to play the role of top negro or the literary house nigger he grew up in an age when the greatest accolade for a black man was to be the first negro this or that having won the mantle you were supposed to guard it zealously against any threat posed by other negroes working in the field you didnt actually hire someone to go out and shoot him down or crack a few ribs but in each prof ession there were appropriate techniques employed to keep the next soul brother down at a safe distance langston who had risen by long hard years of steady production knew how poverty stricken we were and how desperately we needed to fill the vacancies at the top and all along the line by everybody who had the talent to get there so he spent a disproportionate amount of his working lifewhich might have been devoted to self agrandizement helping young artists get a foot in the door i doubt if there are many black writers of my generation who did not on one occasion or the other use langston as a reference when applying for a fellowship or a foundation grant and i would suppose he holds the worlds record in writing letters in support of such applications langston even passed on assignments he might well have done himself although until recent years no black writer received more assignments than he could handle for example in the late s a prestigious national magazine asked him for an article on the numbers game in harlem not long before i had published my first novel which had to do with the numbers so langston said he was too busy and put my name forward as the expert he could have dashed off a better and more inforned piece in minutes but he knew i needed the money and the exposure there are many writers who had the same experience langston would not mind my saying that he was not the best critic in the world he felt such a deep commitment to the cause of black people everywhere that he found it terribly difficult to draw his literary razor against another brother he wanted us to get ourselves together i have lived several years in the africa he loved so much and i know that it now lies prostrate and despite all the trappings of national sovereignty and independence is being subjected to merciless rape by the white world largely because it has not got itself together in the arab israeli conflict as these words are written in june we have just witnessed a dramatic and tragic demonstration of what happens when one people are united and another are not here at home those of us who have managed to get before the public spend so much time tearing each other apart that it is refreshing to think of the splendid example our poet set all the days of his life he knew that the longer we kept at each others throats our real enemies would have nothing to worry about getting ourselves together this is one of the many lessons we should learn from the life and work of langston hughes on this page in the february issue of negro digest and on another page in the march issue of this magazine we called the attention of black writers to the fact that the national foundation on the arts and the humanities had granted for the publication of the first american literary antho logy the editor of this anthology george plimpton was delegated to select from the little literary magazines the works fiction poetry criticism essays which he deemed worthy of republication in the anthology each prose writer will receive and each poet will receive it is a way of course of rewarding talented writers whose work has not yet been recognized by the big slick magazines and the major foundations we warned black writers that since few of them are ever represented in the little magazines they would be effectively boycotted by the new anthologies we suggested that black writers who feel their work worthy of publication in such a government subsidized anthology write to the national foundation on the arts and the humanities and voice their objection to the method of selection of material for the anthologies at the same time we wrote to the director of literary programs for the national foundation on the arts and the humanities and inf ormed her that we considered the proposed anthologies discriminatory in their conception we pointed out that unless such magazines as liberator freedomways soulbook and black dialogue also were considered as sources for material for the anthologies black writers would be ex cluded from participation in the program yes under the circum stances we also listed negro digest as an important source for ma terial to be considered for the anthologies a few black writers did take the time to write to the national foun dation on the arts and the humanities to protest what would be inevitably the exclusion of black writers from a government subsidized project the response in washington however amounted to a sneer since the complaints were so few and so feeble there was no need to take them seriously well apparently the selections have been made for the first anthol ogy which will be published by farrar straus and giroux early in and there has been no confrontation petween the black writers and the people responsible for the anthology needless to say complaints are useless after the anthology has been published and now negro digest learns that has been granted for publication of the second american literary anthology with the same fr plimpton designated as editor so black writers have a second opportunity to voice their obje ctions to the eff ectivc exclusion of black writers from this government sub dized project will the black writers remain silent or will they speak up in chorus the address of the national foundation on the arts and the humanities is g street nw washington dc mrs carolyn kizeris director of literary programs we repeat the officials involved in the publishing project insist that there is no deliberate discrimination against black writers and tech nically this is true however none of the magazines classified as little are published by black people and black writers with the exception of ralph ellison james baldwin and occasionally saunders redding are rarely represented in the pages of the little magazines since this is a fact which can be proven it is our belief that the pub lishers of the government subsidized anthologies have the obligation to seek out the work of black writers and to give that work equal consideration with the work of writers white represented in the little magazines notes on writers and writing indianapolis

able direction of young dick gaffield oem counter poen is a tiny green jewel like booklet of lovely poems by dudley randall and margaret danner the idea of counterpoem means only that each respective page of poetry by mr randall is opposite a page of poetry by miss danner and that they sometimes reflect similar moods ideas and images as shown in the poems george and the patriarch and in the two belle isle poems all of the poems were carefully chosen which seems a very much more honest way to publish than that of choosing many poems of which only several are considered of merit afewofthe poems were quite well known before poem counterpoem was published among them are ballad of birmingham booker t and web by dudley randall and ill walk the tightrope and goodbye david tamunoemi west by margaret danner miss danners lovely poem a sparrow is a bird and mr randalls souvenirs and the southern road are beautiful poems which seem to reveal a lot about poetic craftsmanship and which as such southern road seems to have all the rich scorching loamy black vitality of the delta and the black belt and of miss danners variegated africa these following lines are from lr randalls poem the southern road to a land where shadowed songs like flowersswell and where the earth is scarier as a scar friezed by the bleeding lash that fell fell upon my fathers flesh f arfar f ar and deep my blood has drenched it none can bar my birthright to the loveliness bestowed upon this country haughty as a star and i set forth upon the south ern road most important of all f actors is that this book was publ ished by broadside press that is sign ificant for poets who are concerned aboutperhaps black_power also it is an off ering by two better know n black poets poem counterpoem sellsfor this does seem rather over priced are nsp r ng when one considers the fact that mr randalls sonorous lines in the southern road are rich in melody and in imagery and in idea it could be described as a protest poem if there were any such thing it has a great deal of power pain and despair the repetition of the line and i set forth upon the poetry is the orphan of the arts nevertheless for those who wish to read a lovely non commercial looking carefully made book of poetry poe counter poem can be ordered from broadside press old mill place detroit fichigan the title of the late langston hughes anthology the best short stories by n egro writers little brown implies a high degree of excellence that is if these are the best short stories by negro writers every one should be of extraordinary merit some of these have this quality others do not those that to me are outstanding in this collection are jean toomers fern zora neale hurstons the gilded six bits cyrus colters the beach umbrella ralph ellisons flying home yerbys health card gwendolyn brooks were the only colored people here james baldwins this morning this evening so soon mary elizabeth vromanssee how they run john a williams son in the afternoon william melvin kelleys the only man on liberty street woodie kings beautif ul light and black our dreams lebert bethunes the burglar and ronald milners junkie joe had some money these are outstanding because to me they deeply engaged the reader either through characterization incident or situation and even after reading they were not forgotten like froth that appears in a womans magazine but continued to reverberate in the memory their style was good and did not irritate through clumsiness flatness or imprecision jean toomer and woodie king were poetic and suggestive james baldwin was elegant and eloquent mary vroman was almost too sweet but the emotion came through gwendolyn brooks was sensitive and perceptive frank yerbys story was extremely powerf ul you forgot you were reading words you were there it would be a stand out in any collection ralph ellisons situation was strong despite straining after symbolism william kelley had a bare simplicity lebert bethunes story was almost too slick but it had a sus penseful f oreboding and it persisted in the memory ronald milners story had the loose rambling quality of some of the other childhood reminiscences but the nervous jagged style fits the situation of a child who stumbled upon a murder and the murderers and who all summer long ran here and ran there kn owing the murd erers were watching him incidentally this story junkie joe is not published here for the first time as stated in the acknowledgements it appeared years ago in a short lived magazine published by the henry brothers of michigan this is not to imply that the other stories were not good some however were clumsy in style some were slight and lacking in density of substance while others though strong in spots were not compelling all the way through others were simply forgotten after reading perhaps it is best to regard the collection as one showing the scope and variety of stories by negro authors all the stories are not on the race problem as one might assume some like arna bontemps a summer tragedy paule marshalls barba dos and alice walkers to hell with dying treat the themes of living loving and dying others like ernest gaines interesting treatment of folkways a long day in november conrad rivers mother to son and rudolph fishers miss cynthe reveal family relationships ronald fairs lusty miss luhester gives a party pearl craytons rollicking the day the world almost came to an end and alice childress biting the pocketbook game are humorous but kristin hunters an interesting social study charles wrights a new day and charlie russells quietus do depict racial relations and confrontations langston hughes has assembled in this book a plentiful assortment of short stories showing a wide range in theme treatment and quality although john a williams beond tle a ngry black cooper square publishers an expansion of his paperback the angry black may be compared to langston hughes best storiel by n egro a ilthors or john henrik clarkes n egro american short stories it differs from these in that it contains not only short stories but poetry and articles as well it is more like herbert hills melange soon one m orning but again it differs because it includes both black and white writers and supposedly has one theme black anger all the pieces however are not angry two poems by gwendolyn brooks and gloria oden show pride medgar evers and resignation man white brown girl although the third poem in the book margaret walkers now does express rage and indignation in the area of poetry this is like hills book in that the selection of poetry is skimpy being limited to three poems both editors apparently being unacquainted with or indifferent to negro poetry john howard griffins dark passage tells how white drivers picking up a black hitchhiker used the darkness and his blacknessto expose their own obscene fantasies about negroes james baldwin puts down the whitebroadway theater in theatre the negro in

learning who he is his own people probably wont accept his work because it will be too painful for them kardiner and oveseys psychodynamic inventory of the negro personality describes both the lower and middle and upper class negro as suffering fron self hatred which he projects onto other negroes the lower class negro hates whites but fears to express his hate so turns it inward upon himself and onto other negroes the street corners and candy stores are scenes of vicious derogatory gossip because the mother is often head and breadwinner of the f amily he is confused about his sexual role his meager family life gives him little opportunity to learn affection and confidence in others even though he tries to effect relationsh ips with others by becoming a joiner he squabbles and tries to dominate his organizations one sees examples of this divisiveness in socalled negro leaders who criticize other leaders instead of helping them upper class negroes have a more secure f amily life but have in tense conflicts about status they want to be white and since thats impossible they hate themselves and everything black many for in stance take pride in not reading negro newspapers or magazines john a williams has an excerpt from a novel in progress navy black which vividly recreates the heat the sun the monotony and the sudden excitements of a base in the south pacific during world war ii as any pacific veteran can attest this is as well done as anything by mailer or james jones hoyt w fullers short story the apostle is full of felt life keen observation and subtle humor the character of the apostle has contra dictions which make him come to life in the pages and he acts in a way other leaders could emulate seymour krims article make it a white cadillac reveals the romantic attitude of whites toward harlem and the negro he is honest and con fessional and admits that even while tasting the excitements of harlem and letting himself be cheated and taken advantage of he still felt secu rity in his whitenessasfor exoticism it works both ways blacks also find something exotic and exciting in a white or lighter skin witness how many blacks who prate abou t the beauty of blackness wind up with a high yellow or white girl friend or wife mr williams warns that h ites have never shown reason in relation to race and blacks tired of having their reasonableness mistaken for weakness are about to give it up he pleads for a step beyond anger for reason before there is a holocaust and includes richard wright s prophetic plea from n ative son which published in is still pertinent today unfortunately he will not be heeded one of the first impressions you get after reading american n egro short stories hill and wang soft cover is that this anthology edited by john henrik clarke is really in keeping with the times what better time to bring to the fore a collection of short stories by black writers the political and social ferment of our times has created an unprecedented quest by black people for a true ac counting of their past if clarkes book did nothing else but contribute to that search by identif ying black storytellers and their works it would have achieved a measure of success however this anthology does that and more in the introduction clarke alludes to another achievement un til recently the contribution of negro writers to the development of the american short story has been sadly neglected true indeed the contributions of negroes to all fields of art and literature have been pathet ically neglected filling the informational gap in the short story field could be regarded as the books greatest success clarke brings together the stories of writers some like langston hughes w e b du bois and richard wright are established by whatever criteria you choose others are not the selections cover several literary periods two th century masters of the short story paul laurence dunbar and charles chestnutt are blended perfectly with authors of the negro renaissance and moderns like james baldwin and leroi jones equally important their works encompass various themes which scale the full range of emotions felt by black people in several centuries of racism in limiting each writer to one selection the anthology leaves itself open to criticism by reducing the giants to the level of the ordinary perhaps a broad survey that successfully lists the contributions of negro writers to the development of the american short story has to reach out and give equal space to the great the good and the ordinary more depth should be allowed though to men like chestnutt hughes and wright the major influences for lesser known writers in short the teacher deserves more space than the pupil still the book is thoroughly enjoyable dunbars the lynching of jube benson is an engrossing and tragic story of a simple and kind negro jube benson who is lynched for a murder he didnt commit be sides its realism the accourt is done in conventional language proving that dunbar could portray white characters with as much feeling subtlety and depth as he could negro folk characters in his more famed dialect poetry instead it is chestnutt often overlooked as a master dialecti cian whose the goophered grape vine is written in that medium though best known as a historian and social critic du bois is at his witty sharply satirical best in on being crazy a neatly woven tale of an unnamed character who confounds his racist detractors with teasing rationalizations in all aerican n egro short stories affords the reader both good entertainment and insight into the feelings of black people from some of the most qualified observers in november trident press published a first novel by a yearold los angeles girl named jane phillips the novel m oj o hand went almost unnoticed which is not strange for there are dozens of unremarkable novels published every season but what was strange was the novel itself a brief uneven apparently biographical tale of an attrac tive young peola possessed with an adoration for a blues singing guitar plucking black man a couple of worlds away from her california upbringing the almost plotless story is all but unimaginable in real life a girl still in her teens travels from los angeles across country to raleigh in search of a man whose music she has heard and loved her luggage includes a guitar which she plays herself when she gets blue and she gets blue often she finds the man in a routinely poverty stricken area of raleigh and moves in with him taking a job as waitress at peon wages in a rundown combination restaurant whore house everyth ing she has which the musi cian will take she gives him including her puny wages it is assumed that she cannot tear herself away from the man and his bed even when he boots her about like so much rubbage he is a god to her when he takes the instrument in his gnarled black fingers and croons in his plaintive voice all manner of her suffering is justified the girl called eunice moves like a somnambulist yielding unlovingly and unrespondingly to men who take herback in califomia she had lived in a middle class milieu but on her mystical journey she adjusts to a primitive life with no problem at all she demands nothing all that is important is that the man known as blacksnake is near her that the creator of the music she needs to hear is however tenuously attached to her there is no evidence that she loves him only that his being alive pro vides reason for her own efforts at survival she does not question she merely is much of the strangenessof mojo hand unquestionably lies in the authorsfailure oftechniquethere is never for exampleany explanation for eunices rejection of everything to seekout blacksnake andthere is no effort to justifya lovely young girls overwhelmingattraction for a physically unappealing and personally unadmirablefolksingerof apparently run of the mill ability how ever absenceoftechnique does not alone account for the almost weird quality of the novel eunice comes alive in the book but she alsocomes through as a fearfullypatheticcreature a child woman already stripped of emotionand devoidof either ambition or a sense of values she wears her life like a looseuntidy garment however janephillips makes up with soulfor whatever she lacks in novelistic technique and development the down at the heelsquality of the towns inwhich her characters move isevoked with thebarestde scription and the words and the be havior of her characters never waver fromthemarkthe world in which euniceseeks out herdrab destiny is flat and cold and rarely touchedby hope sex is easy and liquor runs free and violence lurks and yel there is everywhere a basic sort of kindness and freedom a willingness to confront life as it is a wisdom born of knowing the measure of man and where inevitably man ends toward the middle of the novel eunice tires of blacksnakes abuse of her and packs her battered bag she journeys as far as lake charles before changing her mind and starting back in search of him in lake charles she goes to bed with a gi on leave but does not respond to him the soldier insists on following her back to raleigh and on to south bay where blacksnake has gone to live with another woman she moves in with the estranged wife of blacksnakes buddy now she is heavy with blacksnakes child there waiting she becomes a part of the dockside society of whores stevedores and villagers she finally chases away the soldier who loves her in the end eunice abandons south bay but she does not return to her home and family in california she makes her way back to the crumbling cabin where blacksnakes ancient mother lives alone the old woman accepts the pregnant girl and the books action is over that in any case is a kind of affirmation a decision whatever its meaning but the strangeness of the novel remains the symbolism haunts confusing and indistinct the emphasis on folk music inexpertly done seems in retrospect to have been gratuitous and while eunices choice is baffling it has a logic which grows out of her inexplicable obsession perhaps after all that is enough still jane phillips has produced a work just disturbing enough just provocative enough to make the reader curious as to whether here is an unusual new talent at hand or whether just possibly it all was a kind of desperate catharsis hwf then ilast saw langston hughes he was r off again on one of ge those endless odysseys up to our expectations of what a poet should be even in that segregated school our models for literature and success were white and we were led to believe that a poet could only be white tall with blue eyes and a shock of long black wavy hair we read emerson bryant wordsworth and coleridge and modeled our images of what a poet should be like upon the patterns presented to us by our teachers no place had been set aside in our world for a hughes and to read his poetry and though we were amused and ento make a little of that money which people always assumed erroneously that he had i first met him on such an odyssey he had traveled to our high school in virginia read his poetry and chatted with students and teachers though to my knowledge none of us had ever met a real live poet beforehughesin no way measured couraged by him still we felt somehow betrayed f or a negro poet was as alien to our comprehension as a negro president yet he stayed with us for a short time laughing talking and assuring and then he was gone and we went back to emerson bryant wordsworth and coleridge he was the only negro poet who ever came to us and though none of us realized it at that time he destroyed something fundamental within us despite what our teachers told us emerson bryant wordsworth and coleridge would never again have the same eff ect upon us for though ve had excluded hughes from our minds shut him out like some oedipus still that distorted image of what constituted a literary figure was tarnished if not com pletely negated some time after his visit many of us turned to negro literature for the first time to poems by mckay hughes johnson and dunbar to novels by wright redding himes and fauset at each point of awareness we became a little more embittered by the assumption that our elders had made about us of our eagerness to accept their models withou t benefit of a personal choice we became even more disheartened because there was a world of ours which was so alien to us which had been carefully hidden from us by those who should have been instrumental in revealing it to us in that world were people who shared so many of our own experiences hopes and desires and yes our own anguish and pain the rivers of which langston hughes sang were more real to us than those of limpid blue crystalline streams which flow through so much of english and american poetry the yearning for das fl ie gende stunde the fleeting hour of fulfillment in a world which promised nothing but chaos confusion and death that yearning so peculiar to the literature of the western world was for us most profoundly expressed in hughes johnson and mckay and no poet neither a bryant nor an arnold would ever vouchsafe lines to us which portrayed our feelings of pessimism despair and fear so well as those of langston hughes we cry among the skyscrapers as our ancestors cried among the palms in africa because we are alone it is night and were afraid four months ago at a party given by a mutual friend i attempted to impart some of this to hughes beaming as usual a bright smile lighting up his tired face he listened half heartedly and jokingly emitted some words of thanks perhaps i did not completely get through to him it is difficult to pra ise a man to his face without becoming sentimental but moreover it is difficult to tell a writer that his writing not only made you think not only inspired you not only encouraged you but in addition gave you that strong silent strength which only words can give to one who must face a stronger and noisier world and again it is difficult to tell any human being that his words made visible to you a new universe aglow with promise and hope but perhaps he would not have believed me for years critics had said that he was a simple poet a folk singer a mere teller of tales lacking inprofundity and complexity the message he carried the songs he sang devoid of pathos energy meaning and direction he was a negro poet who could not get beyond hisnegritude and thus they said he could never journey to the universal paradise where the aspirations of men soar far beyond race creed and color like richard wright hughes too was a negro writer and like wright he never denied it therefore readers black and white allowed his books to gather dust on bookshelves to lie untouched upon library shelves across the country from his writings from his public lectures from his private conversations that enthusiasm that love for the people so dostoyevskian in its intensity pervaded everything that he said and for this reason he was like wright an alien a lonely man invisible in the literature of that country which he loved so well and of which he sang so eloquently his was the fate of the negro writer people who knew him by name managed to get his autograph never read his poetry critics who read his writings did not understand it and therefore dismissed it as worthless high school teachers who rushed to any gathering to come into contact with him never taught his poetry to their students middle class negroes who loved to have him a great conversationalist as an invited guest at their suburban affairs never read his poetry aloud to their children the colleges of this country their english departments in particular which have exalted robert burns dismissed hughes completely uttering their synony m for negro writerssimple he has remained alive in literature not because people read what he wrote few have but because of his frequent excursions into towns and hamlets bringing with him in his own humble way the message of a people and yet these tireless excursions these endless odysseys robbed him of that vitality that youth which may have enabled him to last a few years more when i said goodby to him for the last time he was on his way to the university of california a university whose english department would never include a poem of his in its syllabus for american literature to lecture and to read his poetry he was already an old man and the age showed even beneath the spontaneous laughter and youthful joy which attempted to buttress it at a time when white poets and writers of his stature had retired to their estates become seers and honored prophets of literature he was embarking upon yet another odyssey because at sixty five he did not have the not even those he sang so long and so passion ately had rewarded him for all of his long years his endless devotion the negro wrote richard wright is americasmetaphor and langston hughes is the metaphor for the negro writer far more than his poetry his novels his plays and his countless lectures his treatment by the academic establishment is the best example of what it means to be a negro writer in america and in many ways he was more fortunate than most for his name among those of my generation if not a household word is known and respected yet like other rewards posterity will more than likely escape him those footprints which he etched upon the sands of time viii be wiped away no trace left of their imprint barring a mad dash for his books now that he is dead a dash which might have helped to keep him alive in but a short span of time even his name like that of cullen toomer and locke will be unknown to any but those who prepare dissertations negro renaissance the high schools and colleges which denied him in life will continue unless something radical happens to americas educational system to deny him in death and thereby to doom him to extinction f or unfortunately literary figures are kept alive in our high schools colleges and universities another generation of negro youngsters there ore will not be as fortunate as those of my generation will have no choice but bryant emerson wordsworth and coleridge this is the tragedy of america and it isthis which causesthe pain the anguish and the despair voiced by the negro intellectual in the cry for black_power we are denied our own heroes our own prophets our own songsters because of a group of narrow minded insecure little men have determined a priori that such songsters prophets and heroes are not good enough in english departments across this nation both black and white the shroud is wrapped securely around the corpse of the negro writer perhaps they are right perhaps as they argue langston hughes was not a great poet perhaps he carried no message of profundity perhaps his was a simple world unlike and this will come as a surprise to many critics that world of jesse b semple perhapsand yet these are observations which no small group of men should be allowed to make arbitrarily value judgments which should at best be made in concert with those who will be the beneficiaries of the judgment instead critics black and white dismiss the negro writer hand down arbitrary judgments concerning himin the same fashion in which hugheshas been arbitrarily dismissed on the college campuses of america hughes was a negro poet and theref ore inconsequential he was a poet of his people and despite robert bumsjohn millington synge and william butler yeats a poet should not be a poet of a particulargroup of people but of all the people he wrote of drunken negroes of sad negroes of happy negroesof confused negroes in the same veinin whichjohngay wrote of englishmen with similar characteristics yethughes but notgaywasac cused of writing oftrivial things like wordsworth and bums hughes language was meant to be the languageof the people yet unlike his mainstream prdecessorshis verse was labeledsimple yet most negroes know that his verse was not simple neither was hislife he lived the role of the greatesttragedian on any stageand throughout his writing forthe life that he lived that life of joy sometimes and sorrowsometimesisthe life that mostnegroes live few can give voice to their anguish and despair as hughes wasable to do none can so adequately justify the ways of negroes to the world as hughesdoes so well in all of his writings none can keep him safe for posterity for negroes are powerlessto do so against the army of academicians who wait like vultures to dismember his corpse still further his reputation as the poet of the people cannot be kept alive in a world which seeks as we rush faster toward the armageddon of integration to negate the people all that one can do is to remember that there once lived a writer proud to be a negro writ er who never disowned either his heritage or his people a poet who came before us lived amongus and died this is no doubta sim ple commentary upon the life of so beloved and sogenerous a man and yet a commentary undeserving of many of todays writers who have f ound a haven among the english departments in our best universities because asthey point out so vociferously they are not negro writers but american writers in school a fellow english major asked me to read aloud for poems of langston h ughessilce i had acted in a numbr of campus plays late into the night with what turned into a whole room full of students we read and read over again the poems of mr hughes one favorite verse being lulu said to leonard i want a diamond ring leonard said to lulu you wont get a goddam thing this one we felt to be daring enough a shock of defiance for the staid presbyterian walls of knoxville college the next day lulu and leonard were dorrnitory characters it was later and through dr rosey e pool that i happened to meet mr hughes after her visit to the campus she suggested that i write to him and send along some poetry i did and received a reply which was an inspiration far greater than lulu and leonard laterinnew york ifinally met him he was more earthy and warm than ever i could have imagined the occasion was a party to celebrate his acceptance of the spingam award after such a meeting how could anyone re member langston hughes in any manner other than one of gratitude love and warm respect for his gentle person his humor and quality of the completely genuine istillremember his coming over to me and asking what are you having to drink having come recently from the black belt and being in complete awe of s i n i said coca cola he looked at me in his smiling manner and replied a writer cant make it on coca cola it was spoken with the impact of humor i grew to know in him but i could feel the seriousness imbedded within his statement during the party iexpressedmy wish to become an actress a famous actress spoke of the marvels of the stage and said it was a splendid idea and that i should really consider it that writers should be and often were capable dramatists i was thrilled later aswe made our way toward a theatre to hear another writer read from his latest i was enthralled with the idea wouldnt myformer drama director be glad to know his faith inme would be confirmedwouldnthebeproud quietly so that only i could hear theformerlyradiant actress said in an agonized voice forget t its a dogs life follow a professionwhere youllbe able toeat stunned i later asked mr hughes why the lady had added this spirit dampening bit of news dont think hard of her he said she was on an actress is always on every group is her audience every audience is her public she was on what the hell was on he was always most patient with me when people refer to him as a great poet they should add to that great human being for he was the greatest in my keeping are books and cards at many seasons and occasions from mr hughes he never forgot me not as a poet not as a person he respected the efforts of younger poets last october i heard him read at the guggenheim museum two weeks later in the hospital his flowers and cards arrived at christmas and new years other cards arrived from langston hughes whose love for life and for people will be remembered and cherished by many for there are others who can no doubt recall as lovely memories near his door at th street he grew ivy someone did it was the only flowering on the whole street and now i think who will grow the ivy or see that it is there he continued to help the younger poets even through the political discrediting and over the so called gulf of generations he was a fine man a beautiful brilliant and loving man was langston hughes we younger poets are in tum the budding new green of his ivy it is an unfortunate commentary indeed that so many times we fail to realize comprehend the true value breadth scope influence of a person only until after that person has gone from us irrevocably i par tially must admit some guilt in this respect in relation to langston after his passing it fell upon me like a ton of bricks that even though i had known him called him friend that actually i knew little of him about him i had once owned the big sea but had not read it before it got away from me as books do after his passing i borrowed a copy of his second biographi cal volume i wonder as i wander and took it and the langston h ughes reader along with me on a short trip both i read from cover to cover and thus became re acquainted with known facts of langstons life and delighted with the discovery of little known facts had i read previously about his travels my own might have been richer and deeper the fine sensitive creative human being that langston was was brought home to me sampling the read er i savored his poems prose blues plays essays and speeches what depth what versatility what sin cerity what a rare creative soul was langston surely a model superb for all of us who endeavor to create to emulate i first had the honor of meeting langston in the early thirties when we of the negro peoples theatre put on his dont you want to be free at abraham lincoln center he came to smile at and encourage us fledgling thespians then years later with a similar company some of us appeared in his the sun do m ove at parkway house on fifty first street i understudied the role of a strong black woman who stood behind her man against oppression langston saw me play the role and said he thought it was quite good like he had written it of course that endeared him to me however i grew closer to him through my reading of his poems such as ive known rivers the negro mother i too sing america let america be america again and many others which were watchwords for the protest movement of the time in retrospect i find that i am have been most impressed with langstons unselfishness and the con sistent encouragement that he gave to all who endeavored to create to langston it was come on in the waters fine come let me help you theres plenty of room up here tell me what i can do to help you this and much more langston re sponded to our efforts to start an african american museum in the midwest in a real way by sending money artif acts books programs clippings and a rare item his christening robe and cap finally the man the poet james mercer langston hughes will always be loved and remembered by the plain people black and white for he spoke their our language yes he always leveled with us and we certainly did dig him langston hughes lives the young art st whose drawingsare reproduced on these pages is a star example of the caliber of talent resident in the black communities but which rarely receivesthe opportunity for exposure fortunately for tom feelings the pattern failed his work has gained mainstream attention finding acceptance in such wellknown publications as the reporter cover and inside look and harp ers all this is new however back in mr feelings very notable ability meant little when it came to finding work as an illustrator in the national capital of art and publishing new york city in disgust he gathered his tools and flew off to ghana there with novelists julian mayfield he worked on the african review a magazine sponsored by

whats needed now for the arts is to get them away from white people as example of their culture of life finally and all its uses and back where such strivings belong as strong thrusts of a healthy people what we want now is plays of filling in and extendreality commenttheir art all instance ing so called ing altering rebutting it but the same cause life plays of specific finding of human occasion that is where is the confrontation between life and death the wrench of soul and white crap ugliest bring in the image of man and plays triumphant again evolution animals need humanism the humans we will show embracing spiritism we will have plays for city hall at the time of city hall so black humanity will know how we lived how we triumphed plays enabling black people to stop bogus socalled urban renewal which be nigger removal and the repeated disarming of carthage but at the time of and at the place of in the street at the spot where such disarming is taking place have your actors shoot mayors if necessary right in the actual mayors chambers let him feel the malice of the let the people see justice out repeatedly explain evolution plays for the police departmentjew plays

this is to say that we are ghosts too but everything is a ghost whore plays black politician plays plays of the instant of silence in the shoeshine parlor a whole looking for a whole an ascendancy an appearance to break heads and tear down buildings we want a postamerican form an afterwhiteness color to live and reerect the strength of the primitive plays where history is absolutely meaningful and contemporary the first learnings of man while we fly into the next epoch recently in new york a friend of mine handed me an adveri tisement for a poetry reading a card which declared in bold letters black magic black art will topple the citadel of white racist america he smirked as i looked at the card and told me that art wasnt gonna do sh my friend is one of those who believe we black artists should beat our saxophones and typewriters into spears and daggers and each pick out a white pelt and be recorded in history as the black assassin saints which isnt what stokely means by black_power but getting back to the card my buddy had picked the wrong time to try to rile me into an argument on the relevance of art one the new york critical establishment had just hung my play out for targetpractice two in this same day i had seen two brilliant black poetplaywrights of two widely separated generations both of whom were struggling through new york like crippled lizards so rather than going a few verbal rounds with him i told my friend something vulgar and sat down he respected my mood and just shutup and let charlie parker talk well we sat there with bird playing and me wishing for my wifeshe was here on campus or maybe a whole harem or some religion i could believe in or something and i kept looking at this card black art will destroy white racist america i thought about the work of the two writers i had seen earlier of men like richard wright james baldwin and ralph ellison and there was charlie parker on the boxa black man with his art was all that flowing convoluted beauty charlie was pushing considered black magic too would it topple white racist america i remembered a white guy dave lets say in detroit telling me that when he started listening to parker clifford brown and others he knew he couldnt keep on being scared of black cats and in his words protecting myself with the stereotypes so he started making the jazzsets and introduced himself to some black people i think he even eventually went south with one of the rights groups so when charlie led dave to shake hands with blackfolks something had toppled right some preconceptions and stereotypes certainly dave had at least stepped toward that frenetic frightening darkness from which all that music was being shaped good but supposeand it occurred to me because he had all the makingsdave turned out to be one of those quixotelone rangercomplexed ones who couldnt stand reprimands and commands from the supposed sanchoes and tontoes who were now asserting themselves and their own directions and so found it easier to protest for the vietnamese who would not try to regulate methods of positions in the protest one of those totally committed as long as the means and ends fit the terms of their own vision of things but completely unable to understand it when a malcolm_x or stokely c tells them that their physical psychological image goes counter to the needed impact on ripped and selfdoubting black minds that at best he can be a silent partner plotting with black men around conference tables but having his truerealwork to do alone in places like cicero illinois and hillbilly country southern america where at least he can order a cup of coffee and begin to talk to people before trouble starts can even move in and start a club or something suppose dave was one of those who would rather try to protest across oceans than have black men point directions for him still good charlie still had helped topple something within davebroken the godisalwayson ourside idea inspired the step that led to protest yeh still a score for black art black magic if you will i intended to run that point down to my friend but i stopped myself as i anticipated a possible and very disturbing reaction of his there is a bitter line in my play fightin or fussin beggin or cussin you always gotta go through chuck and here immediately i had jumped to that side of the fence to prove a point to establish validity unconsciously automatically damn its enough to make you go vomiting through the house breaking all the mirrors now it is white racist america which must be toppled destroyed the one which exploits race and class denies the truth of mans human sameness to all men not that ideal racialrainbow that now and again incredibly peeps through and has set forth ideas and methods to better mans people to people relationships but that greenbacked red white and bluebellied snake thats the one that has to go now it sits heaviest on the heads of black men and to speak of the black artists power to topple it is to get into the whole idea of black mens selfassertion of black men going and doing for themselves if i were going to say something i had to talk first of what black mens art did to and for black men what it made them feel and want to assert i had to get to why the two of us were sitting there listening to bird as though the room were suddenly a mosque and this music was the chant of the true believers i dont know about my friend ray but when i first heard charlie it was like well let me put it just like it was like all boys i depended on the things i saw and heard around me for selfclarification for reaffirmations of my urges and longings intuitions and impulses to give me some idea of my way of being so i went along fingerpopping shaking my hips doing the chicken getting some little mamas skirt dirty as we rubbed bellies against the wall to one of those syrupy beats you know and in that detroit hasting street environment everything was about like that kind of music in that register with that kind of focuspoint bluesy and groovy you know i dug it it was cool but always i had this frustrated intuitive vibration this sense of never really hearing or seeing anything truly indicative of all that was me or nearly all that footpatting shoulderdipping pelvicevoluting groove was all right but needed some more image some further higher points of selfreflection then i stumbled onto what charlie parker bud powell and others were doing and lo affirmations affirmations affirmations those quick changing rhythms that involved lyricism the shifting harmonies the speakins not only in two or three shouted words but in long flowing complex sentences how can i tell you about the sudden possibilities this music brought to me the ceiling lifted and out went my sense of freakishness here was what i could not get from white movies no matter how good they were here was that intangible difference in the way ernie wagner moved up the basketball court for northeastern high and the way karl kawalski came down for denby high in what seemed so strange and exotic to othersand so real and natural to mein this music was something of the reason why i could hardly get a new hat out of the store before i had to break it down and put that particular pointedjitterbug if you mustcrease in it you see that hat had to start right away looking like where it had to live and whom it had to suit not some designer in some factory yes affirmations and possibilities charlie told me by the particular points and creases that he put to old standards like in the sill of the night that i could wear my felt crown to the white house and not have to stumble all over myself trying to act and sound like i was a fourthgeneration graduate from harvard he crystallized a nuance of being that was very necessary to me i needed that crease in my hat he along with others updated the sound of things added intellect to sensuality sped up the beat so that the footpatting was still there but now it was like the way you stomp out a cigarette when youve got to clear your mouth because youve got something to say and life is racing and most importantly i say once more that this music was one of the things that convinced me that i could be as black as night and hastings street and still be whatever in life i wanted if only i did it well enough they might not play my music on the radio and try to make a joke out of me but someone somewhere would react if i did it well affirmations and inspiration that is what the black artist must mean to the black man speaking of the qualities of himself and his livingplace as truthfully and artistically as he can with no ones standards or acceptance in mind but his own the artist strikes empathy and identification there is the reaction of acknowledgement than the assertion of what has been acknowledged and the changing and topplingfirst inner with the body personal then outward through the bodies social political etcis on its way and if you think that all this sounds very romantic you are right in any revolution or evolutionif youd ratherthere must be the romantic art the wishes and longings must be symbolized and projected the pains and transgressions must be fixed in hated pictures jazzso far the blackest of the artsis probably the most romantic music since brother beethoven gave up the ghost and that is as it should be there is a peculiarly ironic reason for jazz americas most indigenous and significant contribution to art being basically and mainly the work of black men and for jazzmen being far ahead of all other black artists in true selfexpression and assertion that reason is that only in music were our slave forefathers allowed to retain and nurture anything of africa of blackness you see me being white and the slavemaster and all aint about to let you talk in no old tribal language naw no tellin what you might be gettin those black heads together on when l cant understand you so no storytelling no passing down traditions and all that youll learn this here language and the right stories outta this goodbook and the lies i got to tell you and enforce upon you sos i can sleep at night thats all and none of that foolin roun with your hands either you might call it sculpturing and painting but it looks like voodoo signs to me you gonna paint paint christ like michelangelo and them did you gonna make figures out of wood and stone then put some clothes on em and make em look more like me than they do sos can trust em but boy that rhythm you all got with them drums a nd oh those deep soulful voices want to go sing outside the bighouse and out in the fields while youre workingkeeps your mind occupied and it makes everything sound and look and feel so peaceful yes that is why the jazzman is the furthest along in selfassertion and unrestrained unaccommodating selfexpression because the slavemaster understood the danger in education but had never gotten to socrates warning about the songmakers so since music is the most abstract least concrete or plastic of the arts the jazzmaker never had to waste precious time proving how well he knew the language and forms of western man but went right ahead and bent that european scale to fit his own impulses had jazzmen been using words or readily definable images like our writers and painters then they too would be just now emerging in their true colors would have been squelched by editors publishers and critics for john coltrane is a man who through his saxophone before your eyes and ears completely annihilates every single western influence and longs and strains so totally so desperately for the asianafrican nuance that soon he is actually there in his playingas a man who calls on his gods and lo they appear this is the same thing as the afrohaircuts and clothes worn by people who have never been further east than bostona rejection and a yearning it may seem all a ridiculous joke to you but it is no less an effective and important joke than the one which was once recorded as law in this country that two indians and one africanor viceversa im not sureconstituted legally one human being yeh funny huh now getting back to the music there is another saxophonist named pharoah saunders who plays horrible lynchscenes with barking dogs and all coming out of his horn and thento my strange mind at leastgoes into the massacre of the resultant retaliation with the bleeding screams of men women and children when he finishes you dont know whether to applaud or go ask for an aspirin and a boatticket to somewhere else but it is truth as he has witnessed and visualizes it it is an artful projection there are other men like sonny rollins and ornette coleman who play so starkly freely personal that one knows that somehow they have felt nearly all the stimuli and hangups of this place and this time have gone into themselves somewhere and found new scales new harmoniesa new religion in fact now isnt that frighteningly interesting and what would it sound like in words appear as in definite symbols and images would it affect the selectiveservice draft do you think make for further boycotts and rejections with verbal jazzmen like leroi jones adding and explaining dimensions what will this yearning for the destruction of things western and the exulting of things eastern and this other personal insulation come to mean when it has all hit earth and settled i honestly do not know i only know that at least psychically there will be changes good changes it is as i eventually answered my friend black art can do a lot to topple white racist america if it is black enough what do i mean by black enough well let me try to give some examples of what i mean by black art or more specifically black literature i mean when a black writer really works inside that yearold sister sadie who has been a rock of her church for some thirty years and finds that she is a black nun loving and giving herself to herherjesus with a passion and a need that catholics only dream guiltily about that there are such things in that africanbaptist dance she does when the spirit hits her that are hardly imaginable to most people i mean when a writer looks into one of those housing projects and sees anna karenina or a madame bovarywith a different hue tone and manner of courseand just when the worldreader is panting for her and hoping that her plans work out the writer drops in the bigoted white cop of this black ghetto setting like a filthy stinkbomb and splatters the lovestory all to hell with a quick triggerfinger thats more like what blackness in this country is like life being stopped because its covering its skin is taboo i mean putting john henry on stage with his pride and hammers and wife family neighbors and have him go roaring against automation and the enslavement of the human spirit cussing fighting loving and hating all the way coming down hard on anybody and anything standing against his simple truth aw a man aint nothin but a man i mean a writer examining that crude but almost reflexive phrase the big mf and seeing in it matriarch feeding oedipus complex coming out of the emasculation of the black male and father image and the historic rape of the black woman and finding the way to explode that phrase into full meaning and consciousness i mean a writer sitting the late and great malcolm_x down with us and letting us hear the tobes and nottobes of a more modern and unique hamlet i mean seeing on paper how a black ghetto organizes politically and otherwise against the pressures of government police landlords and mafia the fictionist is free to project neverbeforeseen times places and circumstances hes the one whos supposed to be sitting up all night taking on and raking over the sins of this world is he not i mean a way of literarily stylizing that little bouncedip in the walks those creases and points in those hats i mean a literature knowing that since it deals with human beings the universals will fall no matter what if the readers lap is open so concerning itself with colloquials the little shades and nuances that come out of unique lifeexperiences and environmental influences a literature that asserts rather than reacts states rather than explains that is what i mean by black literature and when this literatureas did irish russian french and earlier american literaturefinally comes into being adding its weight to all the other force factors in the air there will be a change in the consciousness the selfsense of this country this people and something must topple must give way to the changes estifying and what j t a g shapes people your ii r mind our theatre will ita rm be a definitive act a ztiiris decisive song there will be portions of actual life unveiled all the things we could have been all the things we are all the things we will be there will be instruction there will be construction there will also be destruction really grinding all the faggoty frankensteins crapping their balls and eating them piecemeal before our very eyes forming our negative references detestable and detested check out leroi jones black mass his most accomplished play to date in my opinion jacoub a black magician in the pursuit of creation for creations sake a perversion like art for arts sake creates this monster the monster runs around like crazy vomiting and eating the vomit no one can communicate with it long before its only understandable sound me white reaches us we have identified this beast it has no regard for human life everything it touches undergoes a horrible distortion it touches tila a beautiful black woman who suddenly turns into a halfwhite monster hopping and slobbering around like this inhuman monster may you die a most horrible death if you claim you do not recognize this monster and its victims theatre as poetry be it comic or tragic be it instruction or entertainment remains an act which through language as complementary vehicleimage rhythm symbolcarves from life reveals and celebrates future direction it weaves past and present together to clarify future points of reference which exist now as desire or the artists imagination the language is necessarily complementary to the action to clarify some aspects of the experience psychic or physical so there will be very little dialogue because speech or words will come in only when other sounds or the action cannot clearly supply the necessary image the images and symbols will be national put up for clarification and illustration by the sharpedged sensibility of the artist whose impulse throbs with the nations desire and pulse the desired and desirable will be seen through elegant image and symbol abstracted from life the undesirable the corrupting the destructive will be portrayed in a grotesque manner its sinister qualities driving us to the mercy killing of the villain dont get me wrong this will not be life in its entirety it will be portions of life because art is not life art is contained in life life is the bigger body from which art cuts out bleeding portions for illustration revelation celebration and whatever moves the capable sensibility leaping from the corner where a spade is a spade yes we will finally be coming to grips with where we are really at historically we will be destroying the symbols which have facilitated our captivity we will be creating and establishing symbols to facilitate our necessary constant beginning old decadent wouldbe black woman this theatre will straighten out your mind instead of your hair if you are too twisted andor petrified to be straightened out it will pulp you to death your hideous little imitation life pungent like the stench of stale menstrual flow it will be a cleaning up for a theatre life portions of sheer beauty paths towards a life of construction after the necessary destruction how do you relate to that stupid powdery mask you wear every morning or all that junk in your toilet i understand now they even wear blonde wigs in south africa are you some imitation caucasian bitch have mercy on the male counterpart selling black for a quick screw as welton smith so clearly points out the villains in the theatre as in real life will be alienated and destroyed fearridden noball cowards drowned in their own filth forced to yield place to a better order of things we want to love and laugh unrestrained for this nowlost simple natural right our new heroes will giantwalk and destroy any and everything that attempts to militate against that desire as indeed we have to do in real life all the antilife crap that must vacate our minds will go up in flames jehovah jc capitalism hollywood art for arts sake the whole jive all points of reference will emerge from within the nation so will our heroes literary and nationaldedan kimathi malcolm du bois nkrumah nyerere babu toure fanon and many more living and being born every day pulsating with visions of a world worth killing and dying for the european game will be over in the arts as in our real life for a long time this theatre will not be liked because it will make many people uncomfortable because it will be a portrayal of truth because we have been trained in western freak institutions to be afraid of truth is it then surprising that confrontation with truth unveiled is not always particularly pleasant again like jones sings these are natural things no one is threatening anybody thats just the way life is my play wedding band is the story of a black woman and a white man south carolinians who in the year desire to become legally married it was then and m tnc is now against the state law for two such citizens to be joined in matrimony the drama also concerns two black warriors serving in world war i known as the war to end all wars with the assurance that after the battle patriotism would be rewarded with firstclass citizenship it is now three wars later and the promise made is still unkept other characters include three black women struggling in various ways to survive without the protection of their men two white women in conflict with each other and the contradictions of society a poor white salesman comically lost in the confused labyrinth of his own mind and a negro servant who earns a lonely but wellfed existence by deliberately turning away from the problems of progress against this tragicomic background two little girls one white the other colored are deeply impressed by the unfolding of events people tend to ask why write about thatthat usually stands for the possibility of controversy which has a way of stemming from themes on race or interracial conflict when presented in a land which abounds in racist law and racism but no matter how much has been seen and heard about that little of it has come from the american writer of african descent only of his plays have reached broadway in the last years only two were made into filmsa raisin in the sun by lorraine hansberry and purlie victorious by ossie davis it seems evident that theatre audiences have not been exposed to a great deal of controversial or any other kinddrama created by the afroamerican playwright sixteen plays over such a period of time constitute a very small percentage of the thousands presented on the big street in the art center of the u s a new york city n y much more work has seen the light of day on the stages of offbroadway and in community theatres improvised in churches libraries and meeting halls these productions have reached only a small section of the public and as a result we hear little if anything about themexcept from those scholars who devote time and energy to researching the subject playwright and guggenheim fellow loften mitchells new book black drama which comes from the press this spring promises to shed more light on a comparatively unexplored subject our dramatists have not had a wider viewing because we as a people have not had the power to decisively determine the quality and quantity of our participation in theater television radio and films which power would enable us to portray life as we see it also those who have the power and the means of production seem at best constrained to move slowly and to keep pace with the advances or setbacks of the national struggle for human and civil_rights the characters in a play may be made of impressions gathered from old or new incidents conversations disconnected words and sensememories of physical characteristics and human emotions they are created and constructed of what hurts and what heals slowly built and put in order out of the conflict which comes from the daily search for bread love and a place in the sun the best characters are good and true cowardly and brave miserable and happy filled with the virtues and weaknesses found in ourselves they grow stronger and more insistent in the mind of the writer they cancel each other out until the right story and the right people emerge and blend into one predominant idea or theme the story of wedding band gradually took shape as the result of a reaction to hearing that old chestnut quoted time and time t againthe two freeest things in the country are the black woman and the white man the more it was repeated the more often i wondered what kind of freedom the originator of the remark had m in mind it is a known fact that in cer tain states in the union the black woman in and out of bondage was free with or without her consent and to the detriment of her children to have her body exploited as unpaid and cheap labor andor illegal sex in these same states the white man was free to use her wrongly for these purposes but not free to offer her or their offspring the protection of his name and property segregationists constantly proclaim that we cannot legislate in order to force citizens toward equal rights and better race relations but they have passed thousands of laws to force us in the opposite direction it seems that such reasoning should have resulted in no race creed or color laws at all which would leave people free to think for themselves after writing a first draft of the play i spent considerable time in libraries researching the racist laws found in the united states it would have been easy to spend a few years or even a lifetime at this endeavor so i had to call a halt and go back to the job of writing anyone interested in the subject will save time by reading the very excellent book titled states laws on race and color compiled and edited by attorney pauli murray published by the womens division of christian service of the methodist church it is interesting to know that after emancipation the state of georgia declared every colored child born before march shall be the legitimate child of his mother this action clearly prevented the black mother from claiming any inheritance for her children born of a slavemaster father the harm done by such a law was compounded by the attitude of selfdepreciation and selfhatred it sometimes engendered in the black communities most racemixing had taken place under the sanction of the slave institution but in the interest of selfpreservation the penniless black now technically out of bondage was forced to keep quiet concerning his relationship to white families his race was now lightened to various shadings and newly labeled colored on documents rest room doors drinking water fountains and railroad station waiting rooms even the statistics of today very much concerned with counting how many heads are on welfare credit the entire mixed population to the black people we see no calculation as to the number of such persons who represent the disinherited those bilked of any portion of what was rightfully theirs due to the legal exploitation of black women the few whites who wished to acknowledge their mixed families were by law forbidden to do so some passed for colored and were married in the south but upon the death of such a person his relatives were able to disprove the marriage and seize all the worldly goods of any material value even today in this matter we frequently allow ourselves to be placed on the defensive why talk about thatl if we criticized the law theyll think we want to be with them if we criticized segregation at all theyll think were avidly seeking their company it is certainly evident that the black american has had nothing to do with the creation or implementation of such devious legal trickery as racist law but put on the defensive it somehow seems to many of us that a challenge to what has been set up to regiment and regulate our lives places us in danger of being judged by the oppressor and ourselves and found wanting in dignity and integrity under the sanctimonious cover of states rights some citizens have been able to plan the future of others without their participation separate but equal law has had more than a hundred years to further impoverish the black communities wedding band examines womans position in society her situation at this very moment the story is set in and reveals through the people of that time how few of the wrongs which threaten family unity have been righted in order to deal with the subject a writer must find his way through a maze of confusion and clear away the warped thinking caused by slavery and its after effects the acid poisons of selfhatred and contempt caused by the miseducation of the people in order to deal effectively with the problems created by marriage laws it was necessary to make sure that the play not be interpreted as one which advocates the intermarriage of races that kind of treatment would place the work almost in the same camp as the antipeople legislation therefore no character could plead the cause of intermarriage and none suggest the changing of law the other hurdle to overcome was the shadow cast by all the stories that have been told about the mintjulep colonel and his almostwhite sweetheart for my leads i selected a black seamstress and a white baker and projected them into a situation in which there was no premeditated intention of exploitation on either side and only the events that take place in their lives during the crisis of an influenza epidemic were used in shaping the progress of the play also because some of us hope to be assimilated absorbed and digested into the mainstream of american life thus proving that we in and of ourselves are not american life it was necessary for my story to have a black woman who did not seek this kind of solution in her personal act of integration where did such a woman meet a white man on at least an almost equal footing the obvious place to find an unprotected young woman living away from family and friends is in domestic service on the kind of sleepin job which allows a monthly or bimonthly visit home the closest white equal in this case might be an unmarried tradesman operating a oneman business in this way the seamstress and baker were set up to meet and unfold the story the most crucial three days in the relationship take place years after their first meeting and so the entire action is accomplished during this threeday period the missing factor in the interracial tales usually found in fiction is the black man the colonels sweetheart never seemed to know any men of her own race and those presented as background filler were usually slackkneed objects of pity this caused me to see an admirable black man in the center of the drama one who could supply a counterpoint story with its own importance a man whose every day existence is threatened with the possibility of a life and death struggle after the first or second draft of the script there comes a time when all the earmarks of preachment must be searched out and removed all that has been superimposed by the writer all that the characters deny and refuse to accept anything that smacks of pamphleteering on the subject out come some of your favorite bits and piecesthe idiom of speech never used by those characters who people your work you are taxed to show them as they are beautiful in a way not yet merchandised by madison avenue one day the federal government must declare that no state may carry any law which infringes upon the federal rights of any citizen such action will lift the struggle for human and civil_rights to the position where the people may move forward with the unstinting approval of their government between that time and this we who find ourselves born into this past and present situation will continue to protest in various ways according to our understanding and circumstances those conscious of living in the blight of legalized limitation will continue to be engrossed in the controversy of to be or not to be free the american of african descent has produced the only new music which came out of the new worldspirituals gospel and jazz i firmly believe that for him the protest play will reach new heights in form and content become ever more finished in craftsmanship and eventually prove to be the most varied and original theatre on the american scene the times dictate the trend we are at a moment in history when the playwright cannot turn away from social drama without abandoning the search for truth in a conference monday may th in ann arbor david rambeau director of the concepteast theatre was told by university officials that the lilywhite association of producing artists was an artistic ideal mr rambeau met with university vicepresident heyns assistant to the vicepresident miller professor schnitzer executive director of the apa and professor sattler chairman of the speech department when these officials were questioned about other areas of the professional theater program over the past two years these details were revealed in the new play project and the professional fellowship program scholarships per year no negroes were utilized in the play of the month series one negro actress in two years when it was pointed out to vicepresident heyns that one negro in two years in all four areas the apa play of the month series new play project and the professional fellowship program indicated reasonable evidence of the absence of equal opportunity mr heyns instructed mr rambeau that the situation could remain so for ten years and still be no indication of discrimination or unequal opportunity during the discussion mr rambeau attempted to introduce the comments of frederick oneal negro actors leader looks at the record detroit news recently elected president of actors equity who cited the patterns of discrimination in the theater however none of the university officials would even so much as peruse the editorial to ascertain whether the comments might possibly be applied to the situation at the university of michigan professor schnitzer flatly stated there is no prejudice in the theater when questioned as to whether any negroes had ever been with the apa the university officials stated that that information was not available when queried as to what evidence would indicate discrimination mr rambeau was summarily told by professor schnitzer that he and mr rabb casting director were not prejudiced if there were no negroes in the apa it was merely because none had applied for auditions or that if any had applied none was qualified vicepresident heyns accepted this statement as gospel and indicated that though the university had hired the apa it could not question the segregated casting policy as this would be an infringement on artistic freedom when mr rambeau pointed out to vicepresident heyns that the play of the month series was bringing to the campus segregated shows from broadway and that the university should not buy such productions he was told to go talk to the producers of the shows or produce concrete evidence and not statistics rambeau pointed out that this kind of evidence statistics was the only kind readily available to the outsider and that this is what civil_rights organizations and the president s committee on equal opportunity used in their investigations mr rambeau was asked what made him think these methods possessed any adequacy in this situation when mr rambeau suggested that one way to correct the situation would be to add some qualified negroes to the apa he was called a racist as the meeting wore on it became quite obvious that the university officials would do nothing on their own to correct the situation as they view the entire professional theater program as quite satisfactory still mr rambeau pressed question after question and point after point for nearly two hours in hopes of enlightening the university officials to the discriminatory setup existing in their theater he cited the concepts of cultural exclusion in the professional theater racial casting historical and current discrimination in movies television and the stage de facto segregation in the high school systems that feed the university drama program the selffulfilling prophecy in imprinting on potential negro applicants that they have no opportunity or place in white plays and the social and psychological community repercussions of segregated educational programsall to no avail when continued inquiry about university image educational idealism leadership and community obligation proved redundant mr rambeau concluded that further investigation by other concerned parties would have to be secured on this dissonant note the conference was terminated there exists an ironic postscript worthy of mention at neighboring michigan state university on may and was held a symposium on school integration which had two purposes first to focus attention on school segregation issues particularly in the north and west and second to contribute to the solutions of the problems through conversations between social scientists professional educators and local educational policy makers in obvious consequence of the may conference on discrimination in the professional theater program at the university of michigan the association of producing artists held a spade day audition in nyc concepteast officials were informed by their new york associates that the apa sent out a casting call to actors agents to which nearly negro actors and actresses responded to fill a single vacancy as the waiting rooms filled the applicants recognized the blatantly segregated scene and showered apa representatives with derision subsequent to the audition form letters were sent to the unqualified applicants informing them that they had failed to meet apa standards in a stealthy plot to avoid rigorous negotiation of differences the apa failed to inform the concepteast of their decision to open the theater company to token integration officials of concepteast viewed this as another subtle attempt of the power structure to foist a unilateral decision on the negro as to his needs and the limit of his opportunity this endplay by the apa in their new york audition is just another insult to the two years of injury which the negro endured from the universitys lilywhite professional theater program which was termed by its executive director as an artistic ideal in view of this naive maneuver the concepteast set its minimum terms for bringing a reasonable degree of equal opportunity into the university program as follows employment of six qualified negro actors for the coming season a public statement of nonracial casting awarding of two of the seven fellowships in the professional fellowship program to negro colleges that all broadway or offbroadway shows brought to the university in the play of the month series be integrated that this years new play in the new play project be authored by a negro concepteast termed its request reasonable in view of the two years of public and private bigotry during the residence at the university of the apa if these minimum requests are met the apa can maintain its private prejudices behind a mask of liberal equal opportunity as behavior rather than attitude is crucial to the concepteast in the face of obtrusive hypocrisy as evidenced by the situation in the universitys professional theater program one can easily understand the invectiveridden nature of plays authored by negroes who evaluate their american dream james baldwins blues for mr charlie and leroi jones dutchman belch the grim need for recognition in the us the concepteast has had its broiled eyes focused on the apa for two solid years watching the scene develop while silently singing the blues now its time for blues for mr charlie on august david rambeau director of the concepteast theatre filed a complaint with the michigan civil_rights commission charging the university of michigan and the association of producing artists with complicity in discriminatory practices in employment and education in the operation of their professional theater program on september milton brown field representative of the mcrc met with university attorneys university vicepresident heyns assistant to the vice president miller and executive director of the apa schnitzer in this preliminary investigation data was sought on the alleged discriminatory practices prior to the initiation of a formal suit because of the interstate nature of the case concepteast theatre officials have asked the actors equity association and the new york state commission for human rights to investigate the new york operations of the association of producing artists and submit advisory opinions when questioned about the apa mr rambeau stated this acting company might as well have come from mississippi for all the equ opportunity it is supposed to have its hiring practices are not unlike those of the apprentice trades and everybody knows that situation besides michigan has enough problems without importing some of new yorks if the apa is characteristic of the hiring policies in new york theres little wonder that there are riots in harlem and brooklyn during a continued discussion of the complaint mr rambeaus views were enlarged and detailed the apa and the university of michigan constitute just one phase of a total system of economic and educational discrimination existing in the united states against the negro if there is any initial problem in prosecuting the complaint it will be in identifying their the university and apa specific roles and discriminatory actions in the broad pattern of racial prejudice this pattern of economic discrimination is recurrent in every area of the dramatic arts films television radio and the legitimate stage as educational discrimination is evidenced by de facto segregation in the schools elementary and high schools overcrowded classes slanted texts and biased school administrators the end results are theatre companies like the apa and freshman classes at the university of michigan wherein negroes were found enrolled in the class of over then we witness frantic corrective measures apas spade day audition in new york this summer and token hiring of a negro to sit by the door so that if and when investigators come they can trot out their kept nigger and say look look oh no were liberal and legal for government contracts weve got one of them and corrective measures like the universitys scholarships for the culturally deprived approximately scholarships so that now the freshman class will have slightly less than three per cent negro enrollment rather than slightly less than one per cent this paltry progress is designed to be balm for the white educated liberals conscience his egoistic realization of noblesse oblige and christian charity this paltry progress is designed to placate black moderates and castrate black militants all such stopgap measures are ultimately unsatisfactory because the bigoted immoral premises on which they are based are ultimately untenable for both the victim and the oppressor we now witness the internationally esteemed university of michigan its attorneys and vice presidents defending a corrupt situation the professional theatre program in a corrupt system economic and educational strangulation based on corrupt values racial discrimination perhaps the time has p y come to assess those characteristics which skcwssi make the new york shakespeare festival an important american classical theatre even though the festival has achieved recognition primarily on artistic grounds there are nevertheless certain problems inherent in the interracial structure of the company which take on importance beyond the basic consideration of professional abilities our attention in this article will be directed towards these social problems which have developed from the racial composition of the festival organization because of its role as the popular theatre for everyone the festival has a critical responsibility to the multiracial community which supports its program this obligation has been fulfilled only within recent years through a balanced company representing the various ethnic groups present in new york city joseph papp the festival producer seems to be making an honest effort in this direction he stated in an interview on april a major objective of the festival we would like to have a company that is representative of all the various facets of the population of new york city all the various minorities and we want this not for sociological reasons but for artistic reasons in comparison to other repertory companies such as the arena theatre in washington d c the lincoln center repertory company in new york city and the american conservatory theatre in san francisco the attempt is impressive a closer look at the problems created by the integrated aspects of the company is perhaps best observed through an analysis of coriolanus as directed by gladys vaughan in this particular play dramatizes the inner struggles of a roman aristocrat caius marcius coriolanus a man unable to overcome the inadequacies of his moral and ethnical principles through his actions we are able to see the larger conflicts existing between peasant and aristocrat in this legendary history of romes emergence as a world power this is one of shakespeares most difficult plays and is subject to a great number of interpretations mrs vaughan saw many parallels between this classic play and our society and felt that the mob would be more meaningful to this period if the cast were mixed the concluding lines in the program notes of the production elaborate upon this viewpoint since the future of the entire human race is now vulnerable to that moment of decision of the man in power a study of those who seek power is more pertinent than ever before the transposition of dramatic theme to a contemporary context introduced certain emotional tensions which reflected the present struggle of negroes for firstclass citizenship that which resulted on stage was more of a civil_rights demonstration than a play some anachronism is of course part of the contemporary form but even then it must be controlled in order not to distort the authors intentions the effects of such a narrow interpretation was obviously not foreseen there is a social comment implied in the theme of the play and the pattern of the action however it is not the responsibility of a director or actor to impose a preconceived idea upon a play or an audience a spectator can also limit and destroy an art experience by imposing predetermined expectations and terms of social reference upon a play and upon performers who exist momentarily within the world of the play one should be forced to think and draw his own conclusions through the artistic power of the drama rather than from predetermined valuejudgment we expect the playwright to provide us with experience which is more dynamic more objective and more coherent than the contradictions present in actual experience by the same token it is the responsibility of the artist to interpret this ordered experience by trying to find the authors intention and to transmit the same meaning to an audience without distortionthe dramatic focus and aesthetic quality of this particular production was vague and unclear in the first place the performance was too long additional editing of the script would have eliminated much that was unnecessary to the progression of the plot one critic remarked that the director had seen fit to put so many members of equity to work that the stage gets cluttered and the battle scenes look more like street rumbles than actual war it was obvious that the continual movement of citizens running on and off stage shouting waving flags and scrambling about resulted in action that was often unintentionally comical there were moments however when the crowd was a determined and suffering mob with the exception of jane white who played volumnia and james earl jones as the tribune junius brutus the remaining negro actors made up the majority of the tattered dirty mob john simon in his usual blunt manner observed with mrs vaughans roman citizenry about fourfifths negro rome became clearly the capital of abyssinia the few whites presumably accountable for as missionaries the trouble with this sort of thing is that it cannot help setting off wrong responses one such response occurred when the segregationist coriolanus mounted the platform and told the roman peasants i banish you the middleclass white audience in the delacorte theatre applauded it was obvious that they sided with the white element in what appeared to be a modern civilrights fight there was a great deal of action on the stage but it had little to do with an objective study of a democratic society in which neither side is totally right or completely wrong the director informed this writer that her choice of cast depended primarily upon the talents of the actors and the demands of the roles she further attempted to justify the use of so many negroes by stating this could have been historically accurate even in roman days so it wasnt historically inaccurate to cast negroes and we had several other ethnic groups represented this idea perhaps deserves praise from a social viewpoint but it did not serve the play as written what the audience observed was a group of actors in many situations which paralleled rather than expressed the play also the approach of a few actors in their roles merely emphasized the fact that they were negro their colloquial patterns of speech physical movements and facial gestures leads one to feel that they either lacked understanding of or disregard for the characters that were portrayed the arrangement of white to negro performers brought a different nuance to the script and quite possibly eliminated the play as it was originally conceived when various dramatic themes are interpreted to emphasize certain problems in american society especially with the addition of nonwhite cast membersthe plays take on an immediate importance dr esther jackson former director of education of the new york shakespeare festival may have discovered the solution to this serious problem which exists not only within the festival organization but within the american theatre at large i think the development of a multiracial ethic and a multiracial aesthetic on the stage are dependent upon helping artiststhat is the producers and directorsto free themselves subconsciously perhaps of very deep prejudices which make it necessary for them to use negro players in nonartistic ways no inference is being made that this is the basis of the problem as observed in coriolanus in this instance the director had some difficulty in maintaining the dominant idea among acting staging and designinghallmarks of a skilled director norman nadel felt that dramatic integration was lacking the integration so vital is the intimate relationship of one role to another and all to the play gladys vaughan accepted the risk of failure by approaching the text of legendary history from a contemporary viewpoint certainly the same risk is present in a conventional production if the results are dull and unimaginative whether she consciously considered coriolanus as a medium of social propaganda or only happened upon this idea is not the primary reason that her production was not completely successful there appeared to have been no coherent realization of theme reflected through the particular shape of the play and the artistic use of nonwhite actors within the play the emphasis of production focused on visual elements such as a wellmounted stage sumptuous costumes physically attractive actors exciting and realistic sound effects and movement patterns of choreographic dimension in the last analysis theatre is either good or bad it either succeeds in creating a meaningful experience or it fails in spite of the social ideas practiced by an individual or an organization since coriolanus is based on legendary history it is not totally symbolic the idea that integrated casting may possibly work better in plays that are nonovertly historical symbolic or poetic should be considered by mrs vaughan it could be that this play was a bad choice or perhaps less sophistication is necessary to recognize the universality of the human condition the problems that face the actors in the festival company are in many ways typical of those faced by the average american actor without a tradition of discipline and training in classical styles of acting the quality of production cannot help but be inferior in excellence one major cause is the absence of a pattern of continuity which a strong training program will provide not only for the actors but for the artistic and technical staff as well although casting procedures have been unbiased they nonetheless reflect gross indiscrimination a quantitative approach has resulted in a company which employs many unqualified actors from both races it is significant perhaps that the festival often prefers to use lightskinned negroes like frank silvera jane white or ellen holly in major roles there have been exceptions like robert hooks james earl jones and roscoe lee browne however the limitation of certain types of negroes to a variety of nonheroic lead roles has been naive in spite of the preceding criticism the festival has made a unique contribution to the american theatre its innovating spirit and earnestness in taking classical drama presenting it with some style and taste and yet making it practical enough to be enjoyed by a large crosssection of people from all levels of society is significant also the festival directors have shown a large degree of integrity in an effort to measure up to high artistic goals which they have set for themselves and for the people of new york city in the midst of bureaucratic disinterest these at tempts are praiseworthy even though theory and practice are not completely harmonious at this time during the last few years the festival has earnestly worked towards integrated theatre in keeping with the peculiar makeup of our society this type of theatre offers the healthiest and most rewarding type of art experience to the greatest number of people but if the vitality and creativity of the negro actor is going to be reduced through integrated theatre then an allnegro theatre would probably be better actually what is needed for the total acceptance of a multiracial aesthetic is the broad exposure of society to integrated art activities the negro artist in many instances has much to offer the american theatre and an interracial theatre is perhaps where his greater contribution will be made theater for social welfare has replaced theatres old image an image of pastime activity the federal government is subsidizing many of the countrys repertory theaters however no black theaters and the present funded repertory theaters are not involving talents from the black communities there should be an involvement of the black communities in this new awareness of the power of the theaters because the social condition of this country is directly related to conditions in the black communities to say that barefoot in the park and hello dolly represent theater is in a sense like saying black communities do not exist it is a paradox to expect that nonexistent community to come downtown to broadway or to the tyrone guthrie theatre in minneapolis and pay to support what has no relation at all to what the members of that community know as this society item witness the odd couple any wednesday l do i do mame art for profit or a play by jean kerr has never been a password from black talents they are not that far removed from the lifeline but it is not the black talents who are funded or even encouraged to be a part of the federally supported repertory theaters the repertory companies are encouraged by the boards of education and the poverty programs to perform in the school systems and b fore the culturally deprived yet the plays and the artist are far removed from the lifeline of the black communities in new york and california there are cultural programs operating under the antipoverty program these drama and dance companies could easily operate in conjunction with the board of education to bring socially meaningful art to schools in the immediate area it seems to me that a theater for the social welfare of a community should provide opportunities for talented blacks in the communities to develop as artists within a professional setting at the same time this could demonstrate the need for communitybased repertory both talent and theater would be making a collective contribution to the community this is not happening the artists who are supported create from a safe distance therefore their work is synthetic its description of this society its attempt to make order out of chaos has no lasting value how can an artist depict a black art say of watts mississippi or harlem when that artist is living comfortably in westport or hollywood item the federal government under title and title is supporting stuart vaughns new orleans repertory theatre no negroes are involvedneither in background or foreground it has been proven that a black audience does exist for a socially meaningful theater blacks came out to support baldwins blues for mister charlie and amen corner they supported hansberrys a raisin in the sun leroi jones black arts repertory and his oneact plays the toilet the slave and dutchman now they are flocking to douglas turner wards happy ending and day of absence these plays could easily belong to a black federally supported repertory theater in a black community for integration a black hamlet genets the blacks or dubermans in white america otherwise black talent will continue to wait for white approval on projects that are watered rewritten andor rejected labeled protest oppressed people and classes have historically channeled their images and passions to the stage beaumarchais marriage of figaro kindled social fires that helped flame the french revolution gorkys the lower depths in dramatized the oppression of russias peasants clifford odets during the thirties stung the social conscience with his prolabor play waiting for lefty item art must deal with the time my students here at mobilization for youth were so moved by waiting for lefty that they adapted it from the original cab strike to a rent strike on new yorks lower east side something meaningful for them there must be some reason for not showing the young and the deprived what the theater is capable of doing could it be fear there must be a change in the identity of those who bring art into the black communities if blacks are to have quality education and participation in the various art forms including theater even now the lincoln center repertory company is taking live theater into the new york school system and to the culturally deprived while it is effective in the schools which are basically middle class it is less effective in the schools say in harlem and bedford stuyvesant this is because whites believe that blacks are still trying to assimilate it is the exact reverse on the ascendant now is a tremendous pride in being black whites ignorance of this is causing ineffectual education and of course the promotion of subject matter that is boring to the children in these areas in the theater of the sixties black consciousness has reached new levels of concentration and intensity a metaphysical play by beckett with negro and puerto rican performers would be more effective than shakespeare with an allwhite cast this is due to an immediate identification with the visual image of the present item in harlem roger furman operating with oeo office of economic opportunity funds as a part of haryou has consistently exhibited fine theatre his productions with the young vital performer would be an inspiration for every junior high school student in the ghetto after reading the reports from ford foundation in the s and the rockefeller foundation one can hardly find reasons for them not dumping grants into these socially deprived communities the foundations state their policies which do not hold generally for black communities example the foundation should exercise discrimination and selectivity and give its funds largely for significant activity not likely to be supported by others they should seek out sustain and amplify excellence and where necessary create new centers of excellence they should help to increase the vigor of private institutions and private initiative in areas of critical concern to society there are some regional theaters in the united states supported by foundations and now the federal government under the national endowment of the arts and titles and under the elementary and secondary education act these theaters do not include blacks on staff as designers directors writers or technicians black actors are booked in as spear carriers in the old classics nothing is realistic in these regional theaters for the black artist nothing is realistic for black audiences now the federal government is helping to support this discriminating system it started in the middle fifties after the mccarthy senate investigations pop art emerged because the artist could say it meant a when it really meant b or vice versa art as well as the theater went abstract for safetyhappenings theatre of the absurd etc it became a lie artists knew this the public knew it it could not last black artists emerged from the chaos because they had less to lose white america went deeper into it by trying to escape via musicals comedies british angry young men and because the country was afraid it laughed and danced trying to forget the lie the social welfare of this country is at stake white america trying to escape from the inner city to the suburb is synonymous to whites trying to escape from what we all know can exist order in the chaos under all that singing and dancing on broadway there is a lifeline vietnam mississippi harlem watts malcolm_x theater is no longer a pastime it is serious business it can be dangerous and yet we know that black communities must have their own art centers because white values are not black values in the thirties when roosevelts workmans progress administration wpa supported the theater blacks were involved because the theater put money in circulation blacks didnt control it as many believe it was on the whole meaningful even though in the eyes of roosevelts administration it was pastime activity high class theater for social welfare was disguised as pastime activity until the establishment witnessed performances of the cradle will rock it cant happen here one third of the nation but now during the sixties theater for pastime activity cannot be disguised as theater for social welfare when we read that stuart vaughns new orleans repertory theater is doing charleys aunt we chuckle and say whitey is doing it again two things happen when a play about blacks is presented for whites anytime a play is presented on broadway or offbroadway it is presented for whites they stay away because they are not interested in the least in what blacks are saying because most of the time blacks are saying some truths about the conditions in this country or whites are so conditioned by musicals and comedies and historical museum pieces that they are not prepared to witness anything new for example consider the recent play whos got his own by ronald milner at the american place theatre harold clurman theater critic for the nation departed after act i and did not review the play now i must point out here that whos got his own is a black play american place theatre is a white theaterwith a good reputation its subscription audience is per cent white and through studies it has been proven that subscription audiences are middle class harold qurman is a critic for a national magazine he is as middle class as the audience for that play his dismissal of whos got his own reflects the feelings of that audience milner received a firstclass production of his play and a secondclass audience to approve its worth the wirter was caught in the paradoxical situation with which most black artists in this country are eventually faced to be an american artist and at the same time to be a negro to please the audience the author and the theater would have had to lie about the black mans condition in this country the artists function is to interpret life says john o killens i see him as a hunter in the jungle with civilization being the jungle his prey is truth socially meaningful theater must be truthful to the happenings of our time hat is the free southw ern theater followjj ing are some general and informal facts on its rounding and funding its projects and its prospects plus some comments on both the nature ofand the need for black community theater in february five members of the fst company appeared in a reading of afroamerican poetry at rochdale village queens new york after the show the company held a discussion with the audience as is its usual practice a woman questioner asked the company what sort of reaction do you get that is from southern audiences who have no orientation in theater your presentation seems very sophisticated the fst is in its third year began its fifth season on april with a converted flooded out supermarket as its theater in the desire project area of new orleans the fst hires a staff of approximately ten actors technicians and managers in january the fst advertised in the actors trade journals in new york for applicants who would like to be considered for the season almost white applicants mailed in resumes and photographs in laurel mississippi the company is performing gilbert moses original play roots about the illusions of an aging afroamerican mississippi couple the stage is on home plate at the laurel baseball stadium colored division there are no seats the audience stands from the pitchers mound backentering the theater from either third base first base or center field at one point in the script roscoe orman playing the old man is to attempt to open a jar but cant he struggles with the jar an old mississippi man wanders onto the stage from the crowd kindly assists roscoe returns to the audience the fst is appearing in sale hall morehouse college atlanta georgiahome of the cream of negro education the company presents its poetry show first half afroamerican second half afro it is a bitter and proud show designed to expose realities and foster reeducation afterwards during the discussion a young drama major says it has no plot you cant do drama that way drama must have plot and development the arrangement of the actors on stage was unbalanced there was more strength on the right than on the left this violates one of the first axioms of staging sam hill is reading his new play in the writers workshop in new orleans sam hill is a yearold high school junior who has written four plays and performed in two fst productions the company pays him a week the fst is his summer job the door is open sunlight and kids noise float in sams play is about a young husband who rebels against his staid young wife by debasing her with the wild lascivious animal sounds of a jazz record juno who is awaiting trial on some incredible charge or other wanders in juno listens to sams play when sam finishes juno says man you crazy wanders out a nigerian student who has studied at the university of illinois and has been with the fst three weeks is packing to return to illinois the company is very sad the nigerian said it is simply too hot it never gets this hot in nigeria we make a note to apply for an airconditioning grant from ritzy new york foundation in midday our building in new orleans is over degrees we own two small floor fans in the fst literature workshop there is one clear favorite the autobiography of malcolm_x the company receives a registered letter it is from a spokesman for the housing authority of new orleans the spokesman takes exception to the essay on the desire project in our poetry show which had been filmed in june for national presentation by cbstv our piece strikingly delivered by actress denise nicholas had told of lack of facilities for black people in the desire project it warned that if corrective action was not taken by the city or if black people in desire did not organize to force corrective action then new orleans could expect the same rioting which was exploding in other cities the tv show was filmed in our theater in desirea filmed discussion followed our audience the folk of the area heatedly discussed the whys and wherefores of their community the letter from the housing authority termed our presentation calculated to engender racial disharmony it went on to state if there were evidence of wilful neglect of chronic mistreatment of callousness in any other form on the part of the authority leading to the conclusion that the thousands of residents of the desire project are in effect abandoned in spite of all reasonable efforts to arouse the authority to a full sense of responsibility then and only then could we look without too much suspicion and distrust upon what we must consider an infamous indictment the letter suggested a meeting between the fst board of directors and the housing authority naming time and place we were to be requested to ask that the tv show be canceled the fst board which is very small and includes several company members declined to meet with the housing authority as far as we were concerned there was nothing to negotiate the housing authority of new orleans appealed to the national council of churches which sponsored the show without satisfaction the show appeared as scheduled august except in new orleans which blacked it out the company is returning from the last mississippi tour late in september fst owns three vehicles a weatherbeaten blue station wagon held together by rope on loan from sncc a weatherbeaten black station wagon given fst by photographer gordon parks and a truckvan which the company purchased about miles from new orleans the black beetle coughs sputters and dies the company leaves it to be repaired and pile into the blue beetle outside new orleans the blue beetle coughs sputters and dies push shove and strain into the truckvan it is august in bogalusa la it is dull in when the company appeared in bogalusa the black community was in the midst of a massive fight for its rightsdemonstrators were ubiquitous violence was in the air there were scores of visiting workers from core and other organizations in the company had played to an overflow audience it seemed as if the entire black community came the bogalusa chief of police had brought his men to observe outside the union hall the company had entered and left bogalusa under armed escort by the deacons for defense now all the visiting rights workers have retired to their own bags the only remaining workers are the bogalusa voters league led by robert hicks and a z young since bogalusa is only miles from new orleans we had decided to take several workshop kids to the show dick schechner tulane drama review editor who had been influential in the move of fst to new orleans in drove another car it was very dull we shot pool in the afternoon the summer was coming to an end without the kind of harassing arrests and incipient violence that accompanied the tour after the show we who were returning to new orleans the company was remaining in bogalusa to play the next night requested deacon escort for a few miles as a precautionary routine we were asked to wait for the escort in a local cafe after about an hour the deacons still had not appeared then charles sims their leader burst in he said there had been a shooting in another section of town there might be danger we would have to wait a while longer nothing to worry about he assured us mr young came in rushed to a telephone there was buzzing outside hurried anxious conversations weapons were visible the athlete of our workshop group said just get me to lake ponchartrain bordering new orleans and ill run the rest of the way mile bridge we sat around gloomily waiting finallysims returned said lets go lead driver follow meturn it on one of our cars will trail bogalusa stinksfrom the paper millbut if you can forget that the highway to new orleans is a lovely green shadowed drive at night the shadows hang like ghosts the highway from bogalusa is the loveliest in louisiana we sped out about am on to lake ponchartrain and new orleans black country theater usa the free southern theater is now evolving toward a black community theater this course has been determined as much by the experiences of the fst during its three years in the south as the theoretical beliefs of the company of course black community theater is one of those terms like black_power which can mean different things to different people lets take a step backward and look at fst properly within the broader perspective of the black artist in america not only does the black artist work in a society basically hostile to the aspirations of his people but he has little audience among his own people especially the writer and actor we tend to forget that literature and theater are first mediums albeit highly sophisticated of communication and the art of drama and literature is always extremely influenced by the attitudes and values of the audience we take this principle for granted but it has a special meaning for the black american writer for the black american writer writing for a primarily white audience usually imposes a serious limitation on the choice of approaches to his material we could reduce these approaches to two far too monoleveled bags neatly bound either the writer satisfies the demands and assumptions of the white audience or he as several are now successfully doing attacks the assumptions of the white audience with a hostility that at least satisfies the need to reject a society built on racial and other hypocrisies for the black actor performing in theaters owned controlled and supported by the white establishment means performing in a commercial atmosphere totally divorced from the culture which produced him and almost always becoming involved in a vehicle which must make money from white theatergoers to survive and even these jobs are very rare only a theater which plays for and to the black community can alter this situation thus open up new possibilities for black writers absolutely essential contact between the writer and the people he is writing about is reestab w lished thus the fundamental communication between artist and audience becomes possible such a theater offering the multiplicity of disciplines unique to theater can provide a conduit for the exploration of new themes and patterns which have really never been explored by our writers because this particular relationship between writer and audience has always been absent and if such a theater is even moderately financially successful it means jobs for black actors under conditions conducive to the development of an art not merely a commerce experience with the fst which has been playing to per cent black audiences affirms the necessity for a theater so integrated into the issues and immediacies of the communitv that it becomes func tional and necessary and the experience of playing for black audiences also proves that the particular form of attack on the status quo employed by white artists such as the beats and the folk music crowd are not usually relevant to the problems of the black community also too often the particular form of rage employed by black writers against american facism designed for a white audience is not usually successful when applied to a black audience this means black theater will demand new plays written for black audiences it also suggests that alliances with white artists lose their value when such alliances man the sacrifice of our racial concept of reality any of this could be developed further by analyzing for instance the dilemmas of the black writer on the lower east side of manhattan scene or by analyzing the extent to which black theater or the black writer is of necessity more involved with a political and social art i would define black community theater as a theater which exists for and relates specifically to the black communities and which performs a critical function toward the values of white america and the values of the community of which it is a part that other thing which has at some points existed in the afro communities we may call negro thespian culturaluplife theater which is not what i have in mind the fst in began to move in the direction outlined above particularly because of the urging of founding director gil moses the program was modified to choose plays which had a particular relevance to our audience with postperformance discussions retained to evaluate effectiveness and break down the distance between stage and audience devote more time to new orleans through workshops in drama afroamerican literature and writing and to hire the most interested and talented teenagers as apprentices build a theater in the desire project section of new orleans suitable for both performances and an office though the season involved the most extensive schedule of performances it would be misleading to claim the realization of all the above objectives the full potential of the workshop program can only be exploited when the company can obtain a fulltime black community workshop specialist who if funds are available can stay in new orleans on a fullyear basis the workshop program is extremely important it means planting seeds which will not only insure the life of the theater as an indigenous community force but also planting seeds which will perform the essential functions of racial reeducation reevaluation and strength and to make the program work the fst needs funds to spend more time in the south than the seven months it was able to operate in it would also be misleading to imply that the changes in direction came easily in a company which has from its inception established its own artistic principles through vigorous debate redirection of program took a tremendous emotional toll a definition of principle no matter how simple it may sound when stated here required a reevaluation of the role of fst so fundamental that only the obvious need for such a theater saved the company from dissolution in the black community is there a need for theater at all when so many other needs seem to take precedence are workshops which have the advantage of dealing more directly with the community more valuable than performances what is the role of the white actor if any in a theater which is designed for the black community is traditional theater too refined or removed to capture the immediacies of the black community once the company resolved some of these issues and avoided floating away on the waves of perpetual theoretical discussion four shows were prepared gil moses aforementioned roots our own poetry show utilizing the works of contemporary afroamerican and african poets does man help man by brecht and i speak of africa by william plomer played as a doublebill the most critical and enthusiastic audiences are not the new york sophisticates familiar with theater or the drama but people who relate in the most natural and sophisticated way to what happens on the stage that is when the theater accepts the obligation to present something which relates to the lives of the audience and does it well sometimes the discussions were more entertaining than the shows the poetry show almost precipitated what would have been an extraordinary scuffle between lovely denise nicholas and a booker t washington black policeman in a desire church does man help man provoked a sncc staffer to threaten to slap down a morehouse prefreshman in atlanta as success means audience community involvement this is the measure of success as the fst approaches its season there is for the first time solidity of structure and enough funds to enable planning for a few months last year the company received a grant from the rockefeller foundation which made possible the extension of the season through june july august and september this year the rockefeller foundation awarded fst a followup grant of the amount for three seasons earmarked for each year to decrease annually approximately is budgeted for the new york foundation has also contributed thus with a budget of roughly after bills are paid the fst is assured of a six or sevenmonth season paying approximately twelve people an average of per week this money does not include allowance for a workshop director in new orleans for more than the six or seventh month the company will be able to stay together for the workshop program to work the community director shuld really operate on a yearround basis the current budget also does not include funding for apprentices teenagers who can only afford to spend time with fst if they are paid because all of them need summer jobs if we cant pay them theyll get a cleaning job somewhere to conclude that the present budget provides for more than a minimum program would be an illusion to augment financing the board of directors has worked to expand its friends of the fst committee in new york and to create a similar group in new orleans led by mrs celestine cook mrs lucille segre and rev milton upton approval of federal tax exemption on gifts to fst has been an encouragement but the fst has hardly received generous financial support from people in new orleans the friends groups are also important for as the theater continues to play a politically and racially controversial role it may be very likely that foundation support will cease at the same time it is important that the fst remain a free theater because only a theater which performs without charge can reach every level of the community and what is more important every age group this season the company will produce another poetry show utilizing the works of young black poets it is also hoped that a youth who plays and sings firstclass new orleans blues can be enticed to join the company for blues which is such a historically viable art in black culture must be explored to its full potential in a black theater fst is looking for scripts by black writers but experience with black audiences is of prime value a few final personal messages to murray levy see you in madrid after viewing la guerre est finie to denise nicholas roscoe orman joe perry gil moses john oneal see you in madrid to gordon parks thanks for the station wagon but it has had it if you know anyone else who wants to duplicate your generosity have them contact fst at box new orleans immediately will send driver to sam hill john cook arnold innis gil mathews ollie smith freddie donald dehon lieteau and gil fletcher madrid i love you the fst belongs to you this paper will deal with three subjects race war and politics t i believe they have always determined the direction of this nation i believe we stand on the brink of catastrophe right now because of them one hundred and ninetyone years ago war was the mother of our country we were born of violence the politics of revolution were spearheaded by men who believed in the dignity of man but being economically subordinate to england robbed them of that we know that those intellectuals pondered long and with both logic and emotion about the status of a man who was a man a white man was of course a man but an indian a negro slave or free the question was left hanging and we are still dealing with it within and without the nation liberty yes freedom but of course for some but not for all let me take you back to a short time before our rebellion really got under way let me take you to boston and to crispus attucks chris attucks one of the first men to die in the boston massacre was charged with starting the riot but did he in fact by his actions instigate the massacre there are some sidelights that should speak for themselves first of all chris attucks was a runaway slave he was over six feet tall and they used to tell stories about his knockknees it seems unlikely that a runaway slave would draw attention to himself by leading a mob through boston streets and look what patriot was going to allow himself to be led by a black man anyway in any case attucks died when a column of british soldiers opened fire in king street he died instantly with two others eleven other people were wounded and two of these died later john adams above the protests of the citizens defended the soldiers and declared attucks appears to have undertaken to be the hero of the night and to lead this army with banners to form them up in the first place in dock square and march them up to king street with clubs it was attucks to whose mad behavior in all probability the dreadful carnage of this night is chiefly to be ascribed the attorney for the people samuel adams however revealed that attucks was leaning upon a stick when he fell which certainly was not a threatening posture did john adams long a prominent figure in massachusetts politics find in attucks a scapegoat a corpse could not speak for itself and wasnt it easier to charge the provocation of the incident on a dead negro slave than on a live white patriot we do not know we can only surmise what we do know is that attucks now enshrined in copper on the boston commons became one of the martyrs of the rebellion and the colonists needed martyrs whether they were black white or red three years later speaking of red persons crept aboard three ships in boston harbor and threw overboard cases of tea this was the old boston tea party of course the members of the party were disguised as indians why the disguises why those disguises the british werent afraid of indians they had beaten them rather badly in the french and indian wars no our patriots in order to evade detection participated in a charade of racism put the blame on the negro put the blame on the indian our minds bend naturally in that direction anyway because they have different color skins and they above all are the most vulnerable people in our society racism was a part of our national psychology before the constitution was framed from boston harbor we advance to concord bunker hill and lexington if you remember your history you know that it was every state militia for itself and every town for itself congress hadnt been formed yet there was no such thing as an american army and politics were local choose any of these shrines of liberty peer into the nearby brush or any woodpile that served as cover and yes you did find a negro therein both woodpile and brush ill only bore you with a few names peter salem salem poor cuff whittemore cato stedman cato bordman some of the northern slave owners liked greek and roman names while others had no imagination at all for some of the black patriots bore names like george negro charles negro emmanuel negro and negro james these black militiamen did just as well as the black gi is doing in vietnamonly they didnt have television in those days or high speed printing presses so not many people knew about it but when the plans for a unified war were made black militiamen were ordered to turn in their guns and clubs because the colonies decided that it would be too dangerous and unwise to keep them armed whether they were slave or free besides it looked as though there might be such a thing as an american army then there would be a lot of white men to fight for this precious thing called freedom thus it was quite natural for slaves to gather in the roads in the dust of the riders who called out to arms to arms the british are coming the british promised to free the slaves if they joined the redcoats and they did to such an alarming extent that the continental congress which was having trouble rounding up all the patriots anyway now that the fighting was to be in earnest reversed its field and once more black soldiers found their way into the ranks of the fighting men some of them historian walter millis points out that it was embarrassing to the patriots to be fighting for liberty while maintaining the institution of slavery it was almost equally embarrassing on the other hand to be accused of raising a servile army to fight libertys battles for them many american commanders complained about their troops general philip schuyler wrote from saratoga in complaining that one third of the soldiers he had been sent were boys old men and negroes of course later he wrote they disgrace our arms is it consistent with the sons of freedom to trust all to be defended by slaves under the command of horatio gates the americans won a decisive battle over the british at saratoga what would general schuyler have to say if he were in vietnam today i wondernegroes continued in the ranks until the war was won we had liberty now and freedom we were independent but we still had slavery and in fact most of the black soldiers who were slaves were not set free for their services they were returned to slavery it is no wonder that the rhodesian unilateral declaration of independence sounds so much like ours within just a few years we found ourselves in trouble again the british and french although engaged in a war with each other were busily impressing our seamen we were only half as disturbed by that as by the prospect of snitching a bit more land from them while they were scrapping so the impressment of our sailors gave us the excuse and we rushed northward to canadaonly to be repulsed by the british and their allies the poor worthless indian we just barely saved our skins up there we never did get canada our sea forces saved us and fortunately for us we did manage to win two or three important land battles but the going was so rough that the new england states threatened to secede from the union the war was not very popular there that war of then we got lucky and won a few down south at new orleans andrew jackson who had had to issue a call for negro volunteers to help repel the british who had landed in finally threw them back if jackson had lost the british would have had a foothold in the south with access to florida still held by spain the land acquired by america through the revolution and the treaty of and the great land mass of the louisiana purchase if youre ever down around louisiana back country and you hear someone speak of freejacksyoull know that these negroes are the descendants of the free negroes who fought with jackson we need not go into the mexican war except to say that after texas became independent it stood outside the union for almost years it took that long to decide whether texas should be a slave state or a free state it came in as a slave state now we approached the civil war our past had been marked by expansion a sloppy foreign policy brought about in part by the distance between washington and european capitals the pioneer had become the early westerner the factories of the north bursting with energy and raw materials were famished for manpower and much of it came from abroad the indentured white servant was vanishing the slave trade had been halted but slavery continued with about slaves mostly in the south our ties to france and great britain were adequate and some of this was due to the cotton we were producing down on the old plantation then mr lincoln went into the white house now he had made clear his position on slavery he had expressed sympathy for the slave but he also made it clear that if one race had to be superior then he preferred that white men hold that position the south was not convinced they did not believe this was due to mr lincolns equivocating on the issue and so we entered the war drawn by south carolina on a winter night in the north possessed per cent of the population along with over per cent of all the factories it produced per cent of the nations wealth held per cent of all the bank deposits and owned per cent of all the farms the south could put into the battlefield only a little over a million white males between the ages of and the north on the other hand had white males of the same ages but the souths great slave population made the difference for it allowed the southerners to release for duty a larger number of white males than the north could spare from its industrial complexes two hundred thousand negroes in regiments fought for the union in the civil war and it was the opinion of many people that without those negroes the south would have won its independence before the north was reeling from the effect of confederate victories and general sherman said nobody can save the country our men are not good soldiers they brag but they dont perform what is in store for us i dont know president lincoln sent out a call for menand got less than in five weeks by the end of summer he saw but one course he wrote i now determined upon the adoption of the emancipation policy and without consultation with or the knowledge of the cabinet i prepared the original draft of the proclamation and after much anxious thought called a cabinet meeting on the subject secretary of state william seward who later would provide a house for harriet tubman was horrified he cried it may be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted governmen a cry for help the government stretching forth its hand to ethiopia instead of ethiopia stretching forth her hand to the government lincoln then delayed the proclamation but the second union defeat at bull run forced him to stretch forth the hand of his government to ethiopia he issued the emancipation proclamation on january states and locales fighting on the union side were allowed to keep their slaves by august of lincoln could write the use of colored troops constitutes the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion to another correspondent he wrote drive back to the support of the rebellion the physical force which the colored people now give and promise us and neither the present nor any coming administration can save the union navy secretary gideon wells said there is an unconquerable prejudice on the part of many whites against black soldiers but all our increased military strength comes from them since the proclamation did not free all the slaves a thirteenth amendment was necessary a decade after the war the south was back in the hands of the rebels where it still is and the process of inventing a creature called the negro moved into a brand new and ugly phase perhaps it was so ugly in the south because the southerner knew that this black man this slave had turned the tide against him this was the most important war in our history and all we give our school children from it is that mr lincoln freed the slaves what the hell kind of history is that the facts are available and they speak for themselvesand very loudly this would have been a very different country if it had not been for blacks whose descendants are still screaming for the same liberty they made possible for white people over years ago if we had recognized that fact and honored that very real obligation it might have changed the course of our history within and without from the very beginning they say that the longest journey begins with but a single step perhaps we took that step with crispus attucks and the boston tea party quite probably even before without how did we fare we had the monroe doctrine but that was unilateral and supported by the british because they held like commercial interests with ours this british participation blocked the attempts of the holy alliance of the great powers in europe to extend its influence into the western hemisphere the alliance collapsed in which was why when the civil war began those europeans could take the time to pick and choose a possible winner and cast lots with him two years after the war we bought alaska from russia for one penny an acre or a little over at this same time france was ending a war in mexico and the british were preparing to consolidate in africa the claims made by its many explorers and missionaries a new confederation was established in north germany and the francoprussian war was about to begin everyone for the time being was busy a new era was in the making while the british and french despite their differences and the germans as well were striving for new territories in africa we pushed westward our dark continent was our own west of chicago and kansas city while the europeans were busily slaughtering andor converting the heathen in africa and asia we set about doing the same in the west we had to link the east and west coasts we had to put down rails so the trains could run somebody said there was more gold and silver and more of our eastern citizens came west there were already some people out here they were indians and they were in the way the trains couldnt run safely the wagon trains were in danger the miners couldnt dig gold and fight at the same time there was only one answer we had cleared the eastern seaboard of the indian and we could do it in the west we made bad treaties with the indians the kind of treaties we wouldnt offer a white man and we killed them they killed some of us too but we did the better job wed brought over the chinese to help build the railroads and when they were finished we shipped them back or in any case passed an immigration law that wouldnt allow any more chinese into the country in the meantime we ran the indians to death and when we didnt we put them on reservations the sorry thing for black people about what was done to the indians was that four negro regimentstwo infantry and two cavalryhelped do it as a matter of fact if george armstrong custer had accepted the colonelcy he was offered in the ninth cavalry regimentnegrohe might not have wound up dead at little big horn with the seventh for all that we did to the indian there are still regions in this nation where the population density is far less than persons per square mile we could have lived with the indian he became for generations of white children the object of fantasy upon which they demonstrated their masculinity and superiority that is whenever they tired of negro objects all the movies and television aside we know that the indian did win some battles we also know that we beat him not always by force of arms and men but by treachery the kind of treachery in which we rationalized away the inherent racism of this nation you know we look upon ourselves as a peaceloving people our slogans of peace are always in the air always on the lips of our leaders but in fact this is a myth we must destroy in order to look at ourselves and see what we really are since our armies have managed to acquire more square miles on this globe by naked military power than any other nation except great britain it has been a neck and neck race between the british and the americans with the british seizing square miles and the americans square miles in both cases most of this mileage was taken from people who were not of anglosaxon heritage we had now entered the time of the weak presidents they were men about whom nothing much can be said except that they did the best they could they were probably better officers in the union army than they were politicians except cleveland and arthur who had not seen military service the major political parties that had crossed the horizon since were almost down to the two major parties of today immigration to the united states was reaching floodtide and the oppressed europeans became an american with a vengeance while the south was recapturing the political machinery the negro had held for only a brief time in the north a new kind of politics came into being the m local politician the district leader became the hyphenated americans pipe line to direct political action the new american countedsometimes even if he lay dead under a tombstone negro americans lost all voice in the politics of the south and therefore in the nation and as a result a century and four years after the emancipation proclamation the politics of the south remain unrepresentative of all the people of that region that condition does not hurt the south or hurt the blacks alone it wounds all of us and the larger wound is perhaps still to come consider that tonight in the south or in one of the northern ghettos there is a negro boy or girl who given the chance could find a cure for cancer the political action of the south created a political reaction in the north to which the negro fled southern political imbalance is being balanced out in the great cities of this nation and as whites leave those cities for the suburbs the blacks more and more are being left behind to determine the politics of cities like new york chicago detroit and san francisco and the more they determine politics the more sullen grows the rest of the nation this as history has proved and is proving still is traditional there is something about nonwhite people holding power that makes us terribly uneasy close to the turn of the century we once again took advantage of someone elses misfortune flexed our muscle and went in to help the little guy weve always managed to come out with more than we went in with this time it was the spanishamerican war we began our history there as a world power an empire we hadnt had a decent war in years and we were looking for one the insurrection of the cubans against spain gave us that opportunityand the explosion aboard the maine now considered to have been an accidentto enter the war on the side of the rebels we came out of that war with cuba puerto rico guam and the philippines we returned cuba to the spanish and since we were now in business in the pacific we picked up the hawaiian islands which by now were americandominated anyway some of our troops stationed in the philippines made a trip to the chinese mainland in to help put down the boxer rebellion the boxers resented the empress dowager tzu hsi and the foreigners she allowed to run the bulk of commerce in china the boxers whose name translated from the chinese means league of the united patriots killed several hundred foreigners therefore we joined the english russian german french and japanese armies to force the chinese to let us conduct business in their land the white nations allowed japan to participate in this business deal because the japanese were militarily strong the strongest nation in the east in another four years japan was destined to win a war with russiasomething the combined armies of europe under napoleon couldnt do the nations of the west were astounded but they recovered quickly enough to limit drastically the war claims of japan implanting in that nation a sense that it would never be dealt with fairly in the courts of the western governments in japan became a major nonanglosaxon military power and as the years wore on it was with some relief that the nations in the west let it work off its muscle in asia but first there was world war i a war we were drawn into not because we wanted to save european democracy as well as ours which in reality did not exist for millions of americans black and white and brown anyway but because we resented the efforts of the germans to loose not only the mexicans but the japanese upon us our president mr wilson feared the yellow peril as much as it intrigued kaiser wilhelm and after all we had treated the mexicans badly enough to fear that given the chance they would retaliate in kind eventually our policy of neutrality severely tested in many incidents finally had to go by the board and so we went to the war what was that war all about we know of the balance of power of assassinations of diplomatic skullduggery but was the war fought for pieces of europe really yes the germans did want to move south and east yes the russians did want to protect their black sea ports yes the french wanted to regain alsace and lorraine the japanese who came in on the side of the allies in still wanted manchuria however dr w e b du bois the late negro scholar and historian asserted that the real spoils of victory lay in africa not in europe african possessions gave a great amount of wealth to france england belgium and germany the slave trade had been the springboard by which england and then france came to their industrial revolutions and later imports from africa costing almost nothing to produce became major underpinnings in the economies of the european nations italy had a small colony in africa belgium spain and portugal held territories germany held lands in the east southwest and west nearly all the possessions were many times larger than the nations that owned them the congo for example was times larger than belgium and you could put france into algeria about five times africas a big place you can put the united states into it more than three times over the great rift valley in africa is longer than the united states is wide it was from the black mother that america secured its uranium which would light the sky over hiroshima and nagasaki in ten million people died in world war i in which almost american negro troops participated on a segregated basis the austrohungarian empire was broken up at the wars end and it became a series of feeble countries austria hungary czechoslovakia yugoslavia poland was declared independent rumania got a part of the old empire france got alsace and lorraine italy was given a bit of the rugged although very beautiful land north of its own boundary but these gifts had been gifts before in other times in short they were merely changing hands once again historian milton meltzer describes the end of the war when the negro soldiers returned homethe sound rolled up fifth avenue gathering power at every block the crowds packed on the sidewalks began to cheer as soon as the wave of noise hit their ears by the time they could see the two thousand gleaming bayonet tips far down the street they were yelling their welcome new yorks negro soldiers were back home the first american troops to go up front they stayed in the trenches consecutive days not one man was captured not one trench was surrendered not one foot of ground was given up they fought their way to the rhine they were the first american soldiers to win the highest french decoration the croix de guerre the entire regiment won it for gallantry under fire the next day a negro was lynched in georgia two negroes were lynched every day of that year which was nothing had changed for the negro but big changes were taking place in africa germany lost its colonies and they were taken over by the british and french and south africans japan did not receive the balance of manchuria instead it was given mandates over some islands of the pacific we would not know the names of those islands until world war ii mandates through the league of nations were a big item everyone got them on the other hand had germany won the war its new african colonies from france and england added to those it already held might have made unnecessary the quest for living space which led to the second world war ill make a flat prediction right now in the years ahead the dominant foreign influence in africaunless africa resists that intervention more strongly than it now iswill not be american or russian it will be german in the bewildering void being created between the americans and the russians the germans not the chinese are winning friends and influencing people the italians gained nothing new in africa for their service with the allies which was precisely why they returned to ethiopia in after having been beaten by the ethiopians in haile selassie is still the emperor of ethiopia in when i was ten years old there was a lot in the papers and on the radio about selassie and most of it was funny there was nothing funny about his going before the league of nations to protest italian activity on his borders the league sat on its hands and the italians invaded from a distance of years one can see that that action was a turning point in world history the sanctions the league applied to italy were useless the unwillingness and inability of the league to take meaningful action against italy finally broke that organization which was weak to begin with because we were not a member it can be assumed that if ethiopia had been a white nation the issue might have been better resolved as for us we wouldnt have cared less the degree to which white america oppressed the negro was astounding as horrible as were the deaths of the three civil_rights workers in neshoba county mississippi in and two of them were white you will recall believe me when i tell you that they died easily compared to the way a multitude of negroes were dying in the american south in the year we are above all racially consistent the spanish civil war began the following year and the league was unable to prevent the germans and italians from joining the conflict on the side of the monarchists we continued our isolationist binge choosing only to harass those americans who fought with the loyalists spain you see is where africa begins according to the seasoned traveller as far as the british are concerned the niggers begin at calais so the anglosaxons were pretty cool about what was going on in that latin country we watched divebombing tactics being perfected at guernica and believed they had nothing whatsoever to do with us the spanish people had elected a republican government and it was substituted in blood for an unlawful one which we have supported so we came still unprepared to world war ii we would go up against the blooded legions of the germans italians and japanesefor the japanese were finally taking the manchuria that neither the treaty of in which president teddy roosevelt was involvednor participation in world war i brought them like most western nations we were content to let the japanese and chinese fight it out what did it matter to us what those wiley oriental gentlemen did to each other as long as they didnt rock our boat while they were doing it ethiopia spain manchuria the great american depression inevitably there was hitler and the japanese militarists this time the japanese threat to our west coast was real so we went to war it is quite possible that if the japanese hadnt attacked pearl harbor we might not have gone to war despite the feeling of many government officials that we should have even before our navy was wrecked we didnt seem to care about hitlers camps or the ovens that would start snuffing out the lives of millions of people because they were jews communists homosexuals or antinazis we appeared to be content to stay in isolation lynching negroes oppressing mexicans and puerto ricans and working our way out of the depression hours after the attack on pearl harbor this nation came alive like a raging lion never again would we be isolated from the rest of the world we had at that time our finest hourand our worst we were at the same time heroes and racists while some americans were signing up others moved rapidly to isolate the japaneseamericanswe put over in camps confiscated their property and all too often divided it among ourselves but we were also at war with germany and italy from to there were more german immigrants to america than from any other nation italians made up six per cent of the population in new york new jersey and connecticut in new york and a few other large cities pronazi germanamericans paraded openly in the street and yet to the endless shame of this nation we imprisoned only the japaneseamericans why didnt we imprison german and italianamericans as well we know the reason for that dont we then we had the gall the absolute gall to ask the japaneseamericans to volunteer for combat in order to prove they loved this nation and damned if they didnt volunteer the nd regiment made up of japaneseamericans became the most decorated regiment in the army in world war ii we only had gall they had manhood as we all know after the blitzkrieg that brought europe to its knees the war continued on in north africa now all europe was hurting allied strategy first recommended that the attack be carried to hitlers fortress europe directly but that was changed and the battlefield became africa because the allies could not afford to let the germans hold it africa was the place where the european allies would have to begin anew if england fell we know that the french for a time did have their military headquarters there so once again africa became a focal point for the survival of western civilization from african victories the allies sprang to italy from italy into france and then on into germany in the pacific we fought a race war against the japanese and they fought one against us surely on the basis of our previous contacts with them wed given them few reasons to trust anglosaxons we did not try to hide our contempt for them and in the end against the advice of albert einstein we dropped the bomb on them yes we dropped the bomb on them and i believe that every nonwhite person on this miserable globe of ours is convinced that had the bomb been ready before the european war was over we still would have dropped it on the japanese and not the germans the japanese after all are not white they are not anglosaxon or caucasian seven hundred thousand american negro troops were engaged in the war against the italians germans and japanese again on a segre gated basis i was one of them we were lynched in the training camps set aside from white americans we were refused food in the restaurants of the south while german prisoners of war were welcomed with the battle of the bulge however out of necessity once more the army ground forces in europe became somewhat integrated it looked as though the germans were about to break through and every available man was needed with the war won we found ourselves the undisputed leaders of the world we were not used to such power such vast influence and we handled it like a hot potatowhich was exactly what it was roosevelt was dead and truman stood in his place the result of the might of the south no northern president could be elected unless his vice president was a southerner or a border state resident or a man whose policies indicated sympathy for the southern way of life these men who have run our nationand you think about this came to their power because of their positionshinted stated or unstatedon the racial dilemma of this land that has been going on for a long long time in my opinion harry truman proved to be a better president than we had a right to expect he did make decisions he ordered the bomb dropped he put in motion the marshall plan he offered some of the firstpostwar civil_rights legislation and for his pains the southerners created their dixiecrat party of this party was but one more product of american racial attitudes europe was in shambles but they didnt care much about that the bomb had been dropped and that didnt bother them too much but when it came to equality for the black american they really lost their cool as this socalled negro revolution ebbs and flows politicians are using it to advance themselves and to retard the country lets not be deceived by the slogans of nullification states rights crime in the streets and hoodlumism they all mean the same thing no equality for the negro as an american i would think that many other americans would grow sick and tired of what these attitudes have done to the nation and the world i would be tired of the cottonaccented or general americanaccented tones that mouth the outmoded concept of black inferiority i would be tired of the bilbos and faubuses the doubletalking northerners i would throw up my hands at the farce being perpetrated against the people of alabama today and quite possibly the rest of the nation tomorrow george and lurleen wallace however you slice it owe their doubtful preeminence to racial hatred and this hatred is a thing which act by act situation by situation has become a functioning and necessary part of our national psyche after the war we set up nato we were one of fourteen nations we had to carry the other the taxes of all americans went to europe to save it from communism we were so busy in europe that we almost forgot about our adventures in china and the rest of the orient we had to think about it again because the regime of chiang kai shek was that year swept to formosa by the communists once again we had backed the wrong horse i have mentioned the boxer rebellionthat was when the chinese man in the street rebelled against outsiders capturing the commercial interests of his country we first went to china in following the opium wars in when was a kid there were a great many movies about the chinese being opium fiends they were the guys who when high on opium kidnapped the blonde blueeyed girls you know the bit the opium wars you may remember began because the british imported opium into china from places like burma the chinese government knew very well what opium could do to its people and resisted the british insisted on bringing it inat great cost to the chinese the chinese lost those wars opium not only flowed freely through the provinces but england france and the us were given freedom to call at the treaty ports of shanghai canton and others britain also gained hong kong it was a case of the west ramming down the throat of the east not what was good for the orientals but what was good and damned profitable for caucasians in washington dc the newsmen still remember with great fondness the china lobby of chiang kai shek it gave the most splendid parties in town girls booze and excellent chinese food were available for the asking only in did it become crystal clear that chiang was through we woke up late surprisingly late to the information that people who were not white could adopt a modern social order such as communism and when we did wake up we didnt know where to begin as late as when african nations were becoming independent we still didnt know what to do so we reverted we tried to pay africa and africans as we have done with the rest of the world to play ball with us but in china there were now about million souls ruled by a political philosophy that was alien to us counting russia far over a billion ideological enemies not counting the sovietbloc nations so seven years after we signed the nato pact we had to go to manila and draw up a similar contract with eight nations this time we called the contract the southeast asia treaty organization and it was signed in the same year that france also a member of seato was concluding its war in vietnam one year before we had reached an uneasy truce in korea what an odd lot that seato organization brought together america with her domestic racial problems and a neophyte in world relations which added up to insincerity and fumbling in our comer were the philippines a very obvious us satellite in the pacific there was france just beaten in vietnam splendidly democratic at home but its racial policies abroad left much to be desired great britain was there of course with two members of the commonwealth australia and new zealand australias racial policies were approaching those of south africa and our own american south then there was pakistan and thailand the pakistani people feel the brunt of much of the british racism when they are in england the great powers of the west sat down with these little countries and wrote out a pacific charter affirming the rights of asian and pacific peoples to equality and selfdetermination the antiaggression and economic provisions were extended in vietnam we were building a ring around china then just as we had created a ring of allies around russia we thought we could isolate communism shut it off from the rest of asia and the world we had discovered during the korean war that we were faced with an implacable enemy a people who were glad to build our railroads do our laundry and serve fortune cookies in cute little restaurants smelling of strange teas but no more korea was first colonized by the chinese in the th century and down through the years both the chinese and japanese fought over it the japanese took it over as a result of their war with russia korea was promised to the chinese during the cairo conference in but when the war was over the country was occupied by the americans in the south and the russians in the north then governments were set up north and south the rest is history we went to war there with our first integrated army and with the aid of united nations troops the war was a draw the country is still divided at the th parallel we began to form rings around china and there was much talk about the implausibility of conducting a land war in china we hoped and prayed that the yellow heathenthat is save chiang kai shek whom we were still supporting on formosawould not get their hands on the knowhow to make the bomb we still had that advantage i am an american seven generations in this land i am an afroamerican if you will i am a student of history a victimas we all areof life i am a father and husband and i am a writer and i believe a responsible citizen therefore what i have to say next i do not say lightly most americans have never been troubled by the great gap between the american creed and the american deed and i do not believe my words are going to change things one bit i wish they could but i know they wont it seems that all the words have been used upused so often that we respond only to the sound and not the meaning of them the american history of racism it is my firm conviction and i have tried to give a sketch of it has brought us today to a confrontation with deadly possibilities not with north vietnam but with china it is not the philosophy of communism that we fear any longer one has only to witness the degree to which we have managed to coexist with it and even managed to thrive because of it we have had opportunities to crush it we were in russia during world war i only when we were in danger in world war ii did we help them weve always gotten along well with tito the hungarians expected us to return to europe when they revolted but we didnt what makes us uneasy about the philosophy of communism is that it has great appeal with some modification to strange people like the dominicans cubans and africans but we can put up with them because after all they have not got the bomb the chinese have got the bomb they have got the bomb and this means that for the first time in history people who are not white are capable of administering almost as much death and destruction as white people the balance no longer is no white nation on this earth can claim to have been nice to the mainland chinese none and now we may force them to seek redress of grievances before i finish with china however let me go to south vietnam we have almost half a million troops there as far as we have been told and close to of them are negro many others are puerto rican a goodly number are rural white kids from the south ask a soldier what he is doing in vietnam and hell probably tell you hes defending freedom and democracy how dare we in the year with the socalled negro revolution climbing right up our backs and threatening to rip this country apart talk of freedom and democracy in vietnam there must be places within miles of most of us now where a negro gi just back from vietnam cannot stop to eat or sleep i know there are where i come from what are we doing in vietnam when here at home out of every thousand black babies die within a year of life while in vietnam out of every thousand die what are we doing burning homes children women and the aged who did not ask us to come in the first placeall they wish is relief from their landlords and why are black gis dying at the rate of per cent of the total casualties while making up only a bit over per cent of the population many of those boys have died without having a cup of watery coffee in an integrated five and dime storeso that many americans can have the privilege of exercising a sickening item called white backlash so what are we doing there involved in an undeclared war and without our major allies france and england this war is without slogans because the real reason for it is rooted in what we say we despise race hatred we are trying to draw china into a war i believe i think we have come to believe that we must before china finds the capability for delivering its bomb to the american mainlandor to russiawho one day will be our major ally vietnam is nothing it is an expensive excuse nothing more how can we be concernedhow can the vietnamese in the south expect us to be concernedwith their distant people when we have amply demonstrated to the entire world and for over years time and time again that we do not basically care for the black and brown millions in our own midst what we want is for the chinese to reach over and knock the chip from our shoulder wed like them to invade the south but if they dont we might invade the north and try to draw them down but they are sly yellow devils arent they they wont bite because they know that if they do we might unsheath a few of those metal monsters we will keep escalating until they do bite because we insist we have got to get them before they get us white power not yellow power must prevail and we have a justifiable sense of guilt about what we have done to the nonwhite world we just dont want to pay for it but nature contains its own awful balance john a williams author of the article race war and politics is one of americas leading novelists his newest book the man who cried l am which was completed in spain last winter is scheduled for publication this fall last spring his expanded and updated anthology beyond the angry black was published mr williams other books include the novels sissie and night song and the autobiographical travel book this is my country too the above article was delivered as an address at colorado state university i talk to friendly white people for the first e f time or for any length of time and often when i talk to f young black people and usually when i talk to anybody ab ut the blues i realize the vast and tragic gaps in our c understanding of the negro experience in america this is particularly evident in the current misunderstanding of the nature and dimensions of black consciousness one aspect of which black_power has received inordinatebecause distortedattention from the mass media it strikes me as strange that there should be such misunderstanding of black aspiration from literate people who really should know better for this insistence upon black consciousness of which black_power is a solid but flashy single factor is not unconnected with what has gone on before and what in effect has been sanctioned before by the literate public for example when richard wright said that he was a black boy and delineated that condition and refused to be a nigger when ralph ellison said that he was an invisible man when james baldwin said that nobody knew his name they spoke in powerful and moving and eminently distinctive voices for when wright asserted his blackness and repudiated his niggerness it was an act of personal purgation when ellison said that he was invisible it was an indictment and a challenge and when baldwin said that nobody knew his name it was a warning one need not belabor baldwins prophetic precision when this juxtaposition is obvious the fire next time burn baby burn or the fact that wright used the words black_power as the title for a book which in its reflection of essentially a white mans view of africa revealed the price he paid for integration and the repudiation of his niggerness or that ironically ellison was making invisibility a metaphor for blackness and incidentally for niggerness and black consciousness or that the whole socalled black movement on the social and political level at least is a series of exercises in strategic visibility or as ellison and leroi jones say so well black is blue the paradigm of the negro experience is the blues but when people talk about blues they usually talk about sociology or personal anecdote or about music usually jazz i submit that while it involves all these things it is also poetry at times of great profundity and if we examined it as such we would find out that black consciousness has been around for a long time and is likely not only to endure but to seducewhich is to say to prevail i have used the words nigger and niggerness in the same breath with black consciousness and i am pretty sure that most people who talk about black consciousness would probably repudiate any connection of this sort yet oddly enough these same people are searching for their roots in the folk culture of which the blues are a crucial part and the main burden of the blues is doing it and dues now all white people know that negroes are sexual prodigies though only a few white people know what negroes mean by paying dues schwerner and goodman and reeb and mrs liuzzo knew too well now white people also know what they mean when they say nigger after all they invented the word and the thing for a refresher here is a letter to eugene patterson the editor from the october issue of the atlanta constitution in when the students of virginia union university began picketing the stores with lunchcounters in downtown richmond someone sent the president a picture of a black gorilla charging through the african bush scrawled in huge letters were the words nigger this is you meanwhile in the newspapers the good people of virginia vented their venom while editorials spoke in unsubtle praise of carlton putnams race and reason in short a nigger is a bom halfape in hitlers phrase with rheumatism in all his joints and of course niggers are diseased and depraved something like swifts yahoos and they stink so as the american nazis say who needs niggers who indeed ask the old negro and he replies nobody and he tells his children stop acting like niggers and when he is disgusted with his folks he says just like niggers yet he also uses the word in a neutral sense to mean negro or as a term of affection to his very dear friend or even his wife warily he may allow his white friends to use the word in his presence to show that he is integrated sometimes in a kind of brotherly euphoria he even allows a special white friend jokingly to call him nigger who needs niggers ask the young blackman and he might cuss you out or knock you down no more of that never no goddamn more and he reminds you of the young richard wright yet the young blackman uses the word too quite often in the same manner that the old negro does though if he is a young blackman and not just a young negro chances are few white people even his closest friends would dare call him nigger and when he calls himself that or his friends there is an ironic distance in his voice which calibrates precise emotional reactions as in his use of the shortened form nig or the nig moreover despite his highly specialized use of the term and his repudiation of the white mans definition the young blackman in his concern with shattering stereotypes either consciously or unconsciously ventures into forms of speech dress and behavior which would elicit from the old negro the expression of resigned self contempt just like a nigger and in attempting to assert his independence of the white man in declaring his freedom as a natural man he deliberately courts at times it seems the white mans scorn so as to declare it irrelevant to his personal worth and freedom and so the repudiation of black and white middleclass values alike he takes a long hard look as it were at the idea of niggerness and because it embodies some of the deepest fears of western white men he discovers that it is useful he can use it as the basis of a new concept of self he can not only use it as the old negro did he can also use it as a weaponagainst the physical ghetto yes whether you condone his actions or not but also and more importantly against the ghettos of the mind and so in turning back to his roots as he says it he challenges the stereotypes sometimes he transforms them and with this transformation comes change in others around him old negroes and whitefolks alike he doesnt have to turn far before he comes to the blues the devil songs of doing it and dues for in them he finds the ancestral record of otherness or if you please of niggerness i have isolated vhnt i consider to be the main burden or themes of the bluesphysical iove with or without romance and suffering or doin it and dues a good example of what im talking about is a blues by furry lewis the great memphis blues singer and teacher of bessie smith he sings in white lightnin this is a very moving and typical blues some of it consists of standard blues lines which furry has assimilated and appropriated for his own use but the juxtaposition and the powerful condensation of feeling make it quite personal in the opening lines the terrible and paradoxical words reflect a mental state quite close to the alienation so often expressed in modem literature fix my breakfast so i can go to bed hes been up all night drinking trying to cure the blues we dont know what the cause is but it seems a fundamental despair both physical and philosophical so powerful that he has tried to erase it with the alcohol how appropriately then the name suits the mood and the stunning effect of the alcohol is like the paralyzing force of the blues themselves he has suffered as it were a double strokefrom the blues and from the white lightnin the next logical step physically should be sleep metaphysically death since the words are announced with all the anguish of physical and spiritual exhaustion before the second stanza he plays a boogiewoogie figure the music of copulation which announces a different kind of resolution and the language following after typical blues boasting standard blues lines implies a paradoxical and witty comment on the original mood suddenly he revives from the blue paralysis and is readyto take on a chocolate broad any one but the lines imply that he is already riding and what hes hauling is his own sweet chocolate which has burst through the paralysis as his life revives but the fear of the blues is there even in the act of regeneration it has made and will make him so desperate that he will do everything he can for the woman be good to her and for her then the boogiewoogie ride is over and the same train that hauled chocolate to the bone takes her away from him literally and logically there are inconsistencies of person and tense which confuse the literal meaning the baby in the first stanza is probably not the same as in the fifth and we moved from the immediate opening mood and place home in the present to another location in the present where he is trying to get someone to go home with him to still another place in the present presumably home where he mourns over someone who had left him in the past but the unity is one of mood and one which follows the laws of associationfrom the paralysis of the first two stanzas to the sexual solution of the three middle stanzas to the resignation of the last which implies a groping for something beyond love and an acceptance of the impermanence of love it takes us to the mysterious despair of the opening this obviously is not a mere longing for sex since the woman is already there so what then is this terrible despair that drives a man to oblivion it is the blues the characteristic cumulative effect of blackness in the united states its not just the background of jazz not just a sound the brown sound of the british rock and rollers nor simply a hybrid music which gropes for the quarter tones of african modalities nor is it a simple record of the more palatable and romantic aspects of blackness the soul of black folks in america it is again the characteristic effect of blackness in the united states and blackness in the united states means niggernessand niggerness is among other things a diseasethe disease of absurd otherness and the blues song is an existential record both of the symptoms and of the treatment it is a kind of homeopathya treatment of poisoning with a bit of the poison itself the live virus that makes the vaccine work thus any serious search for roots and black identity has to come fully to grips with this experience not just to isolate it and forget it but to incorporate it into a larger conception of self now make no mistake about it the blues experience this niggerness is a terrible disease it can kill dont sentimentalize that furry doesnt its a disease that lurks dormant in the blood even when apparently cured like malaria or syphillis and the price of the cure is so painful so great that you wouldnt in your right mind go out and catch it again now if this scourge this blues this niggerness is so terrible if it has been inflicted upon us for all these years if it has infected the whole social and political body of this country and damaged its soul in the process and if we have survived because we were too damn mean to crynot only because we got good religion but because we got good bread then we shouldnt ever forget the experience because it is a part of our uniqueness we shouldnt ever forget the experiences of niggerness the whole range of it if anything we should celebrate it ritualistically as the jews do passover or yom kippur if we are to be whole as a people we must in our new black pride as young black folks seem unconsciously to be doing acknowledge the full nature of the disease and transform it not pretend that it never existed for if it had never existed we never would have developed immunity there is a good deal of glib talk nowadays about telling it like it is often by people who dont know what it is and increasingly young black people will be unable to see it like it is because their music will have had its vitality filtered through fashionable mainstream interpretations and they themselves will as they attain middle class respectability theorize and romanticize the guts out of their ancestral experience in this country precisely at a time when it needs to be remembered they have to remember again the entire spectrum of blacknessthe negative part in the mind of white america and the selfhatred the selfabnegation the selfsurrender the selfrealization in their own anything less than this m and it has to be held simultaneously in the mindis less than the truth if its less than truth then its not whole but unhealthy diseased at worst niggerness without the blues this takes us back to the mysterious despair of furrys first stanza for the realization of the absurdity of niggerness can come at any time it can even come in church where it may be transmuted into a longing for godbecause the mechanism is there but when the religious mechanism isnt there it comes out like it isthe blues now in their churches european people and educated negroes call their blue feeling angst and philosophize learnedly about the death of god but the blues singer knows all about that and has been saying it for a very long time he knows that angst is the blues for god but that god is white he knows absurdity with shattering intimacy he has also developed a mechanism to handle it an art form which celebrates the brutal thrust of love into the cavity of the absurd and precisely because they deal with the abyss the stinking pit of hell without the mediating presence of god precisely because they have been so efficiently and systematically rejected by the world the blues singersthe blues peoplelove and long so desperately there is for them no theological solutionno god to wipe away their tears only a train sixteen coaches long that dont haul nothin but chocolate to the bone at this point we run into a set of complications modern urban blues soul music white blues and rock and roll i believe that although the performance of the blues has changed the blues as black experience as poetry as recordhasnt by this i mean that the essential elements of doin it and dues are still there though perhaps in different proportions there is in effect much more of the former than of the latter especially in white singing which is often a kind of debasement a kind of shamminginstant anguish and perpetual orgasm but the same can be said of many negro presentations which tend toward artiness and prettiness and pop appeal but b b king and ray charles especially and now james brown otis redding and aretha franklinthey know about dues too and though their appeal rests largely on their virtuosityso did that of bessie smith and jimmy rushing and blind lemon jefferson and dinah washingtontheir story is still the story of the blues the disease and the serum finally it is important to make these distinctions now because the blues element in current soul music is so often swamped by the superficial adaptations of gospel rhythms melodies and lyrics and with the insistent imitation of negro sound by skillful whites the whole value structure implicit in the words of the blues is threatened for america has the midas touch which turns blue notes into goldleaf before the blues are pressed like childs english and scottish popular ballads into five static and esoteric volumes let us realizeespecially you young blackman bluethat their tragicomic vitality can still save us from cynical political posturing from the hoppedup rhetoric of brotherhood from the saccharine confusions of adrenalin and soul a strong case could be a p made for the hypothe sis that popular social movements do not apjzai ss ik pear unty gai s to which they address themselves are already in the process of being achieved put another way it may be suggested that changes in the afroamerican freedom movement have followed rather than preceded changes in the situation of black people for as the political economic and social conditions of black people have improved so has the movement gained momentum and become negro digest august more articulate sophisticated and complex the absoluteif not relative conditions of black people have indeed improved and this absolute improvement is at the very basis of the increasing momentum of the movement for to be sure throughout our history black people have known disadvantages and deprivation but in the face of it and in spite of it enough have managed to secure educations hold jobs move to greener pastures and increase our numbers to advance the absolute condition of the group parallel to this advance can be traced the rise of a positive black consciousness that found expression in a direct assault on segregation in the civil_rights movement and in the call for black_power with each change in the character of the movement has come an enlargement of its objectives and with each improvement in life conditions has come new insights into the nature of our situation and problems having secured a reaffirmation of our civil_rights we can see that these in themselves are not enough for we have also advanced far enough to clearly see that while our absolute situation has improved our group as a whole is not progressing as rapidly as others and that our people and communities face relative stagnation this realization of group stagnation in the face of individual advancement has contributed to a heightening of black consciousness and to a new change in the course of the movement an unmistakeable indicator of this change of course has been the emergence of the slogan black_power the slogan served brilliantly to dramatize one of the fundamental aspects of the realities that face black people in the united states that of relative powerlessness in a society that is organized upon power manipulation the emergence of such a captivating slogan represents an important phase of a group movement yet even the most brilliant slogan suffers a sever limitation a slogan directs attention to a situation or a set of objectives but it cannot provide the guidelines by which the objectives embodied in the slogan may be achieved to bring forth these guidelines we must bring forth an ideology for while a slogan draws attention to a reality and sounds a call for action an ideology provides a framework that integrates concepts ideas means and ends into a program for action in this respect black_power can be viewed as a slogan of the ideology of black nationalism black_power has become a household phrase and like most slogans it has come to mean many different and often contradictory things in the minds of many black people the differing opinions and contradictions nonetheless must be viewed as unavoidable necessary and even desirable for the unleashing of this particular slogan has initiated a great debate among black people which holds the promise of enlightening and of resolving many of the dilemmas that plague even the most resolute among us yet again if this debate is to prove fruitful we must move beyond the slogan to the development of a viable ideology it is in the spirit of this great debate that this essay embraces the slogan black_power and argues in favor of pluralistic black nationalism as an ideology to serve the needs of black people in the united states historically and geographically nationalism has been interpreted and modified to meet the particular conditions of particular times and places the basic concept in nationalistic ideologies has been that members of a group however defined believe that they themselves should control and manage their own affairs at the risk of oversimplification we will define afroamerican black nationalists as those who wish to preserve and develop black communities and institutions in both a physical and spiritual sense those who wish to maximize black political economic and social power in order to control protect and enhance black communities institutions and black people those who wish to conserve create and protect the integrity of black culture and those who view their identity proudly and positively put simply we define pluralistic black nationalism as positive black consciousness expressed in institutional and structural terms in using this formulation it becomes obvious that we are suggesting a new definition of black nationalismor and perhaps more accurately we are suggesting a new application of the concept this application of black nationalism includes many black people who do not think of themselves as black nationalists but whose actions and sentiments are nationalistic within the confines of our definition and application viewed from this perspective we can see that black nationalism has had a long history among afroamericans in terms of organized movements this history can be traced from the emigration movements of the early nineteenth century to marcus garvey in the s to the nation of islam today yet also using our definition and application we find a definite motif of undefined black nationalism which expressed itself in black consciousness and concern and reached its high points in the convention movements of the s in the black literary renaissance of the s and in the intellectual political cultural social and economic ferment that is today transforming black america throughout the great debate black_power and black nationalism have been equated with the notion of a physical separation of black people from the united states this is an overly narrow view and does not apply to the main body of nationalistic sentiment among afroamericans which seeks to participate more fully in the total society this narrow view is based upon the false assumption that nationalism refers only to nationstate creation or affairs nationalism however can also apply to the desire for nationality group unity and it can exist when a multiplicity of nationality groups share the same country beyond the situation in the united states this multiplicity of nationality groups can also be seen in the cases of the frenchcanadians and the greekcypriots most importantly then while nationalist movements may or may not be separatist they may also be nonseparatist or pluralist moreover as c eric lincoln put it black nationalism addresses itself not to an existent state but a state of mind and it is in terms of a pluralist american society that black nationalism is here discussed in ideal terms a pluralist society may be thought of as one where distinct groups peacefully coexist within a country on a basis of mutual cooperation respect and civil equality each group may maintain a set of institutions parallel to those of other groups through which it may pursue its own needs and cultural interests so long as these pursuits do not encroach upon the civil_rights of other groups yet we must not view pluralistic black nationalism as a variation of the separate but equal theme for quite the contrary pluralistic nationalism aims at complete desegregationnot segregation a pluralistic society is completely compatible with the principles and spirit of democracy for pluralism affirms democracy just as segregation repudiates it a pluralistic black nationalism ideology offers means ends and programs commensurate with the needs for structural and institutional development in the black communities our arguments for such an ideology stem from a consideration of the nature of black communities their relationships to other communities and their problems afroamericans constitute a virtual nation within a nation this can easily be seen objectively by noting the various indexes of segregation which show that residential neighborhoods are becoming increasingly homogenous in their racial compositions equally visible are the black institutions associations and organizations which exist parallel to those of whites and other racial groups these structural features serve to show that to a great extent american society is organized upon the basis of race and ethnicity for it is common practice to define political units school districts and economic markets in terms of the racial and ethnic composition of the residential neighborhoods and communities within them yet black communities and the institutions organizations and structures within them are underdeveloped and beset with a whole range of problems these problems are grounded in the structural features of american society to use an analogy in many ways the relationships between black and white communities are similar to those between neighboring countries and to carry the analogy a step further these relationships are like those between the highly developed and the still developing countries of the world but we must not carry the analogy of neighboring countries too far we exist in one country actually and contrary to popular opinion black people are not outside the mainstream of american society we are very much a part of and influenced by the structure of this society but as a group we are near the bottom of it we are prisoners of it and we are stagnating and very nearly drowning in its vicious structural cycles thus our problems stem from our relative position in the society not our membership in it the issue which confronts us is not one of choosing between participation in the mainstream of american society and developing our own communities for we must do both at the same time rather the issue is given our historical and present position what form should our relationships to the rest of this society take we choose to face this issue by arguing for pluralistic black nationalism on the basis of three of many reasons first this society is structured around groups and the strength they can muster other groups have already used their own nationalism to advance their groups position second for black people the methods available for advancement are all qualified by the racism that pervades the entire society any plan any coalition must take this racism into consideration black nationalism offers the advantage of ever reminding us to maximize our own strength in order that we may relate to others from a position of relative independence rather than near absolute dependence third black nationalism as we have defined itblack consciousness expressed in structural and institutional termsis in keeping with our situation needs and goals men pursue their goals through institutions organizations and structures to change our relative position in the structure of this society we must create larger more comprehensive and modern institutions of our own and in our own communities the structural features of american society have held us in a vicious cycle of stagnation therefore we need structures of our own to break out of the cycle and move ahead at a pace comparable to the rest of the society if black communities are to develop and prosper black consciousness must be channeled into viable structures and institutions for in this highly organized society an unorganized people can exert little influence but paradoxically all the ingredients for the development of viable institutional and organizational structures now exist in black communities except for a broadly based and widely understood ideology to coordinate our efforts forge the needed institutions and structures and lift our communities out of their relative stagnation we must face the unpleasant suspicion that we may have devoted more energy to attempting to enter the institutions of other groups than we have to developing our own we may have thus come perilously close to portraying ourselves as pawns rather than brokers the ingredients for development can all be foundand so can a catalystin pluralistic black nationalism despite our internal confusions and problems we are neither helpless nor inadequate to administer our own affairs our positions of powerlessness and deprivation are relative not absolute we do have both the actual and potential resources by way of example we will use the point of view of pluralistic black nationalism to explore two of the many potential areas of black development politics on the level of local organization and economic development in the retail sector pluralistic black nationalism and local political development politics have proven to be the most successful weapon in our black_power arsenal and its impact has been greatest on the local level black people are concentrated in the urban areas thus it has been in the city governments that black people have come closest to achieving the ideal of a pluralist societyproportional representation in the centers of power for example black people represent about per cent of the united states population but only per cent of the federal con gressmen are black yet if we examine a local level such as in cleveland ohio we find that black people comprise about per cent of the citys population and hold onethird of the city council seats thus on the federal level our power is more or less symbolic but on many local levels black political power is real and significanteven if not always decisive conditions of the times dictate that we must move from strength to success to do this we must accelerate the development of the local or grass roots base of our political power local governments in nearly all cases create control and administer school systems zoning and housing codes welfare programs refuse collection and many other daytoday government services local governments ultimately determine where new streets will be built or not built where housing codes are enforced or not enforced police policies and the nature of the local tax base these matters play a major role in the lives and development of communities even when programs originate on the federal or state level they are usually administered in the local level many of the problems which plague black communities can be traced to the decisions and policies of local government these range from overcrowded schools and housing to zoning decisions that can quickly undermine black property values deteriorate black neighborhoods and create slums black political power applied to the local government level is obviously one of the means by which black communities can attack problems and protect their interests and pluralistic black nationalism is an ideology to make the connection between often obscure government decisions and the wellbeing of black communities unfortunately the importance of local politics and local government is sometimes overlooked black politicians are almost universal in noting that while the situation is improving black political organizations still suffer from a lack of yearround community participation funds organizers and candidates who are willing to run for officeparticularly local office the qualified people exist but the importance of local organization and of capturing local offices is too often not fully appreciated and as a political leader in houston texas observed black people vote the right way when they vote the point is that effective political organization requires much more than registering voters once registered black voters need information and insight into the subtleties of the issues many of the vitally important issues which have consequences for a community can easily escape the notice of the lay man if these issues are not brought to his attention and explained this is not only a question of having the leaders who are alert to the issues it is also a question of having the channels of communication for disseminating the information and this is a function of effective organization we have achieved some successes through politics but in the light of the problems that still face us despite these successes we must continue to develop our political potential and forge it into effective organizations and to do this we must have a reference frame from which we can recognize consider and evaluate the issues and decisions which influence our lives and we must have a comprehensive program for action pluralistic black nationalism meets both of these needs pluralistic black nationalism and retail ecoiqmic develop ment in the field of economic development pluralistic black nationalism is a particularly useful approach to channeling black consciousness into institutional structures for as we noted above the powerlessness of black people is relative not absolute just as we carry political ballots that are significant so too we carry potentially effective economic ballots in the form of our consumption and investment dollars in terms of developing black communities how and where a black man spends his dollars are just as important as how he votes for by investing our consumer and investment capital in our own communities we can generate additional resources reduce unemployment and increase our selfsufficiency and freedom as long as we are a part of this society we should be full members of its economic common market along with the other nationality groups and we should enjoy the mutual benefits of our common membership yet black communities resemble still developing countries with balanceoftrade problems too much of our communities resources flow outward this trend must be reversed and it can be we can cast our consumer and investment ballots for our own communities perhaps we are not yet in the position to become large scale producers of goods but still we can own manage and control the retail outlets in our communities we can trade for the goods and services that we cannot produce for ourselves neither are black people penniless for indeed there is gold in the black valleysnot to mention the hills the dollars we all spend for food shelter clothing drugs gasoline etc are the dollars that can support black retail outlets and not only are there consumer dollars in the back community there are surplus dollars as well that can be wooed into capital investment to build the retail facilities the task at hand is to provide competitive and attractive consumer outlets and investment opportunities for these dollars but the age of the small individual entrepreneur is passing today economic institutions are large and corporately owned rather than attempt to develop small and marginal shops black people must and have done so create corporations on a larger and more efficient scale the attractiveness of retail development stems from the fact that many of the jobs created by it can utilize unskilled labor and thus draw upon the vast reservoir of the black unemployed retail jobs even up to the management level do not necessarily require extensive formal educations these jobs require literacy diligence and skills that can either be learned onthejob or after a short training period most black people are literate almost all are used to hard work and enough are nationally conscious of the extent that they will go out of their way to support a black business community if given good and fair service and attractive investment opportunities it is not enough to depend upon jobs in institutions industries and businesses controlled by those who live outside the black community this is not to argue that black people should not have jobs outside the black community but rather to recognize that there are not enough of them forthcoming we are all familiar with black unemployment figures and we have seen the reports which show that the average black man with some years of college education earns less than the average white man with an eighthgrade education surely part of this discrepancy stems from the fact that even after black people achieve formal educations they still suffer at the hands of white employers many black people have educations but we have failed to create enough institutions to provide us with job opportunities untouched by racism it is no accident that with the exception of entertainers the groups of black people who have done best economically are those professionals and businessmen who draw their incomes from black clients and customers it is not then enough for black people to be employees we must also be owners capital plus labor equals profit or surplus capital for the owners of the capital when this surplus capital flows out of a community stagnation results black communities will develop only as surplus capital is channeled back into them another advantage of retail development is that it is in keeping with the trends of the overall economy automation and technological advances are decreasing the relative numbers of production workers needed while at the same time raising the required educational level the big job demands of the future can be expected in the service and white collar industries which include the retail sector and in the construction trades retail development creates a demand for construction and jobs such as managers sales people service men etc and at the same time creates new clients and customers for black professionals businessmen and financial institutions most important black retail development would generate additional resources and rechannel them back into the community to stimulate further growth retail outlets are dependent upon production but the actual situation is one of mutual dependency or interdependency for as much as the retail outlets need the products of the production centers the production centers in turn need retail outlets to distribute their products an argument can even be made that the retail or consumption sector is somewhat more important in a surplus economy such as ours united states industries operate below capacity they can produce more than they can sell this means that it is usually in the interests of the producers to find new and broader retail outlets at any rate to concentrate on retail development is not to become hopelessly dependent upon producers if black people are watchful and well organized we can protect our interests maintain our independence and control our economic communities through selective buying and if need be boycotts this society is becoming increasingly conservative we black people must move on our own if we are to advance our relative position and improve our lives although some believe contrariwise it has yet to be proven that we cannot achieve our goals even within the framework of this far from perfect society if the day comes when other groups seek to openly block our advancement then we should man the barricades until that day comes we should continue to develop our potentialfor the surface has only been scratched in any event we must indeed keep the faith in ourselves in each other and in our groups capability and improvability black nationalism has been with us a long time and it is applicable to our present and future needs the point of view expressed here purports to be neither absolute nor final but it is hoped that pluralistic black nationalism will henceforth be at least one of the great debates back in feudal times when the lowly vassal was assigned some land his lord to make sure the underling got the message of how beholden he was required the poor guy to crouch stark naked fold his hands as though praying and intone the humble vassals oath while landlords have been obliged to scratch this requirement they have jealously kept intact other lordly rights in defiance of twentieth century tenancy reality feudal custom is firmly entrenched in todays landlordtenant law especially court opinion which is the chief formulator of tenancys powers and obligations many legal experts say this centuriesold hangup is the reason slums persistently stay with us undaunted by the frenzy of renewal and code enforcement and purported tenantrelief statutes they say further that this is why rent strikes have failed to bring relief except in new york city where a unique statute permits rent withholding under certain circumstances when a rent strike reaches the court stage the judge virtually always sides with the landlord tenant abuse persists according to this view because the rental housing consumerunlike all other modem consumersis not granted power to demand his due a group of talented lawyers across the country are making a concerted effort to remould tenantshackling court opinion and one of the most vigorous is james jim herndon a young negro lawyer who practices in san francisco herndons remoulding tools are wellprepared court cases for his thrust against entrenched injustice he seeks out instances of tenant abuse that while condoned by existing court opinion are nonetheless so manifestly wrong that a judge might be moved to agree herndon will travel anywhere in california to fight a good test case the courts have got to change says the lawyer judges still see renting as a conveyance like back in feudal times when lords assigned lands to their vassals for or years since vassals were basically sharecroppers the landlord had absolute right to the rent it represented a share of what issued from the land if rent wasnt paid the lords agents galloped in and took it naturally it was up to the vassal to maintain the place he mended the fieldstone walls and kept up the roads when the gale carried off the roof he rethatched but todays tenant isnt sharecropping his rent issues from his pocketbook and what he bargains for and pays for is habitable living quarters facilities and services all three yet he is forced to pay the full rent even if he gets just one of these purchasesthe space herndon points out that there is no defense for nonpayment of rent summary eviction proceedings dont permit so much as a mention of a landlords default only the tenants even if an apartment were flooded or roofless or firegutted if the tenant remains on the premises he has to pay the full rent says herndon all other purchasers of a deficient productsay a car with a defective transmission can demand restitution if you order a supply of liquor and get half empty boxes you dont have to pay for the empties do you judicial bias emasculates purported tenant relief statutes herndon claims several states have authorized the tenant to spend up to a months rent in some states two to make vital repairs if the landlord wont not only is the rent money insufficient to cover most vital repairs but worse the statutes fail to define what is vital the tenant who dares spend the rent for repairs finds himself in trouble if there is no lease the landlord retaliates by evicting the tenant if a lease exists the landlord goes to court and challenges the expenditure as unnecessary and judges generally side with landlords on this point it goes likewise with the principle of constructive eviction which courts recognize in theory but rarely in practice supposedly the tenant is free to break his lease and move if the premises become uninhabitable but the wise tenant knows better just what uninhabitable means no court has decided for certain the tenant who thinks he knows and accordingly moves finds himself hailed before a judge who by habit agrees with the land lord that the tenant was overfinicky as for housing code violations when a landlord is taken to court for a citation the judge lets him off with a few dollars fine or accepts his work permit as proof that hell correct the violation off the hook the landlord usually forgets about repairing theres a simple reason in herndons view why the landlordtenant transaction remains feudal tenants havent pled their case whereas landlords keep a legion of lawyers arguing in court to see that the law gets interpreted in their favor and the feudal way favors them those who use the law mould the law things wont change until tenants swing equal weight in court theyve got to seize the initiative aggressively defend themselves appeal landlord victories to higher courts initiate cases against landlords and fight hard to win only through this route will the rental contract become reciprocal herndon a slight handsome bachelor is a nighttime stealerinandout of drab tenant gatherings in drab settingsclusters of tiredlooking men and women under a naked light bulb in a housing project apartment or in the stark sunday school room of a slum church as familiar as his favorite jazz records are complaints of doors that wont lock toilets that wont flush drains that wont drain sometimes told in anger sometimes in tears while seeming to study his wellpolished shoes he listens for two types of situations first he detects pitfalls a tenant may be approachingsome trap that would propel him into a damage suit or even into jail while the landlord knows tenant law like the back of his hand tenant law to the average tenant is as tricky as a mine field yet slum tenants often make the leap from hopelessness to a heady assumption that because they have found company in their misery they can spit in the landlords eye to herndon falls the thankless task of throwing cold legal reality upon righteous indignation at one meeting anger was fizzing like a bicarbonate of soda a gaunt janitress whose earnings supported five children and a bedridden mother had just recounted how for months she had urged her landlord to repair a plumbing leak that soaked a wall of her mothers room after the mother became ill with pneumonia she decided to borrow with which she had the leak repaired and purchased materials for plastering and papering the wall herself instead of thanks she got a rent increase the landlord refused to accept the old rent she refused to pay more and now she was facing eviction the womans eyes snapped i pay my own way ill never take welfare but my pay wont stretch no further im not beat though when they come to evict us ill bar them with a shotgun my mother shouldnt be moved during this rainy season and shes not going to be herndon admired the womans spunk but he had to inform her that illness no matter how serious wouldnt stop a courtordered eviction and anyhow her mother could stand being moved in the rain better than seeing her daughter taken to jail but its robbery the woman cried im still paying off my repair loan shes right several voices chorused rip out that new plaster and wallpaper someone suggested all installations and improvements belong to the landlord herndon said with a sigh for the womans protection he persuaded her to submit but he felt angry at his profession which as propertys hireling had caused her desperation and he was angry at his helplessness to rescue her but sometimes there is a way one housing project council herndon advises staged a sitin to halt what it felt was an unfair eviction of a project family herndon theorized correctly that the city would not use force to remove sympathetic neighbors when the eviction crew arrived other project families literally packed the apartment sprawling over every bed every table the eviction crew left emptyhanded the same council successfully employed another unconventional protest method after the housing authority had refused to let them express grievances at an authority meeting the tenants barred exits at the end of the meeting and held board members captive for two startled hours forcing them to listen the tenants won several concessions but always herndon is listening for the makings of a good test case an instance of abuse that has a chance of winning relief in court such a victory is a wedgea precedent on which to build other cases he says unions and racial minorities have won significant rights through test cases that molded the law their way herndon hopes one day to persuade a judge to recognize that a rental agreement is a simple contract between buyer and seller for the use of space facilities and services the judge who admits this basic point herndon reasons would be obliged to admit the buyer need not pay for what he doesnt get the tenant who received only part of his purchase could demand restitution either a pro rata reduction of his rent or permission to withhold rent until he gets all he bargained for one of herndons most successful tenant cases occurred not in san francisco but in californias fruitgrowing region he acted as counsel for a rent strike in tulare county where migratoryworker families had struck to protest rent increases on dwellings they rented from the county the hikes werent muchfrom to but neither were the quarters by foot floorless corrugated sheds without facilities the federal government had given the camp to the county which had accumulated a surplus on it the rent strike was six months old when the county sued to evict the families herndon based his defense on evidence that if tenants paid for the sheds they would not be getting value received and also on a regulation which stated that raising rents required a new lease the judge quashed the eviction though leaning solely on the lease regulation in his opinion herndons insistence that any random day in court would bear out his appraisal of the judicial bias on tenancy led this reporter to drop by the san francisco small claims court one morning without checking the docket it was friday a light court day and in the court

as inexpensive collection machinery for merchants and landlords i listened to a succession of cases in which plaintiffs sought to collect owed bills and make good on bad checks but there was one customerinitiated case a comely matron successfully sued to recover for her unhappy purchase of a defective wig from her hairdresser then a bailiffs call brought before the judge a stylish blond an american indian and his slight wife who carried an infant and coaxed alongside three other small children the blond woman told the court that the family owed her a months rentthey had moved without giving the months notice or equivalent payment that california law says the tenant must m give the landlord before vacating they also owed for a broken window is this what happened the judge asked the couple in the informal manner of small claims proceedings yes the indian answered but we had reason he identified himself as an american seaman he said he had been flown home from the philippines for tuberculosis treatment to find his family without heat the bedroom ceiling leaking rain and the bathroom floor covered with water from a plumbing leak i moved the wife and kids onto dry land he said tersely the wife took up the thread in a weak voice she had repeatedly asked for repairs she said finally had called the health department a man had come out inspected and served the landlord an order to repair but no repairman came the children kept slipping down in the water and getting their clothes wet and the house was cold although brief the testimony touched on several points of law besides the requirement that tenants give a months notice both state and municipal statutes require the provision of heat and declare leaking roofs and leaking plumbing to constitute housing code violations then there is a court rule which theoretically permits tenants to move without obligation if the premises become uninhabitable the judges decision however was for the landlord the tenant was ordered to pay a months rent and the window assessment plus the court costs in higher courts the tenant finds himself even more handicapped herndon says in addition to judicial bias he and his neighborhood lawyer find themselves up against highlypaid council often a specialist in property cases these skilled men carefully plan their defenses to ward off court decisions unfavorable to landlordsdecisions that would set unwanted precedents it is against these affluent forces that herndon and his fellow crusaders have pitted themselves usually on a nonfee basis in the meantime until herndon and others persuade the courts to face modem tenant reality you may well find yourself in other positions even more uncomfortable the movement of black intellectuals toward total rejection of white control over the interpretation and evaluation of the forces and influences which shape black lives is inevitably sweeping some fellowtraveling black writers and leaders out of the way in the process it appears that ralph ellison surely one of the most gifted of american writers is rapidly losing his luster among black intellectuals even as he gains in glitter in the white establishment in a review of the book images of the negro in american literature published recently in freedomways ernest kaiser of the schomburg collection made the following very pertinent and perceptive assessment of the controversial mr ellison to ellison negro life in america is merely a part of the general human condition of western man to be mastered individually by each negro as a man he doesnt like the sociological description of the negroes struggles and suffering in the ghetto for he thinks that the sociological account reduces the negro and denies his humanity and cultural heritage but he is mistaken here the two go together they are not mutually exclusive at all following andre malraux the existentialists the disillusioned or clever opportunistic attackers of the left and the new critics who emphasize form as supreme even determining content ellison has become an establishment writer an uncle tom an attacker of the sociological formulations of the civil_rights movement a defender of the criminal vietnam war of extermination against the asian and american negro people a denigrator of the great tradition of negro protest writing and worst of all for himself as a creative artist a writer of weak and ineffectual fiction and essays mostly about himself and how he became an artist see the chapter from his forthcoming novel it always breaks out partisan review spring several pieces in shadow and act tell it like it is baby the nation september and the interviews of him an american novelist who sometimes teaches n y times magazine nov and a very stern discipline harpers march and ironically enough ellison has developed in this way and reached these conclusions at the very time when the negro peoples liberation struggle has reached new heights when writers like john o killens the late lorraine hansberry langston hughes ronald l fair margaret walker william melvin kelley james baldwin paule marshall ossie davis loften mitchell lerone bennett jr john henrik clarke and other negro writers have delineated in novels short stories plays and trenchant essays the negro peoples aspirations and heroic struggles every little bit helps the saying goes and it sometimes is amazing how much a very little can do take trading stamps for example they come as a bonus for buying food or furniture or gasoline or clothing and one can easily do without them in any event the individual collector must wait a very long time before the stamps can be traded for anything of substantial value on the other hand if a great many collectors send their small supply of stamps to a single collector then something of substantial value can be obtained well a branch of the students nonviolent coordinating committee is collecting trading stamps from donors all over the country to help the civil_rights organization equip offices and keep autos functioning says the chairman of the sncc stamp drive over the past couple of years we have been able to exchange the stamps for a great deal of the equipment which keeps our cars operational for our field workers among the things which we have acquired are electrical tirechanging apparatus several battery chargers analyzing machines an air meter a voltage regulator machine a wheel balancer and three falcon econoline buses this has been of invaluable service to us and our work all trading stamps are welcome however the preferred ones are the following s h green blue chip top value holden red and gold bond send the stamps to the title of arna bontemps and jack conroys book anyplace but here hill and wang is the punchline of a joke about some negro hoboes during the depression who flee a spot infested by a tough railroad detective the expression could equally well be attributed to the white denizens of cities to which negroes have migrated as the book is a record of the hardships and rejections negroes have suffered in their search for a better home anyplace but here is a reworking and a bringing up to date of they seek a city published in chapters are added on the watts chicago and harlem riots bringing events up to and the earlier chapters are rewritten parallel to the westward migration of the whites which negroes participated in as slaves scouts trappers cowboys cavalrymen and prospectors was the mass northward migration of negroes after the civil war the book tells of benjamin pap singleton who instigated the migration of negroes to kansas from the south after reconstruction singleton distributed circulars and chromos depicting prosperous conditions in kansas many negroes emigrated to kansas while others stopped in indiana and illinois or went farther west to colorado and california the book sketches the careers of many negroes of achievement among them jean baptiste point du sable founder of chicago jim beckwourth hunter trapper and scout william still a conductor in the underground railroad harriet tubman john jones prominent businessman and abolitionist of chicago the book documents the migration of negroes to chicago st louis detroit and new york during and after world war i and northward and westward after world war ii wherever negroes migrated they met opposition there were race riots in east st louis washington d c detroit chicago and other cities yet the negro has to assert his right to move and live freely wherever he desires even though it may involve living next to some very unpleasant neighbors by asserting his own rights he assures these rights to all i noticed two slight errors in the section about detroit which should be corrected in subsequent printings the street to which dr ossian sweet of the famous sweet case moved was not griswold but garland street griswold is a business street in downtown detroit belle isle park where the race riot of began is not a park on belle isle belle isle park is belle isledudley randall keep the faith baby is a book of sermons by the rev adam clayton powell published by trident press at the creativity of a clergyman is displayed in his sermon efforts the mark of authentic art is whether it clearly communicates the significant issues emerging from the contemporary scene unfortunately not many clergy have met this challenge however this is not the case with adam clayton powell this book of sermons spans his years as pastor of abyssinian baptist church they show that he is a watchman to his people in that he not only faithfully presents the hope of the christian faith but he does so by courageously couching this message within emerging issues of his time for this he is peculiarly well equipped since he is in the congress of this country he was aware of the world issues as they were emerging and to this information he creatively wove the significance of the hopes and aspirations of the black man in doing this he uniquely challenged the integrity of the united states as well as the courage of his constituents there is a timelessness about his sermons in that many of them speak to specific issues and yet they speak to the ongoing struggles of men everywhere for equality and justice he focuses the insights of the christian holy scriptures on the contemporary scene in the same way that an expert spotlight man does on the stage he believes that generalized preaching is nonbiblical and cites for his authority jesus who used specific parables as his main source of confrontation and teaching the upshot of this important work is that it symbolizes this inescapable fact which not enough people have realized that the saving element that can heal this society is the black man the black man for many reasons such as his perspective his sensitivity and circumstances is in the peculiar position to perform this important service for this culture as well as the world a quote from page bears this out what can the negro do to develop this civilization anew unless the american blacks can supply something that the sweep of the white mans civilization has omitted there can be no future world certainly no better world this the negro cannot supply until he refuses to drink any more of the poisons of this civilization adam clayton powell in this book claims to be the author of the phrase black_power he tells what he means by the phrase first of all black_power is not antiwhite black_power incorporates everybody who wishes to work together vote together and worship together is black_power white supremacy in reverse black_power makes no moral judgment but white supremacy does black_power simply reaffirms the integrity dignity and selfrespect of black people white supremacy denies them if white people can accept black leadership then i adam clayton powell welcome them this work provides an opportunity for many who have not observed the pastoral side of adam clayton powell to share his courageous and clear insights it is no wonder that many white clergymen now want to pastor black congregations for they realize that the true and challenging movements of god in our society are most clearly at work in the communities of the persecuted and oppressed though many folk doubt it we once had a childhood and we even wore plaits until people told us yearolds should

white man deserves to be complimented in that he has observed the negro carefully and reproduced the feelings of black people rather significantly the rev mr borders has the kind of wisdom that we can all learn from and this book is a minimum tribute to such a significant lifejames e woodruff jack olsen has written a book about cassius clay whom the world is begrudgingly beginning to recognize as muhammad ali black is best putnam is based on a fivepart profile of the world heavyweight boxing champion written for sports illustrated of which the author is senior editor it is in comparison with the treatment generally accorded to its subject by the press a generous and objective picture of an entertaining serious and contradictory man although not an authorized biography and a distinctly unfriendly one as far as alis muslim beliefs are concerned the champion simultaneously withheld his approval and promoted the book in much the same way as he can taunt and goad his opponents and exhibit a tender solicitude for their healthafter the fight clearly ali is something unprecedented in the sporting life he has rejected most of the stereotyped activities associated with champion status for a negro fighterhe doesnt drink smoke or chase white women he is in his own eccentric way articulate and his own publicist he has no obvious vices but he is immodest about his own excellence and is a muslim mr olsen is tolerant of the former but not the latter and undoubtedly feels that his muslim entourage increasingly removes him from reality and exploits his fame and his pocket with these prejudices which will certainly be shared by many of his readers mr olsen has nevertheless given us a reasonably full account of alis childhood of his parents and other relatives cassius clay sr might merit a book himself his coaches trainers and physicians and his brief marriage alis determination to be accessible to his people to the slum children who surround him in miami new york and chicago is a consistent and endearing factor among the many that make up his kaleidoscopic personality more attention indeed is devoted to alis personality than to his career as a fighter though an appendix lists opinions of various authorities fight promoters journalists other fighters of his standing in the ranks of championship holders he emerges as narcissistic ingenuous but shrewd mystical but practical given to wild flights of imagination and moments of sober truth but certainly neither charlatan nor fool brenda m biram i the race war the viking press by ronald segal is a book that every american should read although white ronald segal has surveyed history from the perspective of a nonwhite his thesis is that the world is divided into two groups those who have and those who have not it is apparent that those with the economic advantage are white and those without it are nonwhite in its frenzy to keep its highly profitable economic advantage throughout the world the west has taken a stand against any and all revolutions that promise to liberate the poor from the oppression of poverty the united states leads the west in spreading and defending the democracy of privilege as a result the united states threatens to weld the forces of race and desperate poverty into one mr segals survey of history explodes many of our humanitarian and democratic myths often the united states has used these myths to justify its foreign policy and international involvements mr segal reveals the united states as something much less than the white knighthenceforth an expensive and dangerous deceit in about a hundred pages mr segal strides through years of african history naturally much is omitted yet much more is said about subsahara history than is usually found in histories dealing with this oftenblack world the ancient kingdoms of kush ghana mali and songhai were not pocket kingdoms they covered vast areas included considerable populations and depended upon a complex administration yes africa has had a grand splendid history mr segals analysis of todays africa should be read by every western diplomat and molder of governmental policy he observes that the truth is that it is not neutralism or socialism that the west distrusts as much as independence mr segal sees south america as another continent ready to erupt into revolution he concludes that any country where the majority of the people are poor and starving is ripe for revolution and in south america the small ruling class is white the havenots are nonwhite in too many places in the world oppression and indifference to poverty and suffering have become identified with whites mr segals history of south america and his analysis of south americas present economic and social ills lead to the conclusion that the small ruling class in these countries to the south have already done much to unite the pain of poverty with color mr segals criticisms of the united states and russia find both countries guilty of racism and fated to be in opposition to future revolutions which may upset the existing racial and economic power structure regarding britain it is inconceivable that a nation that has spent over years dominating colored people bouncing in and out of foreign lands and exacting tribute at whim would restrict the flow of colored people to her shores she has though and britains handling of southern rhodesia has not been lost on the african world russias treatment of african students studying within her boundaries has not endeared them to her explanations other than race have been given for this sometimes brutal treatment only time will tell whether this virulent madness has taken root in russia too the united states history of racism and brutality is carefully surveyed little needs to be said on this score we are familiar with the role our country has played and is still playing in the whiteblack showdown on the other hand china has several advantages over the west she is a colored nation she has risen and will continue to rise from backward circumstances similar to many emerging nations and she has been ruthlessly exploited by the west britain forced opium on china in as a medium of trade china fought to preserve her dignity and integrity she lost the opium war she also lost the boxer rebellion at the beginning of the twentieth century as a consequence she was economically and territorially ravished by britain and the united states russia has been slow to respond to the need of the chinese communists she has given them little support china represents to the colored world a hope and a way to independence more importantly chinas victory over the west regardless of the area gives the colored nations a boost in morale for here is a colored nation giving the whites what so many feel is their just due again every american should read this book whether you accept mr segals premise does not matter you however will be brought face to face with vital issues which may decide your fate you will be exposed to these issues from a nonwhite perspective this point of view may be of crucial importance to all of us to your surprise you will find many feelings and suspicions raised to a conscious historical level that alone is enough to make this book worthwhileronald williams the reader of john beechers to live and die in dixie red mountain editions is surprised to see poems like in egypt land coming from a white writer in alabama but the surprise vanishes when he reads commemoration ode and learns that the poet is the greatgrandnephew of henry ward beecher and harriet beecher stowe in egypt land is a long narrative poem about sharecroppers trying to organize its looserhythmed unrimed lines and plain vocabulary studded with the homely phrases of the negro characters hold the interest like a good short story in the section to live and die in dixie there are poems about race relations written from the point of view of whites our gang laid for the kids from niggertown wed whoop from ambush chunking flints and see pale soles of black feet scampering more fun than birds to chunk at birds were too hard to hit in the section bestride the narrow world which extends the horizons he has the same deadpan matteroffactness in a veterans day of recollection he says wed liberated naples and the wops had come aboard to work cargo this starving spik slipped a can of rations underneath his lousy rags we drilled him john beecher is classical in his simple directness there are no ornament no tricks his power depends on the force of what he has to say and the arrangement and interrelationships of the parts there is danger of flatness and sometimes of turgidity in this way of writing but at his best he is plain and powerful hearing no protests and seeing no pickets j yale university press v has published a paperback revised edition of robert a bones the negro novel in america now too late to prevent publication but perhaps in time to caution readers avidly seeking to learn about the artistic contributions of negroes it is necessary to point out the shortcomings the fallacies and the biases which vitiate mr bones commendable effort to evaluate negro writers novels according to literary criteria although i must become caustic i write with regret for such a book is needed and mr bone frequently demonstrates both the requisite critical acuteness and the literary talent to write perceptively and engagingly unfortunately not content to confine himself to the role of critic and historian of individual writers he has presumed to serve as psychiatrist philosopher and teacher not only for all negro writers but for all negroes forgetting his own admonition that extraordinary experience with another race is required of a writer who wishes to write perceptively of that race p he has set forth a creed for the negro writer and intellectual and he has defended that creed by errors of fact and inference inconsistencies and contradictions supercilious lectures and flippant remarks often in bad taste the characteristic weaknesses appear in the first two paragraphs of the introduction the advocates of naive brotherhood will object in advance to the notion of a negro novel they will deny usually without having read them that novels written by american negroes differ significantly from novels written by other americans to this line of argument the classic rebuttal has been advanced by j saunders redding season it as you will he writes the thought that the negro american is different from other americans is still unpalatable to most negroes nevertheless he continues the negro is different an iron ring of historical circumstance has made him so as if to restore the balance he adds but the difference is of little depth with this balanced view i agree it is a serious mistake to gloss over or ignore strong cultural differences in order to speed the process of integration pp bone covers an amazing amount of ground he intends to persuade the advocates of naive brotherhood that a negro novel exists first therefore his audience becomes indefinite i know what is meant by the phrase naive advocates of brotherhood but i do not know what is meant by naive brotherhood second bone seems determined to tilt with don quixotes giants few if any people question the fact that negro novels have been written the more critical issue is whether all novels written by american negroes differ significantly from novels written by other americans in such a way that a reader can determine the difference the impossibility of ever proving this statement is easily evidenced by the mistakes which have been made in identifying the racial origins of nonnegroes who have written about white people readers ignorant of the race of henrietta buckmaster or frank yerby do not instinctively recognize the truth but bone wanted to prove that there is a significant difference and in the age of madison avenue advertising he chose to prove it by testimony from one who should knowa negro writer bones misuse of saunders reddings words should provide teachers of freshman composition with at least one lecture on propaganda devices redding says that most negroes do not like to think that they are different from other americans but because of historical circumstances they have a difference which is of little depth to bone this proves strong cultural differences which produce a readily identifiable negro novel even this triumph is not enough for bone who jumps from a literary question not solved to a social question not asked as he advises the reader not to ignore the strong differences in order to speed the process of integration the literary critic has become the social teacher these two paragraphs are a microcosm of the work the remainder of the introduction is similarly marred the dominant thesis is that as a minority group stripped denuded is bones word of its native culture the negro in america has been sundered in a psychic tugofwar between assimilationism and negro nationalism wishing to be white he has repulsed lowerclass members of his race while he has aped the mannerisms of middleclass white people cognizant that he is restricted within the dominant culture he has militantly marshaled his hatred against the white majority while he has aggrandized the minor successes of his own race assimilationism and negro nationalism concepts indispensable to understanding the cultural history of the american negro are employed throughout the work not only in interpreting the consciousness of individual authors but in gauging the temper of whole periods they provide a fixed point of reference from which to view the changing attitudes of the negro novelistattitudes which are often fundamental to the content of his art p this framework he says will provide analytical tools for studying the cultural history of the ethnic minority the american negro historians like benjamin quarles would argue that mr bones onesentence stripping of african culture from the american negro is a dubious oversimplification by failing to adopt a similar framework for analyzing the work of writers of the irish renaissance or jewish writers in america literary historians seem to distrust bones approach the major objection however is bones continuing to quote such respected writers as redding wright and ellison to verify conclusions which would be accepted without argument by a negro at least while he postulates as incontrovertible other theories which he has established by dexterous implication fallacious inference and wit for instance i would not dispute that if one wishes to simplify one may study the history of any minority groupfrom the hebrews in an egyptian society to the presentin terms of the attempt of that group to become part of or to rebel against the dominant culture but that fact does not justify the implication that a negro is hypocritical or assimilationistic if he likes beethovens music attends a staid episcopalian rather than a shouting baptist church and develops a patriarchal family structure p the implication itself reveals the essential weakness in mr bones thought having a preconceived image of the negro and of the lives of negroes he defends those writers who support his image and attacks those who create contrary images although he admonishes scholars who attempt to base literary judgments on social bases p too soon he lies in the pit against which he warned it is tempting but impossible in a paper of this length to refute mr bone point by point to call attention to all the errors of fact for many of which i would excuse him knowing the difficulty of dredging out some of the information to cite the many fallacious and inexcusable inferences and to note the instances in which the zest for turning a phrase has created a breach of good taste for the sake of illustration however i must discuss some of the more glaring the work is structured in six parts part i the novel of the rising middle class part ii the discovery of the folk part iii the search for a tradition part iv the revolt against protest a postscript an essay on james baldwin which constitutes the only new material in the revised edition and an epilogue advice to negro writers parts iii and iv and the postscript have value as has the bibliography the book would be better if the other sections had not been written the poorest of the historiliterary sections is part i aggrieved by what he believes to be deplorable assimilationism by the negro middleclass and contemptuous of the popular literary traditions before bone devotes considerable verbiage to an attack on both but principally the middleclass he begins his attack with a spurious history of the rise of the middleclass the historical origins of the negro middleclass can be traced back to the nocturnal escapades of countless male aristocrats who tried valiantly to wash a race whiter than snow p less offensive than the tasteless facetiousness is the amusing fact that despite his contempt for the negro writers who echoed the plantation tradition bone himself accepted one of the cardinal myths by implying that the south was populated only by aristocrats ignoring such darkskinned house servants as paul laurence dunbars mother he continues his myth by asserting that the house servants were mulatto children of the master who after the civil war naturally turned for assistance to the southern democrats who were their kin therefore they wrote novels addressed to their white folks reluctant to abandon the benefits of paternalism they still hoped to solve the problem of the color line within the family both branches p since bone is vague about the identity of the early novelists it is difficult to refute him specifically one mentioned in the chapter however is charles w chesnutt who certainly did not believe that he was addressing his novels to his white kinfolk the middleclass next appears bone states under the guise of the talented tenth a term which is the italics are bones used synonymously with negro middleclass p bones ambiguous phrasing makes it impossible to determine whether he is explaining that he wilfully uses it as a synonym or whether he mistakenly assumed that w e b du bois considered it a synonym needless to say du bois had too keen a sense of figures to have any difficulty distinguishing between the upper intellectual tenth of any group and the middle socioeconomic section of that same group for bone however talented tenth equals middleclass equals assimilationist bone reprimands this talented tenth group of early novelists one must assume that he includes all novelists before for adopting the horatio alger success formula and for attempting to inculcate middleclass morality into their readers he concludes his reprimand with the dramatically irrelevant allegation that the early negro novelist had the soul of a shopkeeper p a note reminiscent of some diatribes about the butcher boy of stratford this is not bones only grievance against the early novelists assuming that we are inclined to assume that this early protest literature was based on a catholic concern for the brotherhood of man p an assumption never made by a negro literary historian he hastens to point out that the early novelists were prejudiced against jews immigrants and nonwhites p even worse they sometimes betrayed their own race as when chesnutts protagonist protested his unwillingness to sit beside a group of negro farm hands here bone repeats the moral judgment uttered by liberals and by negroes themselves the negro should not be a snob any member of another group may despise the less talented less strong less intelligent less wealthy less healthy members of his group but the negro must love his fellowman worst of all bone continues the desire to assimilate caused the talented tenth to imitate outworn literary traditions of romanticism and melodrama rather than to recognize that american literature of the future would be that emulating the realism and naturalism and the styles of twain garland howells dreiser norris and james this is certainly the only instance in which a literary historian has found in social aspirations an explanation of the literary style of not one but an entire group of writers harassed by bones allegations and inconsistencies the early negro novelist has no chance for respectability if like chesnutt he realistically expressed the attitudes of negroes he is chastized for lacking a brotherly spirit if he wrote a horatio alger story he is derided as an assimilationist the obvious implication is that success stories should have been written only by white authors for white readers for the negro should never have expected such success but that is exactly the attitude stated in one mans fortune by paul laurence dunbar whom bone denounces as an archassimilationist if the early novelist wrote in the melodramatic tradition of his time he is castigated for lacking the perceptivity missing equally from hundreds of nonnegro novelists who were writing the same kind of melodrama in the second chapter bone finally identifies the talented tenth novelists and a motley group they are whereas bone distinguished the writing of twain from that of howells and henry james he gathers into a single group the following diverse personalities paul laurence dunbar a provincial high school educated ohioborn and reared darkskinned youth who distrusted mulattoes and considered prose inferior to poetry charles waddell chesnutt a talented shortstory writer born in ohio but reared in north carolina sensitive to the problems of lightcolored negroes outspoken and determined to carve his fortune w e b du bois of massachusetts aristocratically proud of his ancestry educated as a scholar arrogant and militant a talented essayist who sometimes collected his essays as history and sometimes as novels and james weldon johnson cosmopolite from florida trained in education and in law attuned to the theatrical world of new york and to the diplomatic world of washington never has there been such a bundling under a single blanket since the bees flew in with aunt matilda to enforce the nonexistent unity bone digs out surprising similarities chesnutt and dunbar both wrote their first stories in the plantation tradition in the case of chesnutt this refers to the fact that his first published collection of tales focused on uncle julius a shrewd southern negro who to advance his own ends tells his northern employer tales based on the folk superstitions of negroes in north carolina unlike the typical stories of the plantation tradition they do not glorify the antebellum south as bone knew or should have known chesnutt once protested that he would not write about negroes contented with peonage under their exmasters even though he knew such negroes existed to identify chesnutt with the plantation tradition is therefore akin to describing guy de maupassant as a pastoral writer because he wrote about rural people furthermore bone asserts chesnutt and dunbar had white literary patronswalter hines page and william dean howells respectively the term patron insults all four men for it implies support far beyond that given or received page it is true was the first editor to accept chesnutts stories but the decision to publish the first collection of chesnutts stories and his novels required authority which page lacked the relationship of howells to dunbar is even more tenuous howells introduced the poetry of dunbar to national attention by writing a favorable review of majors and minors and by writing an introduction to lyrics of lowly life if these acts define a patron then baudelaire was a patron of edgar allan poe actually dunbar unlike chesnutt did have white patrons but they were far less eminent than howells injudicious appraisals mar the attention which bone gives to these writers as individuals although he magnanimously contends that extenuating circumstances motivated dunbars uncle tom behavior he writes whenever dunbar had something to say which transcended the boundaries of the plantation tradition he resorted to the subterfuge of employing white characters rather than attempting a serious literary portrait of the negro p obviously mr bone failed to read the strength of gideon and other stories bone sees in the relationship of bles and zora in the silver fleece du boiss unconscious allegory of his attempt to embrace the negro masses an action which he can undertake only if zora re deems herself it is scarcely necessary to point out that in american novels of one rarely finds heroes being wed to unredeemed or even to slightly stained heroines were all these writers revealing their unconscious antipathy for the masses or is such biographical symbolism to be exercised only in reading novels written by negroes bone describes du boiss diction as a schizophrenic clash of thcentury intellectual veneer against thcentury idiom p du boiss new meanings strain against the old idiom but it will not yield when mark twain observed that james fenimore cooper wrote dialogue badly he explained that cooper wrote it badly because he did not listen to the way that people talk or did not have occasion to talk with characters of the type about whom he wrote but twain considered himself a judge of literature not a psychiatrist bones comments on james weldon johnson reveal his inconsistency andif i may be forgiven for adopting his critical approach reveal the subliminal tension between his aesthetic judgments and his social biases pleased with the artistic merits of the autobiography of an excoloured man and with johnsons defense of ragtime and the cakewalk bone treats lightly the fact that johnsons protagonist has higher aspirations the lowlife milieu of the harlem school is hardly his johnsons natural habitat p a less competent novelist would have been condemned as assimilationist for implying that there are higher aspirations part iithe discussion of the renaissanceis markedly superior to the first but weakens eventually from bones stubborn effort to fit all the writings into the framework of assimilationism versus negro nationalism to indicate his approval of the talented rebels of the renaissance bone describes them as the intelligensia a term unfortunately more restrictive and less appropriate than talented tenth which he continues to use as a cudgel against the middleclass before he ends his introduction however bone dumps the intelligensia into the camp of harlem nationalists at war with the talented tenthmiddleclass advocates of the genteel tradition even in his discussion of the harlem school mr bones biases govern his aesthetic judgments he condemns the early novelists because they revealed their contempt for the masses by introducing in their works characters resembling those of the minstrel shows he praises the harlem writers for daring to create characters who run dangerously close to the stereotype p and he continues to reveal unconsciously the limitations in his knowledge of negro life limitations which affect both his social theories and his interpretations of the works for instance he writes in the early negro novel a professor was a school teacher inflated achievement in the harlem school novel a professor is strictly the third party to a rickety piano and a precarious glass of beer p but one familiar with idiom of the south knows that well into the forties fessuh was the generic title for all male teachers a novelist failing to use the term would have violated the idiom which bone wishes to protect it is difficult not to suspect that bone praises the harlem writers not merely because they are competent craftsmen but because despite occasional extravagances they more honestly reveal the negro as bone believes him to be bone for instance examines claude mckays characters as symbols whereas he derides the characters of the early novelists as counterstereotypes or minstrels his chief criticism of home to harlem and banjo is that ray mckays spokesman is too intellectual to permit mckay to renounce anglosaxon civilization as emphatically as bone expects he extols mckays achievement in banana bottom in which bita the protagonist marrying jubban embraces the beauty of peasant life similarly although bone mentions the structural defects of langston hughes not without laughter his principal criticism is that by sending the protagonist back to school hughes contradicts his major themethat negroes cultivate the spirit of joy because achievement is largely illusory for them since bone finds no ambivalence or inconsistency in hughes attitudes towards racial matters in other works one wonders whether hughes did not say exactly what he desiredthat the negro must embrace joy and seek success perhaps it is merely bone who believes that one cannot exist in company with the other bones eloquent praise of jean toomer compensates for the fact that almost all of the biographical information is inexact toomers parents were not cultivated negroes of creole stock at least toomer never assumed that his georgiaborn father was the household tradition of tales of slavery exists factually only in bones imagination in fact toomer was eighteen before he became fully aware of the dramatic role which his grandfather p b s pinchback had played in the reconstruction toomer did not study law he did not turn to literature as quickly as bone implies but he did undertake a brief literary apprenticeship in cosmopolitan new york it is ironic that toomer whom he praises for having never underestimated the importance of his negro identity p should have been the very one to proclaim loudest the statement which bone ridicules as the selfdeluding myth of the assimilationist i am not a negro i am an american on this issue of which he must have been aware bone is silent although bone cannot be blamed for wanting to discuss toomer cane is not a novel neither toomer nor the liveright publishers considered it such bones other errors in interpreting cane result merely from his excusable ignorance of the man and his other writings the errors however illustrate the danger of building a man a philosophy and a myth upon the subjective reading of one literary work in the final chapter of part ii the hapless middleclass become spokesman of negro philistia principally because of their attacks on the harlem artists in this chapter more perhaps than in any other bone suffers a colorblindness which prevents his recognizing that du boiss objections to subject matter of novels and benjamin brawleys objections to jazz do not reflect racial posture but artistic standards it is difficult to draw a significant racial distinction between w d howells attack upon russian naturalistic novels and du boiss disgust with what he believed to be the filth of home to harlem similarly englishteacher brawleys criticism of the grammar of the lyrics of jazz is echoed today by many nonnegro critics of rock and roll but subconsciously believing that all worthy negroes should possess identical artistic standards bone flails them with arguments sometimes supported by misused quotations james weldon johnson whose instinct was always sound in such matters vigorously defended the lowerclass negro as higher literary material it takes nothing less than supreme genius he once remarked to make middleclass society black or white interestingto say nothing of making it dramatic p johnson says nothing here about higher literary material whatever that may be he says that it is hard to write dramatically about middleclass people if he implies that it is therefore easier to write about lowerclass people he implies equally that it is easier to write about upperclass people such a blatant misuse of a source is as reprehensible as is the laudatory statement on the back cover of the negro novel in america which implies endorsement by the cla journal when in fact the quotation was taken from an article in the journal not even from a review suffering most in the chapter is jessie fauset who was never able to transcend the narrow limits of her sheltered background p granted that miss fausets novels do not please surely the cause must be more than the kind of family background which edith wharton used advantageously miss fausets literary sin is not her failure to rebel against the kind of family which bone implies a negro ought not to have her sins are a diction which was outmoded by and an inability to structure a plot effectively but bone ignores these artistic weaknesses to concern himself only with her family and her literary intentions even though he averred in the beginning that he would always establish the work of art in its own right before viewing it as part of the cultural process p in part iii bone insists less on the struggle between assimilationism and nationalism it is just as well for some of the novelists he must discuss demonstrate a basic weakness of bones thesisit fails to consider that the writer by the very fact of his publishing is becoming a part of the dominant culture regardless of the thesis he expresses in his work in his private life arna bontemps surely must represent the middleclass negroes or the talented tenth who have adopted or have inherited the values identified with white middleclass americans of the protestant ethnic group and who by bones definition are assimilationist yet bontemps novel which bone praises most highly is black thunder which bone believes is marred primarily by excessive race pride ie negro nationalism commendably bone calls attention to george henderson and william attaway whose novels should be better known while discussing these and richard wright he demonstrates that he has competence when he restricts himself to literary judgments zora neale hurston benefits from bones appraisal which points to the virtues of her work and minimizes her exploitation of the exotic in the speech and habits of negroes her caricaturing of negroes whose philosophies differed from hers her acceptance of the caste philosophy characteristic of the plantation tradition and her focus upon the atypical culture of eatonville florida as might be expected he judges harshly seraph on the suwanee which lacks the exotic charm of her earlier novels about negroes curiously he ignores moses man of the mountain which is perhaps miss hurstons most delightful work part iv challenged bone because for the first time he was forced to discuss a number of novelists who wrote nonnegro novels he met the challenge by dismissing frank yerby as the prince of pulpsters an allegation irrelevant to his thesis that novels by negroes must be significantly different and by defining as assimilationist such writers as richard wright chester himes zora neale hurston and ann petry when they wrote about white protagonists in parts iv and v he reveals his best work judging ellison and baldwin who lend themselves to mythic or symbolic interpretation he can propound explications which are provocative even if they do not always reflect the artists intentions near the conclusion of his book bone states the truth which should have dissuaded him from the thesis upon which he based literary as well as social judgments little remains to be said of these novelists as a group for like all real artists their work is highly individualistic p having reached this understanding he can merely vacillate in the advice he offers negro novelists in a postscript the negro novelist should not sacrifice his art to the nonliterary attempt to correct social injustices let the negro novelist as citizen as political man vent his fury and indignation through the appropriate protest organizations but as novelist as artist let him pursue his vision his power of seeing and revealing which is mankinds rarest gift p absorbed with the beauty of his phrases bone fails to observe that if mans rare gift makes him see injustice then artistic integrity requires him to reveal it this will be called protestif it is ineptly writtenfurthermore bone continues the negro writer should not seek to evade writing about the ghetto because if he does then it will lack an interpreter p as soon as one judges art by adding the historical dimension bone states one realizes that the novelist is not free to deal with negro life when he does not write about the ghetto p thus bone finally unmasks to reveal himself as one of those whom he cited richard gibson as castigatingthe professional liberal who reminds the negro writer that he cannot possibly know anything else but jim crow sharecropping slum ghettoes georgia crackers p bone concludes his advice with the reminder that although the negro novelist can write about anything he knows his early novel should be about negroes because most negro novelists will produce only one or two novels p he knows this to be a fact because most negro novelists have produced only one or two novels in the beginning was mr bone s assertion of the need for a book which evaluated negro writers novels according to artistic standards if mr bone had limited himself to that task he would have succeeded despite his predilection for works lending themselves to mythic interpretation as a cultural historian or as a psychiatrist of the mentalities of millions of negroes however he is less than adequate today i saw an old t v man counting his steps several minutes passed before i realized that both of us were trying to cross the street and by that time a tall skinny lady in a chemise coat rushed up and grabbed his arm she talked to him for a moment he shook his head then she pulled him across the street holding up her hand to the approaching cars while he waved his faded red and white cane in a wide circular motion i followed keeping a measured distance behind when they reached the other side of the street she leaned over and whispered to him he nodded his head again and drooled on his faded gray jacket in an apparent attempt to smile she shook her head at me and another lady who had stopped to stare and then walked away with her head held ridiculously high he stood there for a moment tapping on the ground with his cane the way all old blind men with canes do acting as if they can send out morse code messages to the sidewalk to roll them to the places they want to go he stepped stopped stepped again and i saw that he was probably going to bump into the apartment building on the comer if someone didnt help him i stood there feeling stupid for watching and wondering why i was there at all another lady who happened to be passing by cautiously approached him asked a few questions and led him away looking at me with what i felt to be utter contempt i immediately felt ashamed on the way home i could not forget the mans face then i thought of simon for the first time in ten years simon always looked as if he had been dipped in grease and had then allowed some freestyle sculptorer to carve dirt into every line of his cinnamoncolored face and his patched beige suit his clothes hung from every limb and he resembled the pictures you sometimes see around halloween of masquerading skeletons at precisely six oclock every evening he would stop in front of my house head bowed body bent as if at any moment he expected numerous blows from behind a copper cup holding a pebble tied by a grime and grease smeared handkerchief to a faded red and white cane in one hand and a rustinfected cow bell in the other would literally ring me out of my chores to lead him home most of the time i arrived panting from what i laughingly called my fast getaway for although i expected him everyday at six i was always afraid that one day he would not make it during the two years he stopped at my house though i asked him many times he never told me how he got there and i never worried enough to find out here i am i would say and his cautious old hound would whine and lick my hand the old mans owlish eyes would roll around in their sockets in a useless attempt to focus on me i imagine we were an interesting looking couple a thin brown girl with legs and arms too long for anything except leaping and hugging with rulerlength hair the color and texture of a boar bristle brush m i i i would lead him past dingy usedfurniture stores with cracked windows past oneroom churches where even at that time of day holy rollers were holding services and some lay twisting on the floor shouting while others hung out the doors praying for a breeze eyeing the parade of condemned nonchalant sinners outside past heat french names like la boutique and singed hair dresser shops with chateau coiffures where sweating hairdressers shared their space with americanstyled primebred fat and greasy rats and roaches that looked as if shampoo cremes and hair pomades were the healthiest diets in the world past maggotpacked restaurants with loud juke boxes which always seemed to be playing billie holiday records on and on until finally we would come to the alley where simon disappeared and i was sure he lived i never took him more than halfway into the garbagestaled urinedrenched alley i would watch him for a few minutes and then run out of that alley like a whipdriven horse leaving simon with the odors that invariably threatened my stomach the walk home was mine and treasured it more than my first pair of high heel shoes and silk stockings i thought of myself as an angel or undiscovered saint for at least ten minutes of the walk home i would remember how i had forced myself to walk slowly with simon instead of pulling him along behind me i could almost hear this or that neighbor saying isnt mattie a dignified child wearing pants all the time didnt count see how she takes time with old simon i wish my betty was more like her you never see mattie running after boys yelling and switching up the streets in fact you hardly see the sweet thing at all nellie wont have any trouble next year when the child goes to high school i would smile and think of how my mother would answer these comments well matties a perfect little lady now and has been since her twelfth birthday this june i told her then that when a girl makes that age she has to act different she has to stop talking so loud and popping gum and help me around the house more shes a little lazy but i dont have any real trouble with her thank the lord i didnt notice that i was acting any differently i never could pop gum or talk loud and i had always had to do housework since mama had worked for as long as i could remember nevertheless these thoughts would please me and almost push a nagging guilt out of my mind for whenever i saw simon for some reason or another i thought of mrs petrie mrs petrie lived next door and had arthritis her legs looked like swollen bowling pins and she never went anywhere she and her cigarsucking husband had lived in their stuffed musty apartment for as long as i could remember and she had always had arthritis he had always chewed or sucked an unlit halfsmoked cigar it could have been the same one for all i know because i never saw him smoking anyhow mother would make me go and sit with mrs petrie and read the bible and as soon as i was old enough to go to the store alone i had to run errands for her she was a kind woman and would always smooth my braids down they always stuck out at that time and tell me what a pretty thin face i had it was from mrs petrie that i learned how my full lips and large eyes would one day be my best assets i would sit quietly on her broken down hassock while she adjusted her glasses and she would either hum church hymns or talk in a broken creole dialect maddee you must neber poot dat powda on you smooth putti face i never tired of her talk her compliments were like my favorite chocolates almost too sweet to eat so that long after they had been digested the sweet flavor lagged behind to tease my mouth the family joke was how very much i ate and how skinny i grew working at digesting it as time passed however i grew restless because i always felt guilty and sometimes my manner with mrs petrie was painfully abrupt mrs petrie would send me to the grocery store every saturday and i would buy the petries food for the week after the first month i figured it out mr petrie never went past the comer and from there no grocery store was in sight in that household newspapers didnt exist mrs petrie certainly didnt know the cost of foods so i learned to cheat them first it was dimes later it was quarters and finally i managed to cheat them out of two and three dollars at a time of course they always paid me for shopping but somehow cents never seemed like much for standing in saturday morning grocery lines fighting women with babies and shopping carts and badtempered food checkers i always felt guilty but i never felt guilty enough to stop extra money was unheard of in my house daddy barely made enough for necessities when i saw him and that wasnt often since he worked two jobs and slept when he was at home he never had any moneyor so he said mother was different she was thrifty she saved everything and it was useless to ask for anything other than that which could be proven to be needed but i managed and did so with a fair amount of ease i was smart enough not to splurge and buy anything expensive which could be used as evidence such as records books or puzzles these things i loved in those days i consumed a lot of sodas and malts miraculously my figure and skin never showed it mrs petrie always said that the williams girl must be the most wellmannered trustworthy child on the block and how she loved church i did not love church i could not go anywhere else when i was allowed outside to play i could not cross the street because mama said the children were too bad betty and joyce werent ladies and the boys pitched pennies i did not have a bicycle and definitely could not play hide and seek with the other girls and boys mother said that since i was lefthanded i owed the devil a days work and he was not going to collect it if she had anything to do with it so to church i went so i could get saved and cheat the devil out of his due on sundays i went to sunday school at in the morning i doddled through oclock service and evening vespers on tuesdays thursdays and fridays i went to the btu the btu was baptist training union for all young christians desirous of being saved mother said that rev metcalfe was sure to put plenty of holy things on my mind and she was partially right he put plenty on my mind he would pace in his pulpit roaring and stomping his feet calling for all sinners to come forth and repent although everyone at the btu except ancient church stewards was sent by his parents and was truly desirous of being saved so he could die and go to heaven and lie in the arms of jesus and drink milk mixed with honey for ever and ever and yet every sunday evening at rev metcalfe opened the doors of the church and proceeded to eloquently beg the sinners to come forth confess and repent you know who you are he would shout jesus knows who you are let not your hearts be troubled anymore let jesus take your burdens repent repent truly the lord knows your heart at precisely this point he always made the same speech the tears would begin to slide down my cheeks and i would feel like i was coming down with the flu or catching hay fever the steward who strutted back and forth in front of the congregation in her stiff nurses uniform thats what all the stewardesses wore head bobbed and bent arms folded shouting my my my everytime the preacher made a point would rush over and pat me on the shoulder and everyone except my mother and cousins would think i had been moved or touched by the spirit the stewardess whose name was bessie would assure me that the lord knew my heart and that would make me cry even more because that meant he knew i was thinking bad thoughts and feeling very guilty about mrs petrie now that i think about it my thoughts werent bad i did not always think about boys and when i did there was usually one in particular all i wanted to do was play hide and seek with the boys jump rope ride bicycles and cross the street to play with the bad kids but mrs petrie and simon were my playmates and now some ten years later i find myself feeling guilty about some old man i dont even know and thinking about simon and wondering what mrs petrie would say if she could see my short hair and still thin but powdered face my painted lips and short skirts and wondering why when we moved to a new house and clean neighborhood the year i was i never went back not even once to visit in the years that followed and wondering why i was wondering about any of it at all what was wrong with me why had i stood there like that and foolishly watched the man struggle why hadnt i helped him but thousands of blind people lived in the world and for every one of them there were people who could see and would help why should i have been the one let the other nine do it i never could understand why i could cross five main streets to lead simon home and cross two main streets to go and buy groceries for mrs petrie yet never cross one little street to play with those other children mother had said that that was different it was she suddenly said no knew that that was what she meant qji a no what his voice already seemed further away quite distant why no dont come up but his voice was rising with that chafing that she had come to know perhaps too well im downstairs at the reception desk no she insisted as a matter of fact go home im going to bed youre not well he said im coming up youd better not coolly slipping out of the satin pumps that caused her considerable discomfort i might have you arrested for molesting me and she carefully replaced the receiver in its cradle expecting it to ring immediately afterward but when after three or four minutes it still had not rung she lifted the receiver waiting for the operator to respond alio oui the abrupt precise sound of the operators voice irritated her even more than an american counterparts for there was something pressing urgent in the little intake of breath terminating the salutation something insisted intimidatingly that all responses be in french well she wasnt having any she was through with her useful words and phrases shed used them all up id like to have a menu brought up please in very concise english but i can repeat the dinner menus to you madame if you like the voice assured her really quite cheerfully quite pleased and in excellent english in spite of a previous determination to be difficult she melted smiling oh would you the menus were repeated with added suggestion that the blanquette de veau was exceptionally good the voice had had it for dinner and it had been delicious recalling that blanquette de veau was one of the things shed learned to adore within a few scant days in france she ordered that along with a bottle of rose incidentally miss if anyone should call would you please say that i am not in i want to get to sleep as early as possible without being disturbed of course madame would that be all the voice retained throughout its pitch of impersonal though friendly concern and she was touched yes except i wonder if there isnt a travel agency near the hotel the hotel can handle all travel arrangements for you if you wish oh yes she remembered the thoughtfulness and service made one feel like staying and staying but she had made up her mind id like a reservation on the earliest possible flight to new york she said satisfied that now it was in motion it was being done by tomorrow night at the latest she would be home in her own little flat telephoning addie dishing all the dirt a voyage to paris had not been among her plans for the future so it seemed incongruous that she should find herself there now one day as it were she had taken a stroll down fifth avenue and suddenly found herself peering inquisitively through the window of the french national tourist bureau without hesitating she had entered got herself engaged in pleasant conversation with a charming woman and left the office nearly an hour later a little stack of convincing brochures clutched in a gloved hand then she had stopped in at doubledays and brought one of those useful words and phrases albums and gone straight home feeling that this indeed might be the year it occurred to her that she hadnt been saving all that money for a vacation that in some psychological improbable way it may have represented her hopes for the future a dowry the thought had occurred to her but shed shrugged it off certain that that had nothing to do with it men she had no real problems on that score although the fact remained she hadnt yet encountered the man not yet she didnt doubt that men found her interesting but she did not often find them interesting in return which led her to the suspicion that she might be too particular was she too particular she felt sure that she was not for she had had her moments unfortunately only one of them could be deemed truly brilliant and she could not recall much more of him than the pertinent fact he had surely not been the man had he been they might be together now here in this hotel this hotel that was smothering her with services she couldnt quite get used to someone tapped at the door and she stifled the feeble oui that issued up from her throat service a youthful deep rumble penetrated the heavy door which she opened a young waiter impeccably clad in crisp white jacket black bowtie and a generous smile wheeled a table laden with covered silver servingdishes into the room voulezvous mangez toute de suite madame oh ah you speak english yes oh yes she said sorry that none of her useful words and phrases sprang to mind will you eat now or later the boy spoke in halting english but with an easy disarming cheerfulness busily setting a place at the little table beside the window thank you she flushed embarrassed by an inability to match the boys lack of constraint you are american yes the boy beamed yes then it is a pleasure to see you it is not often that we have a lady like you in the hotel like me what was coming she tensed balancing on the balls of her feet ready to fly at the boys least insult yes noire but not noire oh we have had many groups from vafrique but it is not the same no you are more like our gentilles antiliaises antiliaises she settled back onto her heels i think you say in english west indian ladies yes oh yes eating her solitary dinner she thought about the boy who had been charming with a forthright simplicity that she had never known in the united states americans she thought a little defensively have a charm different and distinct the charm of jeanclaude for example could only be compared to that of other european men jeanclaude where was he having his dinner or was he having it at all perhaps in a rush of gallic defiance hed gone through that purported list of french girls less prudent than you american girls she had giggled inwardly then and giggled outwardly now the thought that french girls were less opposed than american girls to cold clammy hands that roamed uninvited seemed preposterous to her she hadnt been convinced and he hadnt come anywhere near the point what was it that could turn her definitively on there had been that night when after nearly two weeks of his wheedling she had said all right simply and straightforwardly she had agreed to go take a nitecap at his apartment but it had been the ensuing leer of triumph skittering across his almost too handsome face that signaled a final no nevertheless she had gone up because shed already said yes a completely negligible move as far as she was concerned for she was certain that nothing would come of it and nothing had coming across on the boat she had had a very brief enlightening introduction to european gallantry men had pursued her just as openly as they pursued other unattached girls aboard and it had been mildly amusing then in paris she had encountered jeanclaude who appeared still less concerned with the color of her skin in fact for the briefest moment before doubt began to nudge her naturally wary innerself the idea that here was a man a white man regarding her as just another pretty very eligible girl appealed to her for the briefest moment she suspected that maybe this may be indeed the year and if it turned out to be then how nice to break clear from all that unpleasantness at home she wasnt however bowled over by jeanclaude gallant and attentive in a way totally unfamiliar to her their goodnights at the door of her hotel were never atingle she was never sure whether his approach was truly subtle or just clumsy with that nervous expectancy once aroused in her by say harry jones the harry jones who although long gone into that dim corner of things past had made an unforgettable bid for immortality in her book of things not easily forgotten jeanclaude had taken her to dine in places she sensed to be select and he had shown her to people to whom he waved but who seldom ventured as near as their table when they did it was to address him in rapidfire french that sounded fine and foreign to her cars interspersed as it often was with rich laughter strolling the grands boulevards or in the bois people often stared after or directly at them at such times she would have given an arm or a leg to know just what they were seeing were they seeing a handsome young couple or just a colored girl being misled by a wily frenchman worse did they imagine that here was another baudelaire french unfortunate victimized by an inclination toward vice and the will of an unscrupulous colored girl in any event she rarely pursued it very deeply for she found the entire process terribly unpleasant furthermore she was surprised to discover that it didnt really make much difference to her what they were seeing what they thought jeanclaudes thoughts which he managed extremely well to keep to himself interested her infinitely morethe first time he kissed her well there youve been caught kissing a white man can you get lynched for it flashed through her thoughts and hers was an insensate desire to laugh intended in the spirit of a liberal sense of humor which she did possess she didnt find this particular thought however very funny for definitely in the category sloppy kiss of a nature too inquisitive not commensurate with so brief a relationship it surely would not have been worth getting lynched for having dared she pushed him rather brusquely away whats the matter have i presumed too much his voice already hoarse with anticipation vibrated less chagrin than worry that his technique may have been ineffective and once more she felt an insensate desire to laugh because it occurred to her that the kiss may have been more successful had it been possible for him to embrace himself no she managed to whisper its just that i wouldnt want to be seen like that in the street in the street he was incredulous what difference pulling her toward him this is paris and you mustnt concern yourself with trivialities yes she said wondering how this illusion that paris was so different exempt from simple modesty had permeated the skins of so many thousands convinced them that here more than anywhere else in the world anything was possible nothing mattered she deftly parrying his subsequent attempts at seduction soon escaped into the hotel and up to the calm of her room a definite decision was in order she realized but couldnt bear the prospect of another of those kisses the following night she refused an invitation to accompany him to his flat for a nitecap pouring herself another glass of wine now she finished the remainder of the strawberries then lit a cigarette poor jeanclaude its not that im hard to get im just not easily had like most girls how angry he had been when at last she had relented accompanied him to his flat only to explain to him the impossibility of it all flustered impatient to be on with it he had after a few preliminary kisses begun to explore and tug at the complexities of the various fastenings of her suit she sprang to her feet rearranging her somewhat troubled hair look dear boy a few kisses dont give you free title to the place she said managing a thin smile necessary counter to the anger welling up inside her what jeanclaude scrambled to his feet not having understood and making no effort to conceal what she considered a lack of selfcontrol and therefore a lack of respect for her i mean ive kissed you because i was willing to do it but it doesnt give you the right to undress me the words tumbling from her lips stung how could she explain that there were ways of doing it ways of arriving at that pointofnoreturn how could she explain that it was useless now that he was just a clumsy impatient bear of a man a child no his entire demeanor expressed an innate willingness to knock her down possibly tear away her clothing and achieve his aims in a primitive fashion because it was what he wanted a really primitive affair well no jeanclaude and that goes for all the rest of the apes like you he drove her back to her hotel in a rage of petulant silence during which she merely stared not the least bit wistfully out the window she watched the street feeling a source of history vibrating from the building facades sensing that much of that history had been implement in the formation of the history of her own country her own country there was the thrill she became warm at the thought of a place of her own to return to her own flat in new york city feeling warm and good inside she was already moving toward home turning out the light she crept in between the cool sheets grateful for their caressing smoothness and her last thoughts before drifting off to sleep were oh goodbye jeanclaude i wonder whats on sale at bloomingdales the utrillo print on the wall was the same as ii any other utrillo print a street with leafless trees people and buildings but there were other pictures too and there was a carpet on the floor and elegant chairs to be used by elegant people nina wasnt so elegant there werent many people only four other girls they didnt look as if they just happened to be lucky enough to run off their jobs for a visit to an optometrist they looked as if they could command someone to call the doctor and dictate when they could visit his office the doctor himself was very tall and rather pale but his hair was a golden glowing red also he was a proud walker one could easily understand that from the way his shoulders were upright and drawn back in an almost militaristic manner he was a youngish older man he came out to his reception room to tell his first patient goodbye and he glanced about the room and down at a dark green book he looked up quizzically and politely miss gallagher youre next the girl rose and followed him gratefully it was nina wondered whenor ifher turn would be she thought she should tell him that her appointment had been made over a week ago but then how could she when he hadnt seemed even to notice that she was there when he entered the room perhaps she should not have taken alberts advice perhaps she should have gone to the negro eye doctor the way she had wanted to do but albert had said no that that guy couldnt fix eyes any better than he could and that she would be just wasting her hardearned money and her time you want a doctor he told her go to a doctor not some jackleg of a medicine man who dont know what hes doing and goin overcharge too since she was living with cousin albert and his family she thought she should do what he said out of respect for him rather than for what he thought now this white man was coming out to his fine reception room and not even really paying attention to his little green book if he had he would have seen that she was listed there for thursday noon she hadnt been in new jersey long but she could see that the people were different down home at dr johnsons office there were always a lot of people and sometimes he would rush in and say ill get to you next mrs so and so be patient with me and you didnt mind waiting well you minded but you waited because you knew that doctor was really pressed for time like colored folks get and doing the best he could besides he was a colored man and you were proud that he was a doctor and had his office in your neighborhood although he didnt live there but yet and still you realized he must have had a hard time getting to be a doctor and so you waited at pm the doctor came for another patient he smiled warmly and said sorry i made you wait he was a charming man his eyes were very blue the girl smiled back she was the last white woman nina was the only other patient left nina thought he might decide to close his office and tell her to come back tomorrow like the ones of his kind down home yes he might just decide to close his office she gathered her purse and stood up to go she was angry surely he had written down her name the day she called but he hadnt even seen her she just couldnt understand white folks she didnt like being last either not when she felt that she had called earlier in the week she sat down again no ill stay and i will tell that cracker exactly what i think i had no business coming here this money shouldve gone to a negro doctor anyway these people have enough money already albert hasnt got any race pride or he wouldve seen to it that l had a negro doctor he knew good and well i just got up here but then the doctor was passing by her and opening the door for his patient and he turned toward her youre missjust a second he jerked up the book miss willis come in just sit here she sat down she thought he looked most peculiar as if he were not long awakened he asked a lot of questions now he said i want you to tell me if the red spot you see is moving right left or up and down do you see it yes ok she answered his questions hoping that the examination would not last much longer ever wore glasses before no what type of work do you do factory i work in a mica factory what a mica factory i cut the discs for little television parts its very thin stuff like glass but its not really glass its like plastic i guess do you think some got into your eyes i dont know but they hurt do you read a lot not too much why was he looking at her like that white people up north were most peculiar he said excuse me and left the room now hes making me wait again ive got to get out of here glasses or no glasses the green book was open miss willis she read so she was right her name was number two on his list and he an eye doctor should fix his own eyes here he said wash your eyes no just look up he held the dropper and a stinging mist fell into her eyes doctor im in a hurry why arent your eyes the most important thing yes but i have to get back to my job you have beautiful eyeslike that really lovely he leaned very close to her ive got to go but when she moved from the chair he caught her and held her to himself then he was embracing her then kissing her he didnt seem to hear her say stop and so she said stop white man his body became rigidfor only a secondand then he kissed her again love he said but it wasnt actually the word he used is the supreme equalizer the supreme equalizer let me go let me go no when i saw you come in i knew i knew in your eyes micas in my eyes you do believe that love this time he said loveis the supreme equalizer dont you why dont you believe black white they dont matter love brings you to my level love and he said a lot of things in the same vein his red hair rumpled and his suit completely disheveled his eyes were very wild and he seemed much too red and very exhausted as if he might fall over or something ive got to get out of here nina was thinking if this white man should die they would put the blame on me they would surely put the blame on me she straightened her clothes and fixed her hair watching the man he was composed now and he wore the white seemingnottosee look just as he had worn it earlier as she sat in the waiting room his eyes were cold blue again but there was still the slightest bit of warmth in them quickly nina turned to leave the doctor was sitting in the chair where she had sat and he was looking at her she was drawn toward him but then she ran out the door still she could hear his warm gentle voice saying just remember love is the supreme equalizer nina was a great distance from the elegant office before she could think about her job or about cousin albert oh lord she panicked what will i tell that fool cousin of mine and then she said to herself white folks are the same everywhere they all think that theres at least one thing a black person got to do to be equal to them theres always at least one little thing for historian lerone bennett jr one of the beautiful experiences at the core convention in california was listening to ambassador michael lukumbuzya of tanzania the ambassador is unique in many ways to begin with he is dazzlingly eloquent without exhibiting any of the arrogance which usually accompanies such eloquence then he has no apparent problems of status which is one of the handicaps which befall many highranking africans when it comes to communicating with afroamericans and best of all the ambassador sees the complexities of power in the world as clearly as he speaks ambassador lukumbuzya is a spokesman for his countrys political position which is considerably to the left of where most of the western powers would like it to be like his president julius nyerere he has no illusions about making it in a world where the big powers swallow the little underdeveloped countries almost at will on the other hand he has no intention of selling the people of tanzania tanganyika and zanzibar down the hatch in the name of interdependency and cooperative development at the second conversations with africa conference sponsored by the phelpsstokes fund at capahosic virginia last spring see the july negro digest ambassador lukumbuzya had the occasion to state his countrys position with great emphasis he was advised by a smooth afroamerican an employee of some years with the state department that interdependency seemed the best way of bringing such underdeveloped countries as tanzania into the modern world the government man was joined by a distinguished afroamerican jurist who suggested that afroamerican dollars invested in black africa was a means of providing muchneeded capital without raising his voice above its customary level of quiet emphasis the ambassador attacked he described how interdependency worked in black africa by citing an example in his own country a mineral exploiting firm had been invited into the country to establish a mining complex the assumption being that the industry would result in new jobs satellite industries and a viable new community what actually happened was that the exploiters came in ravaged the earth of its valuable minerals provided no homes or technological work or training for the local citizens and then departed the area leaving exhausted mines and general despair however the mineral wealth was taken out of africa the ambassador made it quite clear that tanzania would have no more of that he also made it clear that afroamericans were welcome in tanzaniabut only if they came to help that is only if they came to tanzania willing to join with the people there live with them share with them and grow with them afroamericans are no more welcome to come into tanzania as exploiters than any other americansor europeansand especially since so many afroamericans these days are roaming the nonwhite world as agents of the same old white masters what is so wonderful about ambassador lukumbuzya apart from his views is the fact that he takes the time to meet with and to communicate with his black brothers in america this cannot endear him with the power interests in this country but it makes him beautifully black frederick campbell is a painter with the keen insight of a sociologist but with an essential difference he has a deep love and appreciation for the objects of his painters eye and his affection shows in the strokes of his brush which capture illuminating moments and emotions in the faces and gestures of his subjects the artists memory is long in the april issue of ebony magazine a startlingly graphic picture was published showing a woman reclining voluptuously on a bed while her husband sat on the beds edge the photograph was one of a number used to illustrate the plight of black southern migrants who had moved to california to find work as cotton pickers and had found racism and unemployment instead more than a decade later mr campbell remembered that womans pose in his painting the hustler which projects an entirely different context from the california scene and where pickers way after he finds inspiration the painting the evolved in the everycotton following a book calledreading drum i wanted to paint a picture of the type of negro i thought was depicted in the book mr campbell said one thing led to another so i began thinking that the reason we dont all look alike is among other things because we came from different types of black people to begin with now the plot thickens i added to my idea a woman knowing of at least two different types imported to this countryone of the true negroid type coming from the baluba or bacuba tribes the man and two coming from the mangbetu tribes which are almost mongoloid in appearance the woman now having gotten this fixed needed a composition so i thought a straightforward approach would be best when this was done i thought of how much it reminded me of the grant wood painting american gothic so i wanted to add something of underlying meaning and feeling to my people i put a faint smile of diplomatic temporary submission on the mans lips but with hidden defiance showing in his eyes the woman is showing withdrawn but stubborn defiance which could be mistaken as a squint because of the sun the background shows the bareness our people found in the new land that was forced on them mr campbell is a native philadelphian and a former student at the hussian school of art last spring a major exhibition of his paintings and drawings was presented at the hampton institute college museum by curator dr richard a long what might herald an w awakening seems now to be in progress among the influential molders of public opinion in the united states of america it is taking place as a reaction to the angry violent and widespread outbursts of afroamericans which led to the serious casualties in several important cities notably newark and detroit such is the conclusion reasonably to be inferred from a survey of the editorial page of the new york times of sunday july this journal be it noted is the most conservative and powerful daily paper published in the usa the leading editorial of the times seeks to assess the responsibility white and black it begins by observing that the powerful forces of this revolt are unprecedented there follows immediately the extraordinary quotation of that penetrating analysis of the world situation made at the opening of this century by the farseeing dean of afroamerican letters william edward burghardt dubois the very man who was condemned as a radical and arrested and humiliated as such at the behest of the power structure now the opening paragraph of this editorial in the new york times quotes as follows the words of the noted negro scholar dr w e b dubois were prophetic when he wrote decades ago the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color linethe relation of the darker to the lighter races of man this editorial then goes on to make the following significant acknowledgement and admission white americans of course must share the greater burden of responsibility the attempt is also made to spell out this responsibility in briefto help achieve full equality by certain concrete measures it is further recognized that negro americans too have their responsibilities which must be met if this confrontation crisis is to be overcome these responsibilities are seen by the new york times in terms of faith in the promise of america and the assurance blandly offered after some years years if the colonial period be included that its democratic institutions and democratic ethic must be seen as the high road that no basic change of policy is yet intended is apparent in the lapse into a tirade against paranoid rabble rousers and specifically against the h rap browns this is followed by a demand upon the negro community to make them powerless but no matter how afroamericans may disagree with some of the more impulsive utterances of young spokesmen like h rap brown it is certain generally that they will not respond to a summons to render up such youth leaders as sacrificial lambs still more significant however are certain statements made by new york times columnist c l sulzberger in foreign affairs the fractured giant pointing to divisions ripping apart the american structure this writer moves directly to the recognition race is not only our most important national issue but also our most important international issue pointing further to the nonwhite world majority this correspondent concludes we cannot forever entertain wholesome peaceful relationships abroad unless we compose our own racial disputes this analyst then probes for the cause and finds no logical explanation of racism or even an acceptable definition of race on which anthropologists can agree looking back into history for the origin of racism c l sulzberger arrives at the basic and revealing facts as follows until the fifteenth century europefrom which our ancestors cameknew no such prejudices it developed only as exploration opened foreign lands inhabited by sources of labor that could easily be enslaved here it should be observed that this is the same basic historical analysis which has been set forth and documented in the book the name negro its origin and evil use the commentator sulzberger continued with the following significant observation this cynical factor was most efficiently exploited in africa our second great continent of origin and because we blandly ignored the constitution and the bill of rights for decades ignoring the claim of afroamericans to be free as euroamericans and even today disputing their claim to be equal we are at last paying the bill it is enlightening to note how by delving into history to find the origin of race in the development of the modern slave system this analyst and commentator was thus brought directly to the continental origins of the two major groups of the population of the u s a through his understanding of prior history culture and lands of origin and also because of his emphasis on freedom this writer is thereby led logically easily and naturally to use the appropriate terms and names to designate these two great groups of citizens of the u s a namely afroamericans and euroamericans here indeed is a cardinal lesson and it is to be hoped a signficant beginning of the removal of prejudice from american habits of thought speech daily practice and customary attitude in a third article on this same editorial page of the new york times the two faces of the negro revolution william v shannon attempts to assess the present violence and unrest among afroamericans in the light of similar great upheavals elsewhere having not yet attained to the historical understanding of the background as arrived at by sulzberger shannon continues to use though perhaps unconsciously the racist slave designation negroes nevertheless a step forward is taken toward the recognition of americans of african descent as human by considering these present eruptions of afroamericans as in some respects like the natives in a europeanruled colony or the submerged workers in paris and st petersburg before the french and russian revolutions but no mention is made of the haitian revolution of or of its signal role in the abolition of chattal slavery and later in the liberation of latin america through the decisive aid rendered to general bolivar by president petion of haiti nor does mr shannon recall the uprisings throughout the caribbean during in barbados alone the toll was killed wounded and jailed these socalled disturbances signalled a turning point from colonialist subjugation towards advancement and independence specifically comparing the present situation with events in algeria in the late s and in ireland in william v shannon notes the conflict arising between leaders liberal and middle class in their outlook and the radicals who challenged and supplemented them the new radicals shannon concludes the stokely carmichaels and the h rap browns are challenging the older middle class negro leaders on quite different grounds for them the analogy of the negro revolution is with the nationalist revolutions of independence correctly and cogently shannon observes yet mere economic gains will not relieve the anger resentment and damaged selfrespect of people who feel separated from their fellow americans not only by economic inequality but also by the color of their skin while we agree with this writer that neither harlem nor newark nor mississippi is likely to become an independent negro republic we are nevertheless certain that the solution is not to be found simply or solely in negro owned street corner businesses and the houses in which negroes take community pride far more fundamental changes in the whole structure of american society and in its mores customs and attitudes will have to be achieved in order to bring about peaceful and viable relations not only must full economic opportunity be achieved in business and in executive positions and in labor especially in the higher crafts and the skills of tomorrow but also political voting administration and power as well as cultural recognition and the frank accordance of human dignityall are essential to a genuine solution as the great afroamerican leader frederick douglass declared long ago in his reply to president andrew johnson at the outset of the reconstruction period after the civil war peace between races is not to be secured by degrading one race and exalting another by giving power to one race and withholding it from another but by maintaining a state of equal justice between all races first pure then peaceable it is pedestrian enough a beginning to say that i was a college senior myself seventeen years ago though still relatively young i feel that the years of my public life fit me to say something relevant to the college graduates of today in retrospect of those years have been spent in the pastoral and preaching ministry the remainder have been almost equally divided between being a revolutionary and being a part of the establishment when i think back to at the time when i was a college graduate what i would have wanted most was for someone to tell me the truth about the kind of world that awaited me speeches addresses and some sermons are a dime a dozen but the presentation of truth is awesome to speak it requires courage to write the truth is very often dangerous to live it guarantees an early death cf one galilean named jesus for the sake of brevity suffice it to say that there are some things about the society you are about to enter that ought to be verbalized just in case you havent found out already there are three points that i submit for your close scrutiny the first has to do with a crime the second has to do with vietnam and the third has to do with god crime we must face the harsh reality that the endproduct of our american system is a racist society based on color prejudice most of the process takes place by calculated design accommodation to the racist result is largely involuntary to be specific the crime i mentioned above is the crime of the western historians who have carefully written the black man out of the chronicles of the past the psychosis of racial supremacy requires removaldestruction of the objectionable kindand so by historical genocide the black men in world and western civilization were done in by men who knew better but accommodated themselves and their tasks to city hall the crown the ku klux klan whatever that is the crime rob a people of their sense of history and you take away their hope but it is not alone a crime against black men it is also a crime against all other men the absence of truth in history made them become involuntary race supremacists during the most critical and formative years of childs development the days of public and private school lifethe learning materials used the history texts the social studies books are and per cent white the domination of white over black that began in this hemisphere with the slave trade has been perpetually and persistently reenforced in the total learning process of the individual and the group in america honesty impels me to confess that we black people have been mentioned however in those sparse instances where black life was noticed the distortions are almost unbearable when compared to the truth how can i explain to my three sons and daughter that frederick douglass is a far more attractive hero than booker t washington when there is no record of a frederick douglass in most public school history texts is it no wonder that white children are poisoned with racism and prejudice as soon as they learn their abcs as far as the record discloses black people began as slaves small wonder that negroes repress any thought or notion of their slave ancestry for the books not only disclose it as a fact but strongly infers that we didnt resist slavery white america has never had a chance to understand and comprehend the horroryes the horror of slavery in america i request equal time and attention for our slave experience given the jews who were exterminated under hitler what would an accurate chronicle of the foregoing reveal how interesting that absolutely authentic and documented sources detail highly developed ancient subsahara nations which paralleled the nations of the dark ages in europe that means that while anglos and saxons were living in caves in the forests and using stone axes to find something to eat in the heart of africa there were kings and princes and exporters and importers great schools of learning precise systems of currency and what must be considered for that age advanced technology that included the weaving of cloth and the smelting of brass and iron yes we were slaves but before that we were kings and queens and men of commerce and industry we never did like slavery and our masters knew it before there were more than slave revolts how is it that i never knew of nat turner and denmark vesey until i became a student at virginia union i repeat that the endproduct of our american system as it is now constructed is a racist society white and black alike the brainwashing affected us too i recall vividly now that after reading seventhgrade geography my impressions of slavery were not very bad but i dare you to review the autobiography of frederick douglass and to read the description of the cruel disposition of peoplefathers mothers sons and daughterson the occasion of an estate being settled after a certain slave owners death this is a small indication of why the churchrelated and independent colleges must be preserved it is to virginia unions honor and glory that the study of negro heritage is required to say that the endproduct of our american system is a racist society is a severe indictment but it also is accurate and sound it is sound or why else has america been unable to respond to the increasingly incessant demand for unqualified equal opportunity by the black community much of the hysteria that surrounds black_power is directly traceable to the nations guilt during the last dozen years after the most frenetic activity in the race relations arena in the wake of thousands of jailings hundreds of thousands of dollars expended and millions of ergs of energy invested the black community finds itself in worse condition now than it was in whereas the use of black_power as a slogan is tatically unsound the larger community must understand the legitimacy of this cry of despair and frustration when you draw the bottom line we are further behind than we were when the supreme court ruled favorably in the historic brown vs board of education case in what is the nations excuse can you be convinced that we do not have the material resources or the creative programs or the knowhow we do not have the will it is the perennial lowpriority given to the concerns of the black community in america that has spawned the black_power spectrum america cannot blame stokely carmichael america needs to blame america let me suggest a for instance we have had a major and specific voting rights bill years overdue the department of justice has notcannot will notprovide sufficient federal registrars to guarantee the unhampered right to vote all over the south the alleged problem manpower yet in the santo domingo crisis some months ago within hours america put marines ashore it is a clear matter of priority the bare reality is that america does not yet have the moral maturity to deal totally with the dilemma of race until america is able to digest the concept of intermarriage there will not be any lasting and significant breakthrough in race relations to narrow the province of my selection of a partner in marriage to my own kind is to deny my basic humanity if you do not accept me first as a human being then you do not give a tinkers dam as to what kind of job opportunity i have where i live and what kind of education my children secure the die is cast america either we must be provided unqualified equal opportunity or we must be exterminated vietnam the present dilemma in southeast asia and our hysterical response to dissent on the conduct of the war has overtones of this same racism first the fine hand of racism betrays itself in the bitter denunciation of dr martin_luther_king jr i say without reservation that martin_luther_king is the most marvelous human being i have ever encountered this may seem like an overstatement but you see i havent met everybody i need file no brief for dr_kings historical importance time will take care of that im sure he is without peer in the social revolution he is an able and gifted preacher he is a possible throwback to the orators of several generations ago he has had some considerable influence on the theological thinking of our day he was in fact the nobel honoree for peace in this is the man who has been vilified most for taking a position against the war in vietnam consider for a moment that all of the credentials catalogued above are negated because of the circumstances of color who is the adversary in this circumstance there is no need to list the far right the segregationists etc some are former white liberals they presume wrongly that breaking with martin_luther_king leaves their liberality intact they recount their unstinting support of civil_rights and they add but dr_king lost me at the u n they decry the mixing of civil_rights and the peace movement as if to sayand some dothat martin_luther_king is either unqualified to speak on matters of foreign policy or his arena is civil_rights and he ought to stay in his place then there are some former black liberals who presume that they too are qualified i guess by their blackness to denounce dr_king for dragging civil_rights into the peace movement the norfolk journal and guide one of the best papers we have editorialized in this tone the grim portent of hurting the civil_rights movement is underscored without much attention given to rightness or wrongness of dr_kings position in the same vein one of our new york papers headlined a release from the freedom foundation based in valley forge pa i believe thusly responsible negro leadership denounces kings peace stand as i read the article and saw the names of the negroes involved there was no guessing who they were they were the same negroes who a few months and years ago we had to drag literally drag kicking and screaming through the sitins the freedom rides the march on washington and the selma to montgomery march these were the responsible negro leaders who denounced dr_king remember we dragged them kicking and screaming you can have them theyre all yours in the second place somewhere sight has been lost of the fact of the complete immorality of our involvement by what tortuous route did we come by our advisorship and thence to a man war when french colonialism died in southeast asia we were at the side of the french with dollars and materiel helping them to reestablish colonialism colonialism as you know is another name for slavery finally france lost her stomach for that lost cause but we wanted to continue we fought against the geneva accord of unsuccessfully and then refused to sign it then we helped to make diem dictator and kept him dictator until he lost his usefulness to our purposes it is a fact that he was one of the most brutal and corrupt men in asia and chief betrayer of the geneva accord i ask the same question sen robert kennedy asks what are we doing in vietnam i suspect that the u s military bases which ring southeast asia are our only concern and that is selfserving and selfdefeating third there is no connection apparently between dr_kings position on vietnam and that of other outstanding leaders in national and govemment life i refer to the new york times of april where in four different speeches by senators of different political stripe and temperament there is stated the substance of dr_kings speech at the u n senators fulbright mcgovern gruening and robert f kennedy the secretary general of the u n u thant agrees that the escalation of the war in vietnam is moving us toward world war iii dr benjamin spock has not been publicly chided to my knowledge to go back to tending babies but martin_luther_king well i think the message is clear the sum and substance of the king position on vietnam and its connection with human rights in america is a question of the moral capacity of our nation can we respond to the demands of morality if america has no morality beyond her shores how can she be moral at home or stated conversely if america has no morality at home how can she be moral in southeast asia god that brings me to the final concern the challenge of this age is to resist and conquer in each of our own being the racist brainwashing that is still active in our midst if there is no other significance to this day it must be noted that students have had an opportunity to develop their individual potential in an aura of academic freedom and independence thats what virginia union and hampton and morehouse are all about these hallowed grounds and dear old walls reek with the sacrifice of noble saints who refused to go along with the system black and white they believed under god in the full humanity of the newly freed men and their progeny in those early days wooden buildings would have been acceptable but they insisted that the walls be of granite to depict permanence and solidity the form of education was in the classical tradition uncle remus tales would not do for reading lessons it had to be thomas paine and rousseau and latin in iambic pentameter and the greek of xenephons anabasis to be absolutely sure that our grandparents had a chance at exactly the same things the students at harvard and yale and smith received the fundamental basis of that insistence was their commitment to the hebraic christian tradition this is a wicked world but it can be made better the black colleges must survive their best chance is in the extension of black students and their lives to the world as far as we have come we have come most of the way on the strength of our preachers and teachers and doctors and lawyers many of them nameless whose baccalaureate degrees were conferred by the churchrelated and independent colleges and universities that we founded and nurtured in the hebraicchristian tradition the relevance of what i am getting at is corroborated in the lives of the alumni of these institutions it is not by chance that the chairman of the board of trustees of virginia union for example has galvanized his profession into meaningful involvement in the present social revolution dr john holloman has marched and demonstrated in the south for three summers aided by his leadership the medical profession has made wide services available where none were before but more importantly he has been a gadfly within his profession fighting racism unequivocally in the health services of the nation he has taken his fight to the congress of the united states on more than one occasion there are others too numerous to mention milton reid here in virginia walter fauntroy in the nations capital virgil wood in boston these men have committed their lives to the fundamental principles upon which black colleges were founded wherever they work and live whatever they do there is exhibited a tenacity that disclosed they know the things for which they struggle are just and right win lose or draw be under no illusion children have v been brainwashed into believing that they are jy inferior beings it is the general concensus that the white race is responsible for white superiority propaganda there is undoubtedly much truth to this but believe me whites have had some strong allies among negroes themselves negroes who are responsible for the training of young minds must bear a part of the blame for the insecurities among their people i imagine that as far back as the average negro can recollect he has been indoctrinated with the idea of white superiority it is easy to make the white race the scapegoat for this fallacy what few negroes realize or are willing to admit is that if negroes had a firm and secure belief in themselves it would be difficult for someone to give them an inferior image the negroes who are partly responsible for this indoctrination i label negro propagandists these solid citizens band together in social cliques which lack the characteristics of a true social circle and form what i call social knots their members are oound together by a special type of insecurity outwardly they present a picture of efficiency and unquestionable belief in themselves they place themselves above caring what the other race thinks about them they lead the type of social life they lead because that is what they want to do they read certain books and wear certain styles of clothing because that is what they want to do they are beyond being influenced by another supposedly superior group of people at any rate that is what they want others to believe the pathetic truth of the situation is that the negro propagandist is unaware of his own subconscious beliefs in his own racial inferiortiy he has been brainwashed from his mothers knee all the way to adulthood his beliefs are deeply planted the propagandists mother worked for mrs soandso the grandeur and finery of the whitefolks world was breathtaking mrs soandsos spacious house her closets of beautiful clothes her bountifully laden dinner table all left mama flabbergasted to say the least at the end of each weary day mama filled the childrens ears with the splendor of the whitefolks world the beauty of that other world was indelibly imprinted on the minds of the young listeners their daydreams were based on the happiness and the finery they believed existed in the world of mr and mrs soandso character values and human frailties were not ingredients which were included in this world of dreams in the allnegro schools the same children who had listened at mamas knee and who had compared their lots with that of mrs soandso were further brainwashed into believing in the superiority of that other world the negro teacher whose indoctrination had also begun with mamas tales used the phrase like the white people as though it were a whip children please come to school clean and fresh tomorrow comb your hair and wear your nicest outfits the white children will be at the planetarium too listen to classical music because white children listen to classical music dont you want to be like the white children practice good table manners like the white children when these same children reach adulthood they have the tendency to seek ideals they believe white people would embrace they play golf form bridge clubs garden clubs and even take trips to europe for basically the same reason with which they have been indoctrinated since early childhood now there isnt anything wrong in encouraging children to practice good health habits or to desire the finer things in life neither is bridge golf or a european tour undesirable it is the motive for doing these things that is undersirable why not simply do these things because they will enrich ones life one should accept new behavior patterns and ideals because they will make one a happier person the practice of behaving the way one thinks another race behaves in order to acquire happiness is absurd how can one be sure that the adoption of certain behavior patterns can bring happiness what is wrong with enjoying a barbecue instead of a garden party what is wrong with a western film instead of a shakespearean play if one would enjoy and understand it better what is wrong with being ones self just plain you self improvement doesnt come from pretense the idea that another race is truly happy doing these things is based on circumstantial evidence supplied by mama when she worked for mrs soandso is an illiterate domestic worker qualified to properly judge and evaluate all the situations she encounters false assumptions are born this way negro propagandists are usually professional people who are in a position to guide and to help less fortunate negroes seldom do they extend a helping hand instead they assume a special kind of superiority they form tight little social knots whose only purpose is to see which individual can more closely resemble mamas picture of mrs soandso to the outsider their little game of mimicking seems to bring unbelievable pleasures they are secure in their own social paradise but are they really all it would take to rattle their apparent security would be the introduction of one white individual into their knot an example that comes to mind is the announcement made in an allnegro school that there would be a white studentteacher from the nearby recently integrated negro teachers college on the campus in a few weeks plans had to be made the principal carefully scrutinized his faculty to find the best suited criticteacher on his staff after this decision had been made slow learners and unkempt students were ushered into some other teachers classroom when the young apprehensive white student arrived fighting her own preconceived ideas she was presented with a classroom of spotless aboveaverage pupils one lone frightened student had turned an entire school upside down the principal and his faculty are considered to be highly respected members of the society knot why had they panicked why did they have to impress an apprentice in their own field why did inferiority run amuck did they secretly harbor feelings of white superiority its funny perhaps pathetic would be a better wordhow negro propagandists flaunt their superiority over other negroes when they are in their own realms then one lone white individual can shatter their facade the younger generation of negroes has also been able to see through their flimsy veneer they rebel against these modern uncle toms the young lack respect for teachers ministers social workers and even parents who attempt to force upon them a set of values that reek of phony security they ask the question why they find the game of mimicking disgusting not exactly knowing what to do about the situation they lash out against the white race in general and those members of their own race who expect them to swallow such beliefs this type of behavior is as wrong as the negro propagandist who mimics what he believes life is like in the whitefolks world hate campaigns and inferiority campaigns bear the same markings it is time for the negro to stop and reevaluate himself the recently passed civil_rights acts permit them the opportunity of seeing first hand not through mamas eyes what white americans are really like integrated educational facilities gives each individual the chance to judge people by his relationship with them superiority and inferiority have no place in this learning process todays first graders are learning for themselves what my generation had to literally play by ear they are learning that neither race of americans are all perfect or all imperfect all wealthy or all poverty stricken all highly educated or all illiterate perhaps they will be able to learn from each other superiority and inferiority must come from within a belief in ones self is the antidoteto the implantation of seeds of insecurity in many instances we are not as advanced in student government as other institutions but i am determined that were going to set up some kind of student government in which they the students handle all student discipline that does not stem from academic work this is not going to be wholeheartedly supported by all of the faculty but im going to get this approval i cant go any further with this kind of heavyhanded operation so im going to stop it james madison nabrit jr president of howard university had seemingly made his position clear in the interview carried in the washington post he reflected upon the gains of howards first years and the goals and aspirations that he had for the future the centennial year was over halfcompleted and for the most part the scheduled year long activities had progressed as planned seldom drawing more than small recognition in the daily papers less than three weeks later ronald o ross and leonard mccants both students and cochairmen of project awareness introduced the evenings guest speaker lt gen lewis b hershey of the selective service as the general began to speak a youth at the rear of the auditorium stood and yelled beast another screamed america is the black mans battleground at this point approximately students rushed to the stage waving signs saying america is the black mans battleground vietnam hell no and pictures of two hanging burned black men surrounded by a crowd of milling laughing whites the shock and bewilderment of the audience was visible evidence of their ignorance of the planned demonstration but perhaps even more important was the fact that over per cent of the audience cheered and applauded while the youths expressed their indignation and beliefs on the stage shortly after his assistance off the stage by the university police and administrators gen hershey in a classical stroke of paternal benevolence said i agree with the right to dissent but this is not the way to do it im a guest here but i dont criticize my host for what has happened that statement was published in all the papers what was not published at that time was the statement he also made that if you see a symbol of something that you are very much opposed to you take advantage of that symbol to protest it and i am a symbol i represent what these people are very much opposed to reactions were swift ronald ross one of the sponsors of the generals visit stated more of this type of reaction will occur until america solves its problem concerning the black man the other cosponsor was quotedas having said as a black person myself i found the entire affair repulsive the following day ernest goodman howards public relations director was quoted in the washington evening star as saying that only one of the demonstrators who surged onto the stage was identified as a student others he said were nonstudents known to be active in protest demonstrations in the washington area whether it is for civil_rights against the war in vietnam or what have you president nabrit mailed the general an official apology while in front of cramton auditorium a press conference was being held to announce the formation of the black_power committee dr nathan hare the oklahomaborn sociologist shared the reading of a prepared statement with huey labrie a freshman from oakland calif and robin gregory the pretty naturalhaired homecoming queen the committee they began has as its goals the overthrow of the negro college with white innards and to raise in its place a militant black university which will counteract the whitewashing black students now receive in negro and white institutions and at the same time responsible student leaders presented a statement to the press which stated that we decry and deplore the irresponsible premeditated and unforgivable manner in which gen hershey was treated and would like for it to be known that the manner in which these persons conducted themselves is in no way representative of the student community absent from the list of signatures was that of miss carolyn carter the editor of the hilltop the universitys student newspaper her comment the statement stinks on april four students including miss gregory the homecoming queen were scheduled to appear before a university disciplinary committee on charges stemming from the hershey demonstration in order to show their feelings about the hearings some or more students rallied and set fire to the hanging effigies of gen hershey pres nabrit and dean frank m snowden college of liberal arts after threatening to charge the committee room the dissenters regrouped on the campus and continued their rally the hearings were postponed for a later date one week later the faculty forum held a rally and charged the administration with three breeches of academic freedom denying students and faculty the use of campus institutions an unjust firing of a philosophy instructor and the kangaroo court trial of the students allegedly involved in the hershey affair the charge of denying the use of campus institutions was a result of the rescinding of permission to use cramton auditorium for a talk on vietnam by floyd mckissick the reason given for the rescinding order the facilities were overburdened during the centennial year keynote speakers at the rally were dr hare dr andress taylor of the english dept and prof ivan eames of the sociology dept unknown to anyone at that time all of these instructors would be fired within two months the following day about students forced their way past three doors and down a corridor with the intention of halting the rescheduled disciplinary hearings encouraged by students behind them they were only stopped by the locked door of the conference room the students called the hearings unfair and demanded that the charges be dropped or that the hearings be held in public the students refused to move until miss gregorys mother emerged from the conference room and stated that her daughter requested that they leave and allow her attorney to state his defense miss gregory came out and pleaded for compliance at which time jeroyd w jay greene a law student stated thats it brothers if she feels that she doesnt need or want our help then we have to respect her wishes to leave and they did jay greene was later to receive a letter stating that he would not be allowed to register in the fall almost daily rallies were being held in front of frederick douglass hall by the more vocal and militant members of the faculty and student body discussions and arguments ranged incessantly but the subjects seldom varied from black_power student autonomy the administration the draft and minister muhammad ali on saturday april rd dr hare the sociologist and former professional boxer addressed a nonuniversity authorized rally of people in front of douglass hall brothers and sisters he began it took the black_power committee to bring to howard university a man who is a better fighter and a better man than i am we who are gathered here today stand at the doorway of a new era of black pride and black selfassertion some men are born to lead us in this struggle one such man is muhammad ali the heavyweight champion of the world and minister of peace voicing the teachings of elijah muhammad proceeded to tell the sympathetic audience exactly why the black man is still catching hell the following week the university issued a point statement which protests must be confined outside the lecture hall and limited to orderly picketing a location shall be designated where students may conduct rallies at certain specified times the university shall not allow itself to be converted into either a recruiting place or a regular forum for advocates of any particular ideology discourtesy or incivility to guests visitors or members of the university shall not be permitted students and faculty may exercise their rights as citizens as individuals and not as representatives of the university a judiciary committee of students and faculty structured along the fundamentals of due process shall be maintained all public announcements and news releases shall be cleared through the public relations office arrangements to have representatives of the public communications media present on campus must be cleared by the public relations office all administrators faculty and students have a responsibility to abide by and support the above lawlessness and disorder shall not be permitted the university is dedicated to all races violations of any of the by the academic community shall be dealt with by the university in obvious disregard of the mandate the black_power committee held a press conference immediately after the announcement and a hilltop editorial called the attempt to turn the office of public relations into a censorship bureau the most outrageous of all student groups began to close ranks bridge differences and temporarily overlook ideological and political differences in their shaky but growing solidarity the student groups at howard range from the traditionally conservative social greek organizations and elected student government through the new student autonomyseeking students rights organization sro and the militant secret black_power committee continual charges of outside agitators were reminiscent of george wallace but nonetheless visitors from new york philadelphia newark watts and other black centers were constantly on campus often speaking before groups of students and faculty members between classes sometimes teaching sometimes learning but most often criticizing and encouraging in an offcampus meeting a group of students and faculty members were meeting to discuss what could and should be done in light of the administrations policy statement it was finally agreed to boycott but the problems that would have to be overcome for a successful boycott were staggering in order to be successful it was clear that over per cent of the student body would have to agree to stay out of classes how could a single program appeal to the black_power committee the sro the elected student government the greeks and the largest group of all at howard the nonaligned the committee agreed that if student demands were to be met it would be necessary to have at least one of the demands cover the needs of each student on campus on monday may jay greene told a gathering of some students that the boycott was a movement to free us from bonds that do not allow us to act as adults and as individuals the charismatic law student denounced the universitys paternalistic and totalitarian policies at that time greene stated that the campus chapter of the american association of university professors aaup went on record as supporting the student protests against the disciplinary proceedings surrounding the hershey incident greene predicted that the boycott would be per cent successful on the day preceding the boycott the university announced that threats on the life of president nabrit and other administration and faculty members had been received warning them to stay away from classes president nabrit was scheduled to be in new york on the day of the boycott honoring a long standing commitment to receive an award from brotherhood in action inc and to confer with a number of officials at a rally on the steps of douglass hall the boycott leaders stressed that doorways to all buildings would be picketed during the boycott but that there would be no interference with anyone attempting to attend classes on the morning of the boycott students living offcampus were met on their arrival by boycott committee workers with copies of the list of demands and a schedule of the days activities by this time the list had been revamped and compromised many times in order to draw the widest possible support the demands listed on the final draft were all charges against the four students allegedly taking part in the hershey incident be dropped as the university has no written code of conduct which they have violated a guarantee in writing that no action retroactively or prospectively be taken against any student because of his or her political activities during the current academic year abolishment of all senior comprehensive examinations since this university requires final exams in all courses and a minimum grade point average gpa of to graduate the senior comprehensive which is an additional exam raises an inference that final exams and gpas have no validity in determining the academic proficiency of prospective graduates that no faculty member be dismissed or denied promotion because of his political activism or nonconformity any university needs faculty members who espouse different or radical ideas because the academic growth of students depends upon exposure to different ideas and issues that compulsory rotc be abolished immediate repeal of the recent policy statement on student protest the policy as it now stands is totalitarian as well as paternalistic it is antithetical to academic freedom and is only an inducement to activist students to defy it thus it will tend to provoke demonstrations rather than accomplish its avowed purpose of curtailing demonstrations the signers included the student body president editor of the hilltop president of the liberal arts student council chairman of the sro chairman of the howard university student forum president of the interfraternity council and the black_power committee first on the agenda during the boycott was a faculty teachin in which the instructors spoke on any subject that pleased them it seems that the instructor who returned to microphone most often lectured on the absurdity of the boycott and the need for the students to return to their classes he was respectfully ignored a little later the record message to the grass roots by the late malcolm_x was played at eleven oclock a large contingent of law students marched from the law school to the university administration building with his back to the building william a blakely presidentelect of the student bar association faced a large crowd of students and read a petition opposing the policy statement that limited demonstrations over law students had signed the petition including jay greene and arthur goldberg these two students were among those to be felled by the dismissal axe during the summer recess the atmosphere surrounding their dismissals was itself puzzling goldberg more so than greene greene prized for his ability to rap as well as for his academic standing constantly insisted that the students demand autonomy over nonacademic functions and that they take greater pride in being black arthur goldberg was another matter also an excellent student it appears that his one mortal sin was that of reputation formerly a leader of student unrest at berkeley he frequently longed to take an active part in the growing student unrest at howard but goldberg a jew felt that howard as a black school should be lead out from under its present problems by black students at that time per cent of those students were staying out of their classes in the next few weeks all charges against miss gregory were dropped while the three young men were given written reprimands and deprived of the privilege of running for student offices during the next academic year almost as a prelude to the summers rebellious outbreaks across the country students and faculty members were stunned to discover early one morning that during the night someone or some group had spraypainted the words join the black guard in large black letters on the pillars of douglass hall along the side of the ira aldridge theater and on the side of an abandoned house harshly visible from the front of cramton auditorium a few days later fire department officials began investigating a series of suspicious blazes which had broken out on the campus students and faculty members were surprised to discover armed patrolmen and fire marshals in the corridors on each floor of the building the room in which i took one of my finals showed the result of one of those suspicious blazes the pulldown maps were little more than charred remains while that entire corner of the room was black every window in the room had cracked under the apparently intense heat if there was any doubt as to the seriousness of someones intentions it was eradicated while viewing the aftermath as i left the room i looked out the cracked windows at the recruitment appeal splattered on the wall a few hundred feet away join the black guard i wondered what would happen next during the fourth week of june i found out as many students had been predicting all along the university had waited until the summer and then fired five professors and expelled students the american civil liberties union aclu requested howard to reinstate the ousted students and faculty until they could be given a hearing the aclu board charged that the faculty had been dismissed and the students barred without due process for exercising freedom of speech the aclu threatened legal action if the university refused to hold a hearing the american association of university professors general secretary bestram davis sent a letter to the university asking howard to rescind its dismissal of five faculty members until they were accorded hearings the howard law alumni association of the greater washington area went on record as condemning the university andor interested parties responsible for the recent dismissal of students and faculty members without any semblance of administrative due process our condemnation flows from the fact that this unfair conduct is contrary to the historical role traditionally adhered to by howard university copies of the condemnation were sent to the board of trustees perhaps one of the most accurate gauges of student reaction was penned by law student taunya lovell banks in a letter to the editor of the washington post as a student i am fearful of the caliber of education i will receive in an atmosphere which openly and flagrantly stifles dissent and criticism i am both outraged and ashamed that my university has reacted in this distasteful manner because a courageous few sought to maintain through dissent the ideals once fostered by howard universityas an institution and as a composite of individuals on monday july president nabrit announced his desire to retire as soon as the board of trustees can find a successor in a statement issued through the office of public relations the president was quoted as saying emphatically that the unrest that has plagued the universitys campus during the past year did not influence his decision to retire at this time the report further stated that he was deeply distressed by the events of the past year as well as by the steps it became necessary for him to take in order to maintain law and order on the campus i was distressed too by the erroneous interpretation that some people gave to my actions intimating that i had deviated from my lifelong adherence to civil_rights civil liberties and freedom of speech the following day in a press conference president nabrit conceded that black_power on campus is all right until it disrupts the order that the process of education requires but when black_power attempts to make this a black institution it ceases to be a group in the civil_rights struggle and becomes an institution trying to set up control of howard this would result in the elimination of white members of the board the administration the faculty and the students i have fought all my life for integration and i do not propose to preside over this kind of thing at howard the type of thing that he is presiding over at howard at this time is similar to the growing nationwide demand of more student voice in student affairs howard however has an element that makes its case a particular one and that element is black_power the absolute refusal of the majority of campus organizations to allow their names to be used on any boycott literature that carried the slogan is proof enough of the controversial atmosphere surrounding it yet the majority of the campus black_power advocates were not members of the militant black_power committee these students believe that the greatest and perhaps the only prospect for improving the welfare of black people will have to be a collective political economic and social effort it will begin with the realization that none of the governmental programs in existence in this country today have lifted the level of life of the average black man it means realizing that if the government of the united states were to allot five states to black people tomorrow to set up a nation we would be bankrupt by the middle of next week because we are neither ready nor prepared to administrate it means that once the rebellions that raced across the country are over we are going to have to be prepared to help rebuild a nation of people either within the present governmental setup or in a completely new context it can and must be done but as students we are going to need room to grow to meet and to discuss when per cent of the student body boycotted last spring to show their desire for needed reforms their answer was a barrage of firings and dismissals it is not expected that that will be the end of student unrest dr hare has already turned down two offers at larger more richly endowed institutions while jay greene has refused an allexpense scholarship to the yale law school to remain here in washington and fight for his readmittance to howard the washington post in an editorial referred to the censureship clause of the university policy statement and called it not only objectionably paternalistic but unenforceable and unlikely to be obeyed commenting on the dismissal of the faculty members and expulsion of the students the editorial stated without offering any judgment as to the merits of these disciplinary decisions some of which are now being contested in the courts we are left with a strong impression that they were made arbitrarily without the elements of a fair hearing and in a manner certain to exacerbate unrest and anger on the campus this does not seem prudent policy in relation to a student body already seething it invites rebellion in the most cherished peaceful and nonviolent manner the students and faculty demonstrated their desires by boycotting classes and listing their reasons for doing so they were rebuked for their efforts but most tragic of all is the fact that the administration the students and the faculty all seek a greater howard unfortunately it still appears that the students and administration are on a collision course it is time to avert a needless but certain disaster postscript contrary to mr malsons wishes all did not go quietly and well when classes were resumed on september as president james m nabrit jr addressed the student body more than students and faculty members stalked out of cramton auditorium in protest against the universitys action in dismissing militant faculty members and expelling militant students outside the auditorium fired professor nathan hare spoke to the students and admonished them against listening to the lies of the university administration just put them out of business close them down because we are all domestic slaves mr hare is quoted as saying a suit challenging the dismissal of the students and the professors is pending in the united states court of appeals in washington d c a district court judge upheld the universitys action in the dismissals meanwhile dr nabrit has expressed some sympathy with the militants on the faculty and among the students he recognized that black people have grown tired of americas promises and that there is a spirit of revolt at work which will not be satisfied until a new order is established it is unfortunately true that negroes have not reaped the full harvest of their expectations africanamerican a y nationalism first came j into my life in j when i heard brother malcolm_x speak for the first time since that time it has become the dominant ideology in my life to me it includes all the various aspects of being part of a group culturally africanamerican nationalism demands that we as black people accept the fact that we have a distinctive and valuable cultural heritage which we must cherish nourish and pass along to our children it means that songs must be sung books must be written plays must be performedall extolling the rich and varied cultural heritage of our people africanamerican nationalism demands that the accepted criteria for beauty for worthiness for esthetic value be determined by us based upon what is good for us politically africanamerican nationalism demands that our community leaders be chosen solely by us based upon their contributions to the progress and security of the total group it demands that our leaders be representatives of our group to the larger community a representative is an integral part of the group from which he comes while an intermediator usually stresses his neutrality between two opposing forces africanamerican nationalism demands group solidarity not the kind of solidarity which totally suppresses internal dissent but the kind which instantly solidifies against any outside threat to the group this kind of nationalism operates under the principle may my people always be right but my people right or wrong it recognizes the fact that this country is based on racial religious and national groupings and that the individual progresses as his group progresses africanamerican nationalism rejects extreme groupdefeating individualism instead it stresses collective group action as the best means for promoting progress and security it judges events both nationally and internationally in terms of how they affect our group if it helps our people its good if not forget it it recognizes that just as a strong and stable family relationship helps the individual in his dealings with other groups africanamerican nationalism forms a solid base for effective political power for its allows us to form alliances from a position of strength with other groups whose interests coincide with ours on a particular issue it accepts the fact that power is what ultimately counts in relationships between groups just as it does in relationship between countries that is why we must develop group power in our constant struggle for survival and continuation as a distinctive people we have to remember another old but pertinent cliche we have no permanent friends permanent interests economically africanamerican nationalism demands that we use collective economic power wherever it is feasible as a means to improve our groups economic position the important word is collective the group must pool its economic resources in order to gain a most elementary positioneconomic control of our communities this collective power can be used in two ways first the small businesses such as grocery stores laundries clothing stores restaurants must be owned by black people on a collective basis second in areas which we dont own but in which we spend heavily we must use collective economic power to force changes which will benefit the total group this would entail wellplanned and wellcoordinated programs of boycotts selective buying and other such tactics africanamerican nationalism regards such programs as powerful weapons in the struggle for liberation educationally africanamerican nationalism demands that black people finance and support schools and centers which will be used to promote group identity among our children in these schools and centers the imagecreating process will be completely controlled by nationalistminded teachers authors artists and musicians who will use their talents to give the children the proper symbols and knowledge needed to maintain strong group identity history for instance will be taught as interpreted by trained and competent black historians in the already existing public schools africanamerican nationalism demands that black parents and black teachers use all means at their disposal to insure that the public schools in black communities are geared to the needs of the students of those communities internationally africanamerican nationalism demands that we attempt to create a sound working relationship with our counterparts in africa this relationship will be based not on a solely emotional basis but on a practical belief that the progress of the africanamerican will ultimately help the africans and that as brother malcolm once said a strong and united africa will be a protection for black people everywhere africanamerican nationalism demands that we give our wholehearted support to the true african nationalists who are fighting to gain control of their continent it demands that we promote the cause of african nationalism in this country we must judge international events in terms of how they affect the cause of african nationalism finally africanamerican nationalism accepts the principle that our future wellbeing has to be based upon a strong relationship with africa and friendship with that portion of the colored world which offers friendship to us africanamerican nationalism is slowly increasing in strength among our people the espousers of group identity racial consciousness and black_power are all expressing a form of nationalism africanamerican nationalism is an ideology umbrella under which the human resources of our people can be utilized to insure group stability group progress and group security to me africanamerican nationalism is our only sure path to liberation during the last decade coinciding with the explosion of negro civil_rights movements into public consciousnessa number of negro playwrights have gained considerable notice louis peterson lorraine hansberry ossie davis james baldwin leroi jones and others collectors of awards and honors a few catapulted into international fame and dramatic prominence critical barometers and geiger counters whipped out to gauge possible winds trends and resulting fallout however this flurry of attention has tended to misrepresent the real status of negro playwrights despite an eminent handful negro dramatists remain sparse in number productions sporadic at most and scripts too few to indicate discernible trends last year during a forum on what negro playwrights are saying not even panel members could cite enough plays to make plural subject matter viable moreover even when deemed successfulthe critical and financial rewards reaped by a raisin in the sun excepted and on a smaller scale leroi joness dutchman few productions have managed to recoup capitalization no the millenium has not been reached many factors contribute to this situation but surveying the total landscape of american theater results could hardly be otherwise the legitimate theater that fabulous invalid which compared to its electronic bedpartner is still dreamed of as the repository of high culture and artistic achievement in america hardly qualifies when examined from a negro viewpoint tirelessly predictably almost repetitiously on cue theater critics and other jeremiahs deplore rampant commercialism the monopoly of escapist musicals the dominance of brittle frothy comedies and the inadequacy of experimental ventures they also leave the impression that a little minor surgery would work wonders that palliatives could restore health but the patient is sicker than even the most pessimistic diagnosis suggests no matter how severe their prognosis pundits seldom question the basic structures or assumptions of their theater with rare exceptionsan occasional native play of quality or intermittent foreign infusions american legit theater even at its most ambitious seriousness is essentially a theater of the bourgeois by the bourgeois about the bourgeois and for the bourgeois a pretentious theater elevating the narrow preoccupations of restricted class interests to inflated universal significance tacitly assuming that its middleclass affluentoriented absorptions are central to the dominant human condition a theater rarely embracing broader frames of reference or more inclusive concerns a theatereven if it triedincapable of engaging the attention of anyone not so fortunate as to possess a college diploma or fivefigure salary more specifically a theater in its loftymodern niche broadway offbroadway offoffbroadway happeningsland whereveroverwhelmingly riddled with works of ingroup concerns belleslettres pomposity instant despair stultifying boredom humorless humor hastypudding hijinks pseudoabsurdity and closetavant daring a theater of diversiona diversionary theater whose main problem is not that its too safe but that it is surpassingly irrelevant occasional productions of stature and significance must usually display a cachet of foreign authorship and reputation to justify presentation maybe this is all as it should be computer consensusas yet doesnt spawn meaningful plays the most powerful country in the western world doesnt necessarily usher in a golden age of drama it is not surprising that the negro playwright and the power of his potential fits only peripherally into this spectrum by his mere historical placement in american society the negro exists as a disturbing presence an embarrassment to majority comfort an actuality deflating pretenses an implicit witness and cogent critic too immediate for attention also just as in real life a black playwrightsight unseen play unheard is soothsayed as too bothersome a prod to the sleeping conscience of numerical superiors the stage establishment like hollywood consigns even the most innocuous negro subject matter to an ogrecategory of problem drama even sympathetic advisers constantly bug the dark craftsman to shun racial themes and aspire to that pantheon of olympian universality which all white playwrights ironically enough can enter by merely getting themselves born as one naive wellmeaning but frighteningly boorish scribe put itno longer negro playwright just playwright whoever heard of batting an eyelash of lowercaste condescension when sean ocasey is mentioned as an irish playwright that the negro playwright is more or less excluded from legit boulevards is not a revelation for concern more important is the fact that even when produced within this environment the very essence of his creative function is jeopardized his plays by a majority least equipped to understand his intentions woefully apathetic or anesthetized to his experience often prone to distort his purpose spectators who though afflicted with selfimposed ignorance demand to be taught abcs at the very moment when the writer is impatient to explore the algebra of his thematic equations observers even when most sympathetic whose attitudes have been repeatedly shaped by preconceptions and misconceptions warped by superficial cliches and platitudesliberal conservative or radical though they may be catering to such insistences presages barren results with imagination shortcircuited valuable time is wasted clueing in exposition is demanded when action should be unfolding the obvious must be overillustrated and fantasy literalized finally when the curtain descends whether the writer has pampered illusions lectured ignorance comforted fears shouted for attention or flagellated consciences probability dictates his defeat and the victory of customerstriumphantly intact in their limitations with tears dried the shouting quieted or the aches of the catoninetails subsided the writer has been neatly appropriated usurped his creativity subvertedfor those negro playwrights eager to volunteer for this function theres no advice to offer they know the rules they play the game and take their chances but for a negro playwright committed to examining the contours contexts and depths of his experiences from an unfretted imaginative negro angle of vision the screaming need is for a sufficient audience of other negroes better informed through commonly shared experience to readily understand debate confirm or reject the truth or falsity of his creative explorations not necessarily an allblack audience to the exclusion of whites but for the playwright certainly his primary audience the first persons of his address potentially the most advanced the most responsive or most critical only through their initial and continuous participation can his intent and purpose be best perceived by others the validity of this premise has been borne out previously in other productions and most recently during the current run of my own plays happy ending and day of absence two works of satirical content written from an unapologetic negro viewpoint throughout the run negro attendance has averaged close to per cent hundreds witnessing a professional play for the first time besides contributing immeasurably to the longevity of the run the freshness of their response immediacy of in volvement and spontaneity of participation have significantly underscored the essence of the works themselves and provided crucial illuminations for others with negroes responding all around white spectators congenitally uneasy in the presence of negro satire at least cant fail to get the message any future hope for the negro playwright depends upon whether or not this minuscule singular alltoinfrequent experience can be extended multiplied and made permanent as long as the negro playwright remains totally dependent on existing outlets he stands to continue as a pauper begging sustenance never knowing from day to day year to year whether a few scraps will be tossed his way even burgeoning taxsupported privately endowed repertory companies are beyond the reach of his ambition imagine rushing to present day of absence or any other work which would require jobbingin negro actors when your roster only allows for two or three at mostoften tokens at that eventually an allembracing allencompassing theater of negro identity organized as an adjunct of some negro community might ideally solve the negro dramatists dilemma but such a development to memust arise as part of a massive effort to reconstruct the urban ghetto smallscale cultural islands in the midst of the ghettos separate and apart from a committed program of social and economic revitalization of slums are doomed to exotic isolation meanwhile potential talent ready for exercise cannot wait without engagement it lies dormant stillborn time passes aging proceeds the talent withers and eventually dies of nonuse if any hope outside of chance individual fortune exists for negro playwrights as a groupor for that matter negro actors and other theater craftsmenthe most immediate pressing practical absolutely minimally essential active first step is the development of a permanent negro repertory company of at least offbroadway size and dimension not in the future but now a theater evolving not out of negative need but positive potential better equipped to employ existing talents and spur the development of future ones a theater whose justification is not the gap it fills but the achievement it aspires towardno less high than any other comparable theater company of present or past world fame a theater concentrating primarily on themes of negro life but also resilient enough to incorporate and interpret the best of world dramawhatever the source a theater of permanence continuity and consistency providing the necessary home base for the negro artist to launch a campaign to win his ignored brothers and sisters as constant witnesses to his endeavors this is not a plea for either a segregated theater or a separatist one negroes constitute a numerical minority but negro experience from slavery to civil_rights has always been of crucial importance to americas existence theres no reason why whites could not participate in a theater dedicated to exploring and illuminating that experience if they found inspiration in the purpose also just as the intrusion of lower middleclass and workingclass voices reinvigorated polite effete english drama so might the negro a most potential agent of vitality infuse life into the moribund corpus of american theater one more river to cross by will henry is published by random house new york and sells for the subtitle is the life and legend of isom dart the author employs the biblical usage of changing a persons name after an extremely significant event occurs in his life ned huddleston is the name that this exslave uses through most of his life and he ends up being called isom dart this novel is ostensibly based on a western folk tale and the story is based on legendary events in the history of isom dart the notion of adding to the repertoire of american folk tales the story of a black man is an excellent idea certainly it is important to the american literary scene that this be done in that the main body of this countrys folklore displays a conspicuous absence of the contributions of the people of african ancestry parenthetically it would help if historians would stop camouflaging the racial origins of the many blacks who have made significant contributions and are disguised by these historians as white will henry has written a great many folk stories based on western legends and seems to know a great deal about living patterns in the west however he fails miserably in his attempt to portray isom dart as a heroic figure in fact a reading of this book makes one ask why he bothered to describe such a pitiful character his efforts are ludicrous when one realizes that he even intended to create a heroic figure maybe mr henry just could not believe the legend of isom dart as he has heard it and amended it to fit his own picture of a black man the author superficially portrays isom dart as a fierce and brave figure whose reputation strikes fear in the hearts of anyone who hears about him for miles around isom dart is realistically fearless and his horsemanship tracking and hunting ability is unequaled during the course of his life isom has to kill many mexicans and indians without any psychological problems however when confronted by an armed white southerner who disarms himself and whips isom with isoms whip all that mighty isom is able to do is to drop to his hands and knees not to strike back the white man left him there disdaining even to look back at him our hero isom stayed down once was not enough for our author there is a repeat performance in the last episode in the novel this time it is even better after tracking down a white man who has killed isoms beloved adopted halfbreed daughter and while facing the white villain with gun in hand it reads boy youre plain lucky the way things are now you understand me uncle im weary and wore down and i wont say it twice you go and get your horse and you get on him and you get the hell over the river yonder and you keep going rash the white man was not wearing a gun he waited upon the will of isom dart and waited but isom did not strike yes suh said the tall negro and turned away perhaps the authors basic problem can be traced to a statement made early in the story when isom then called ned is trying to plot his future course he recalls his childhood in his musing the author puts these words in his mind ned reared in kindness and treated decently all his boyhood life if will henry can conceive of a slave being treated kindly and decently then he is in bad shape as an author who intends to portray an authentic human being words like these cannot even be thought of when one is attempting to describe the tragic and despicable lot of a black slave of a white man in conclusion mr henry had better stick to writing about white heroes and leave the dramatization of blacks to blacks before he was killed in colombia last year the catholic priest camilo torres admonished his countrymen who at least in pose shared his religious affiliationthat not one of them who was not on the side of the people who was not in essence involved in the revolution against the rulers could rightly consider himself catholic i think while not attempting a definition of what catholic in fact is that the catholicism of camilo torres as an expression of his religion obtained a special relation to man as a being it was of course precisely that relationship to man that placed him at odds with and indeed made him an enemy of the state torres religion was the religion of john brown nat turner and malcolm_xand others whose destruction was essential to the prolongation of state over man but the religion of torres and i think this can be said empirically as well as sensed was not a religion shared by very many catholic priests in these united states thomas merton perhaps freedom from domination freedom to live ones own spiritual life freedom to seek the highest truth unabashed by any human pressure or any collective demand the ability to say ones own yes and ones own no and not merely to echo the yes and the no of state party corporation army or system this is inseparable from authentic religion writes trappist monk merton in conjectures of a guilty bystander doubleday commenting on his work merton tell us maybe the best way to characterize this book is to say that it consists of a series of sketches and meditations some poetic and literary others historical and even theological fitted together in a spontaneous informal philosophic scheme in such a way that they react upon each other the slightly erratic structure of the book with its five separate parts into which many of the authors conjectures could as easily have fallen into one parts as they did seemingly fall into another keeps pace with that statement but the value of mertons christian reflections is in no way lessened by the fact that one occasionally loses patiencethe title of his book is no abstractionwith the lack of continuity merton is among the truly educated men of our time not in the narrow american sense meaning one who in becoming technically efficient took from a few courses in the humanities a superficial familiarity that might be used not unlike playing the piano as a social grace that elan of love the frenchman gabon insisted must be aroused if education is to have purpose is alive in merton or closer to home kenneth b clark suggested in the american scholar that in the training of human beings we must find some way to give them the assurance to love the security to be kind and the intergrity required for a functional empathy did he say mankind needs not more bombs but more mertonsthis rare noncolored man in whom the western assumption to know gives way to the educational imperative to think thomas merton is free of the american madness a letter arrives from some woman in france a total stranger evidently an ardent catholic asks me for the prayers of the monks of gethsemani that america may at last start a nuclear crusade against russia and draw all the fearful pusillanimous western nations with her into it all this in the name of religion christian and serious we cannot stand it any longer she said i wonder that god can stand it no network would have broadcast the merton report on the evening of november it would have been too sane the country is undergoing a real emotional crisis all the more so as oswald suspected of shooting kennedy has now been shot himself by a superpatriot a curious impulsive type a nightclub owner the whole thing is so odd it is barely credible or seven days later the whole question of the kennedy assassination is extremely complex and obscure but now everybody wants it to be settled and settled it is all have agreed on the answer the general justice is satisfied one feels that all have wanted a solution at any price and have taken the first one that was at hand is it good enough the perceptive merton discovers even in the monastery the kind of power struggle over absurdities that make life on this planet a satire he notes that there are people playing politics over whether the hoods should be up or down when the monks are listening to reading in the refractory and other little proprieties that mean nothing it is a question says merton of who shall have the last word who is boss in the end this kind of nonsense produces luthers or would do so if we had anyone around capable of becoming a luther fortunately we are all too stupid or too lazy it was merton who said in his book seeds of destruction most of us are congenitally unable to think black and yet that is precisely what we must do before we can even hope to understand the crisis in which we find ourselves furthermore we do not bother really to listen to what the negro says because we assume that when the dialogue really begins he will already be thinking just like ourselves the white jesus weve known so well could never issue a conjecture this honest the negro is clearly invited to one response he has had untold reasons for hating the white man they are now being solidly compounded and confirmed even though he has nothing whatever to gain by violence he has also nothing to lose and violence will at least be one decisive way of saying what he thinks of white society the result is likely to be very unpleasant and the blame will rest squarely on the shoulders of white america with its emotional cultural and political immaturity and its pitiable refusal of insight merton who considers himself neither conservative nor an extreme progressive is a man who sees and feels a man in whom the pragmatic question of the politiciancan we winis at all times subjected to the poets questioncan we be more fully human one cannot in reviewing this book say that it is good or bad or great it is a joy it might be said of merton as truman nelson has written of thoreauwhose affinity to nature lives on in merton that he has come to realize that there is an exalted form of individualism which merges into universality and becomes one with it i am tempted to think writes merton rather introspectively that the complexities of our own cenobitic system hem one in with arbitrary fantasies keep one in an absurd corner for the sake of some obscure principle or other some point of ideology in such a case to do what is really right one has to go at it backward as if he were doing something else as the soulful sncc folks say cmon way from there babydavid lloren and promises to keep the southern conference for human welfare vanderbilt university press is a very exhaustive historical work that traces the most liberal efforts on the part of southerners to reform their society the author thomas a krueger went to great lengths to document this liberal group the southern conference for human welfare through its brief years of life it is interesting to note the lengths to which the conservative south was willing to go in order to preserve its way of life in terms of the obvious social problems in the south this group did relatively little to solve these problems it tried valiantly and maybe in years to come history will tell what it did accomplish but the outstanding message of this book is that this group apparently did relatively nothing it was labeled out of existence with such titles as communist and radical the only consistent following it seemed to have were negroes which as the author points out did not help its image it is a duplication of an old story white people apparently are not going to do what is right just because they feel they should and an appeal from this perspective is futile this work is clear and objective however the same question could have been asked of the southern conference for human welfare as could be asked of the author why bother a year ago dodd mead company published a book which received little notice but which should have considerable interest for those interested in black writers in general and in the harlem renaissance in particular the book was countee cullen and the negro renaissance by blanche e ferguson the book has characteristics of both a travelogue and a memoir much of the space is devoted to the poet cullens visit to europe and the holy land in the early twenties and of his long stay in paris under the auspices of a fellowship for the older generation there is the pleasure of recognition of the names and personalities who black and white influenced the black world in the period between the first world war and the end of the second one not many of the people remain alive today but a few of them doarna bontemps sterling a brown and saunders redding among them in a way countee cullen lived a gilded life in a gilded age his was not the hard brutal life endured by so many of his generation and he spent all of his life in the north for the younger generation the book provides an opportunity to gain an insight into a muchdiscussed and apparently overrated time the period the harlem renaissance however the young reader should be warned that the time and its people should be seen in the context of the world and history and should not be judged by todays yardstick the christian role in todays society by the right reverend monsignor george a kelley is published by random house and is priced at it is written by a man who has had a great many valuable experiences but it is like locking the barn after the horses have escaped the society that he calls todays sounds like society must have been at the turn of the century he symptomatically treats the issues of our culture his basic premise is that things are bad but he feels that if people would do what is right all of the problems will be alleviated for instance he very astutely describes the evils of segregation and discrimination however he sees the solution as arriving when white people stop doing mean things like that there is no prophetic proclamation that evil has its rewards he never deals with the question of the decay that these segregating people have already engendered he not only seems to be writing just to white people but he is also only writing to roman catholics his ideas are laced with roman catholic jargon and he very clearly assumes a double standard ordinary people behave one way while roman catholics another the book might more aptly have been titled the catholic role in yesterdays society a quote from the book that bears these ideas out a hundred years ago what the majority of the population thought did not affect catholics they were in a minority these catholics were able to lead good christian lives without concerning themselves with problems beyond their own communities by remaining in close relationship one with the other they could and did live good and holy lives were they indeed good and holy while they condoned slavery worked little children justified colonizing the world treated women like dogs etc the point is foolish to argue that people are different now from what they once were like is ridiculous the fact is that environmental conditions change and therefore the potential contributions of people during each era are different another anachronism in this work is that the author is utilizing four teenth century catechismal didacticism he tells people what they are supposed to do this attitude is revealed in the title he says the christian role when if he were aware of any of the theological developments of the twentieth century he surely would have titled his book the christians role there could not be only one christian role yet he because of his title and his book seems to believe just that unlike monsignor kelley many of us have never believed in this good christian culture that he fears we are dangerously close to losing to many of us it has been too long in dying so that maybe we can now build a brotherhood of this world not just of the roman catholic churchmacfadden books has published a cheap cents paperback student edition of africa in the united states which is very much a bargain the book is edited by vernon mckay who also contributed a chapter american interest in africa in an introduction to the book mr mckay writes that the symposium is designed to illustrate the rich plurality of american interests in africa and its future it does not tell the story of africa itself but focuses on the remarkable work of africa being done in the united states by thousands of americans through their government their civic organizations their schools and churches their philanthropic foundations their art museums and music centers and through other institutions to this end such articles are included as the image of africa in the united states by the late melville j herskovits african students in the united states by the house subcommittee on africa and us government programs on africa within the united states by fred l hadsel there is an interesting article on the influence of africans on american culture by john a davis former head of the american society of african culture dr davis comments on the historical alliances and associations between africans and afroamericans and makes some statements relative to the contemporary status of relationships between the two groups probably the most useful article in the book is adelaide cromwell hills consideration of african studies programs in the united states dr hill currently a research associate in the african studies program at smith college provides a reasonably comprehensive rundown on african studies programs which could serve admirably as a guide for anyone interested in such programs a buy well worth the money africans were great story tellers long before their first appearance in jamestown virginia in the rich and colorful history art and folklore of west africa the ancestral home of most afroamericans present evidence of this and more contrary to a misconception which still prevails the africans were familiar with literature and art for many years before their contact with the western world before the breaking up of the social structure of the west african states of ghana melle mali and songhay and the internal strife and chaos that made the slave trade possible the forefathers of the africans who eventually became slaves in the united states lived in a society where university life was fairly common and scholars were beheld with reverence there were in this ancestry rulers who expanded their kingdoms into empires great and magnificent armies whose physical dimensions dwarfed entire nations into submission generals who advanced the technique of military science scholars whose vision of life showed foresight and wisdom and priests who told of gods that were strong and kind to understand fully any aspect of afroamerican life one must realize that the black american is not without a cultural past though he was many generations removed from it before his achievements in american literature and art commanded any appreciable attention i have been referring to the african origin of afroamerican literature and history this preface is essential to every meaningful discussion of the role of the afroamerican in every major aspect of american life past and present before getting into the main body of this talk i want to make it clear that the black race did not come to the united states culturally emptyhanded i will elaborate very briefly on my statement to the effect that the forefathers of the africans who eventually became slaves in the united states once lived in a society where university life was fairly common and scholars were beheld with reverence during the period in west african historyfrom the early part of the fourteenth century to the time of the moorish invasion in the city of timbuktu with the university of sankore in the songhay empire was the intellectual center of africa black scholars were enjoying a renaissance that was known and respected throughout most of africa and in parts of europe at this period in african history the university of sankore at timbuktu was the educational capital of the western sudan in his book timbuktu the mysterious felix dubois gives us the following description of this period the scholars of timbuktu yielded in nothing to the saints in their sojourns in the foreign universities of fez tunis and cairo they astounded the most learned men of islam by their erudition that these negroes were on a level with the arabian savants is proved by the fact that they were installed as professors in morocco and egypt in contrast to this we find that the arabs were not always equal to the requirements of sankore i will speak of only one of the great black scholars referred to in the book by felix dubois ahmed baba was the last chancellor of the university of sankore he was one of the greatest african scholars of the late sixteenth century his life is a brilliant example of the range and depth of west african intellectual activity before the colonial era ahmed baba was the author of more than books nearly every one of these books had a different theme he was in timbuktu when it was invaded by the moroccans in and he was one of the first citizens to protest this occupation of his beloved home town ahmed baba along with other scholars was imprisoned and eventually exiled to morocco during his expatriation from timbuktu his collection of books one of the richest libraries of his day was lost now west africa entered a sad period of decline during the moorish occupation wreck and ruin became the order of the day when the europeans arrived in this part of africa and saw these conditions they assumed that nothing of order and value had ever existed in these countries this mistaken impression too often repeated has influenced the interpretation of african and afroamerican life in history for over years years negroes played an important part in american life history and culture long before our relationship to this country is as old as the country itself africans first came to the new world as explorers they participated in the exploratory expeditions of balboa the discoverer of the pacific and cortes the conqueror of mexico an african explorer helped to open up new mexico and arizona and prepared the way for the settlement of the southwest africans also accompanied french jesuit missionaries on their early travels through north america in the united states the art and literature of the negro people has had an economic origin much that is original in black american folklore or singular in negro spirituals and blues can be traced to the economic institution of slavery and its influence upon the negros soul after the initial poetical debut of jupiter hammon and phillis wheatley the main literary expression of the negro was the slave narrative one of the earliest of these narratives came from the pen of gustavas vassa an african from nigeria this was a time of great pamphleteering in the united states the free africans in the north and those who had escaped from slavery in the south made their mark upon this time and awakened the conscience of the nation their lack of formal educational attainments gave their narratives a strong and roughhewed truth more arresting than scholarship gustavas vassa established his reputation with an autobiography first printed in england vassa born in was kidnapped by slavers when he was years old and taken to america he was placed in service on a plantation in virginia eventually he was able to purchase his freedom he left the united states made his home in england and became active in the british antislavery movement in he presented a petition to parliament to abolish the slave trade his autobiography the interesting narrative of the life of gustavas vassa was an immediate success and had to be published in five editions at the time when slave ships were still transporting africans to the new world two th century negroes were writing and publishing works of poetry the first of these was jupiter hammon a slave in queens village long island in hammon published an evening thought salvation by christ with penitential cries in all probability this was the first poem published by an american negro his most remarkable work an address to the negroes of new york was published in jupiter hammon died in phillis wheatley like hammon was influenced by the religious forces of wesleywhitefield revival unlike hammon however she was a writer of unusual talent though born in africa she acquired in an uncredibly short time both the literary culture and the religion of her new england masters her writings reflect little of her race and much of the age in which she lived she was a new england poet of the third quarter of the th century and her poems reflected the poetic conventions of the boston puritans with whom she lived her fame continued long after her death in and she became one of the best known poets of new england another important body of literature came out of this period it is the literature of petition written by free black men in the north who were free in name only some of the early petitioners for justice were caribbeanamericans who saw their plight and the plight of the afroamericans as one and the a same in th century america two of the most outstanding fighters for liberty and justice were the west indiansprince hall and john b russwurm when prince hall came to the united states the nation was in turmoil the colonies were ablaze with indignation britain with a series of revenue acts had stoked the fires of colonial discontent in virginia patrick henry was speaking of liberty or death the cry no taxation without representation played on the nerve strings of the nation prince hall then a delicatelooking teenager often walked through the turbulent streets of boston an observer unobserved a few months before these hectic scenes he had arrived in the united states from his home in barbados where he was born about the son of an englishman and a free african woman he was in theory a free man but he knew that neither in boston nor in barbados were persons of african descent free in fact at once he questioned the sincerity of the vocal white patriots of boston it never seemed to have occurred to them that the announced principles motivating their action was stronger argument in favor of destroying the system of slavery the colonists held in servitude more than a half million human beings some of them white yet they engaged in the contradiction of going to war to support the theory that all men were created equal when prince hall arrived in boston that city was the center of the american slave trade most of the major leaders of revolutionary movement in fact were slaveholders or investors in slavesupported businesses hall like many other americans wondered what did these men mean by freedom the condition of the free black men as prince hall found them was not an enviable one emancipation brought neither freedom nor relief from the stigma of color they were still included with slaves indentured servants and indians in the slave codes discriminatory laws severely circumscribed their freedom of movement by prince hall saw little change in the condition of the blacks and though a freeman at least in theory he saw his people debased as though they were slaves still in bondage these things drove him to prepare himself for leadership among his people so through diligence and frugality he became a property owner thus establishing himself in the eyes of white people as well as the blacks but the ownership of property was not enough he still had to endure sneers and insults he went to school at night and later became a methodist preacher his church became the forum for his peoples grievances ten years after his arrival in boston he was the accepted leader of the black community in hall petitioned the massachusetts legislature protesting the kidnapping of free negroes this was a time when american patriots were engaged in a constitutional struggle for freedom they had proclaimed the inherent rights of all mankind to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness hall dared to remind them that the black men in the united states were human beings and as such were entitled to freedom and respect for their human personality prejudice made hall the father of african secret societies in the united states he is the father of what is now known as negro masonry hall first sought initiation into the white masonic lodge in boston but was turned down because of his color he then applied to the army lodge of an irish regiment his petition was favorably received on march hall and fourteen other black americans were initiated in lodge number when on march the british were forced to evacuate boston the army lodge gave prince hall and his colleagues a license to meet and function as a lodge thus on july african lodge no came into being this was the first lodge in masonry established in america for men of african descent the founding of the african lodge was one of prince halls greatest achievements it afforded the africans in the new england area a greater sense of security and contributed to a new spirit of unity among them halls interest did not end with the lodge he was deeply concerned with improving the lot of his people in other ways he sought to have schools established for the children of the free africans in massachusetts of prime importance is the fact that prince hall worked to secure respect for the personality of his people and also played a significant role in the downfall of the massachusetts slave trade he helped to prepare the groundwork for the freedom fighters of the th and th centuries whose continuing efforts have brought the black american closer to the goal of full citizenship the literature of petition was continued by men like david walker whose appeal an indictment of slavery was published in dynamic ministers like samuel ringgold ward and henry highland garnet joined the ranks of the petitioners at the time a journalist literature was being born frederick douglass the noblest of american black men of the th century was the leader of the journalist group he established the newspaper north star and later the magazine douglass monthly john b russwurm and samuel cornish founded the newspaper freedoms journal in in a third poet george moses horton published his book the hope of liberty in his second volume naked genius he expressed his antislavery convictions more clearly george moses horton was the first slave poet to openly protest his status throughout the early part of the m th century the slave narrative became a new form of american literary expression the best known of these slave narratives came from the pen of frederick douglass the foremost negro in the antislavery movement his first book was the narrative of the life of frederick douglass ten years later an improved and enlarged edition my bondage and my freedom was published his third autobiography life and times of frederick douglass was published in and enlarged in douglass fought for civil_rights and against lynching and the ku klux klan no abuse of justice escaped his attention and his wrath it was not until that an afroamerican writer emerged who was fully a master of the short story as a literary form this writer was charles w chesnutt chesnutt an ohioan by birth became a teacher in north carolina while still in his middle teens he studied the traditions and superstitions of the people that he taught and later made this material into the ingredient of his best short stories in august his short story the goophered grapevine appeared in the atlantic monthly this was the beginning of a series of stories which were later brought together in his first book the conjure woman the wife of his youth also appeared in the atlantic july and gave the title to his second volume the wife of his youth and other stories of the color line three more stories appeared later baxters procrustes in the atlantic june and the doll and mr taylors funeral in the crisis magazine april and aprilmay chesnutts novel did not measure up to the standards he had set with his short stories though they were all competently written in he was awarded the spingarn medal for his pioneer work as a literary artist depicting the life and struggle of americans of negro descent paul laurence dunbar a contemporary of charles w chesnutt made his reputation as a poet before extending his talent to short stories both dunbar and chesnutt very often used the same subject matter in their stories chesnutt was by far the better writer and his style and attitude differed radically from dunbars dunbars pleasant folk tales of traditionbound plantation black folk were more acceptable to a large white reading audience with preconceived ideas of negro characteristics in all fairness it must be said that dunbar did not cater to this audience in all of his stories in such stories as the tragedy at three forks the lynching of jube benson and the ordeal of mt hope he showed a deep concern and understanding of the more serious and troublesome aspects of afroamerican life collections of his stories are folks from dixie the strength of gideon in old plantation days and the heart of happy hollow only one of his novels the sport of the gods is mainly concerned with afroamerican characters chesnutt and dunbar in their day reached a larger general reading audience than any of the black writers who came before them the period of the slave narratives had passed yet the black writer was still an oddity and a stepchild in the eyes of most critics this attitude continued in a lessening degree throughout one of the richest and most productive periods in afroamerican writing in the united statesthe period called the negro renaissance the community of harlem was the center and spiritual godfather and midwife for this renaissance the cultural emancipation of the afroamerican that began before the first world war was now in full force the black writer discovered a new voice within himself and liked the sound of it the white writers who had been interpreting our life with an air of authority and a preponderance of error looked at last to the black writer for their next cue in short story collections like jean toomers cane and langston hughes the ways of white folks heretofore untreated aspects of afroamerican life were presented in an interesting manner that was unreal to some readers because it was new and so contrary to the stereotypes they had grown accustomed to in her book mules and men zora neal hurston presented a collection of folk tales and sketches that showed the close relationship between humor and tragedy in afroamerican life in doing this she also fulfilled the first requirement of all booksto entertain and guide the reader through an interesting experience that is worth the time and attention it takes to absorb it in other stories like the gilded six bits drenched in light and spunk another side of miss hurstons talent was shown in the midst of this renaissance two strong voices from the west indians were heard claude mckay in his books gingertown and banana bottom wrote of life in his jamaican homeland in a manner that debunked the travelogue exoticism usually attributed to negro life in the caribbean area before the publication of these books harlem and its inhabitants had already been the subject matter for a group of remarkable short stories by mckay and the inspira tion for his book home to harlem still the most famous novel ever written about that community in eric walrond a native of british guiana explored and presented another side of west indian life in his book tropic death a near classic in these naturalistic stories eric walrond concerns himself mostly with labor and living conditions in the panama canal zone where a diversity of people and ways of life meet and clash while each tries to survive at the expense of the other clear perception and strength of style enabled mr walrond to balance form and content in such a manner that the message was never intruded upon the unfolding of the stories rudolph fisher another bright star of the harlem literary renaissance was first a brilliant young doctor the new and light touch he brought to his stories of afroamerican life did not mar the serious aspect that was always present the message in his comic realism was more profound because he was skillful enough to weave it into the design of his stories without destroying any of their entertainment value his stories blades of steel the city of refuge and the promised land were published in the atlantic monthly high yaller appeared in the crisis magazine during the heyday of that publication and was later reprinted in the obrien anthology best short stories of unfortunately he died before all of his bright promise was fulfilled the harlem literary renaissance was studded with many names those already mentioned are only a few of the most outstanding during the period of this literary flowering among black writers harlem became the mecca the stimulating holy city drawing pilgrims from all over the country and from some places abroad talented authors playwrights painters and sculptors came forth eagerly showing their wares three men w e b du bois james weldon johnson and alain locke cast a guiding influence over this movement without becoming a part of the social climbing and pseudointellectual aspect of it w e b du bois by continuously challenging the old concepts and misinterpretations of afroamerican life gave enlightened new directions to a whole generation as editor of the crisis he introduced many new black writers and extended his helpful and disciplining hand when it was needed following the death of booker t washington and the decline of the booker t washington school of thought he became the spiritual father of the new black intelligentsia james weldon johnson moved from florida to new york his diversity of talent established his reputation long before the beginning of the new negro literary movement later as a participant in and historian of the movement he helped to appraise and preserve the best that came out of it in his books autobiography of an excolored man the book of a merican negro poetry black manhattan and along this way an autobiography james weldon johnson showed clearly that negro writers have made a distinct contribution to the literature of the united states his own creative talent made him one of the most able of these contributors alain locke is the writer who devoted the most time to the interpretation of the new negro literary movement and to afroamerican literature in general in he expanded the special t harlem issue of the magazine survey graphic which he edited into the anthology the new negro this book is a milestone and a guide to afroamerican thought literature and art in the middle twenties the objective of the volume to register the transformation of the inner and outer life of the negro in america that had so significantly taken place in the last few preceding years was ably achieved for many years mr lockes annual appraisal of books by and about negroes published in opportunity magazine was an eagerly awaited literary event early in the harlem literary renaissance period the black ghetto became an attraction for a varied assortment of white celebrities and just plain thrillseeking white people lost from their moorings some were insipid rebels defying the mores of their upbringing by associating with negroes on a socially equal level some were too rich to work not educated enough to teach and not holy enough to preach others were searching for the mythological noble savage the exotic negro these professional exotics were generally college educated negroes who had become estranged from their families and the environment of their upbringing they talked at length about the great books within them waiting to be written their white sponsors continued to subsidize them while they developed their latent talent of course the great books of these camp followers never got written and eventually their white sponsors realized that they were never going to writenot even a good letter ironically these sophisticates made a definite contribution to the period of the new negro literary renaissance in socially inclined company they proved that a black american could behave with as much attention to the details of social protocol as the best bred and richest white person in the country they could balance a cocktail glass with expertness behind their prem tense of being writers they were really actorsand rather good ones they were generally better informed than their white sponsors and could easily participate in a discussion of the writings of marcel proust in one minute and the music of ludwig von beethoven the next as social parasites they conducted themselves with a smoothness approaching an artistic accomplishment unknown to them their conduct had done much to eliminate one of the major prevailing stereotypes of afroamerican life and manners concurrently with the unfolding of this mildly funny comedy the greatest productive period in afroamerican literature continued the more serious and talented black writers were actually writing their books and getting them published opportunity magazine then edited by charles johnson and the crisis edited by w e b du bois were the major outlets for the new black writers opportunity short story contests provided a proving ground for a number of competent black writers among the prize winners were cecil blue john f matheus eugene gordon and marita bonner writers like walter white jessie fauset wallace thurman nella larsen george s schuyler sterling a brown and arna bontemps had already made their debut and were accepted into the circle of the matured the stock market collapse of marked the beginning of the depression and the end of the period known as the negro renaissance the exotic negro professional and otherwise became less exotic now that a hungry look was upon his face the numerous white sponsors and wellwishers who had begun to flock to harlem ten years before no longer had time or money to explore and marvel over harlem life many harlem residents lived and died in harlem during this period without once hearing of the famous literary movement that had flourished and declined within their midst it was not a mass movement it was a fad partly produced in harlem and partly imposed on harlem most of the writers associated with it would have written just as well at any other time in the intervening years between the end of the negro renaissance and the emergence of richard wright black writers of genuine talent continued to produce books of good caliber the lack of sponsorship and pampering had made them take serious stock of themselves and their intentions the crisis organ of the national association for the advancement of colored people and opportunity organ of the national urban league continued to furnish a publishing outlet for new black writers the general magazines published stories by black writers intermittently seemingly on a quota basis during this period writers like ralph ellison henry b jones marian minus ted poston lawrence d reddick and grace w thompkins published their first short stories in richard wrights first short story to receive any appreciable attention big boy leaves home appeared in the anthology the new caravan the ethics of living jim crow an autobiographical sketch was published in american stuff anthology of the federal writers project the next year in when his first book uncle toms children won a prize contest conducted by story magazine his talent received national attention with the publication of his phenomenally successful novel native son in a new era in afroamerican literature had begun here at last was a black writer who undeniably wrote considerably better than many of his white contemporaries as a short story craftsman he was the most accomplished black writer since charles w chesnutt after the emergence of richard wright the period of indulgence for negro writers was over hereafter black writers had to stand or fall by the same standards and judgments used to evaluate the work of white writers the era of the patronized and pampered black writer had at last come to an end the closing of this era may in the final analysis be the greatest contribution richard wright made to the status of negro writers and to negro literature when the united states entered the second world war the active negro writers like most other writers in the country turned their talents to some activity in relation to the war the first short stories of ann petry began to appear in the crisis the negro caravan the best anthology of negro literature since alain locke edited the new negro sixteen years before had already appeared with much new material chester b himes a dependable writer during the depression period managed to turn out a number of remarkable short stories while working in shipyards and war industries in california in he received a rosenwald fellowship to complete his first novel if he hollers let him go in frank yerby won an o henry memorial award for his excellent short story health card which had been published in harpers magazine a year before a new crop of postwar black writers was emerging in their stories they treated new aspects of afroamerican life or brought new insights to the old aspects principally they were good story tellers aside from any message they wanted to get across to their readers the weepy sociological propaganda stories so prevalent during the de pression era had had their day with the negro writer and all others there would still be protest stories but the protest would now have to meet the standards of living literature opportunity and the crisis once the proving ground for so many new black writers were no longer performing that much needed service the best of the new writers found acceptance in the general magazines among these are james baldwin lloyd brown arthur p davis owen dodson lance jeffers john o killens robert h lucas albert murray george e norford carl r offord john h robinson jr john caswell smith jr and mary e vroman with the rise of nationalism and independent states in africa and the rapid change of the status of the negro in the united states the material used by black writers and their treatment of it did of necessity reflect a breaking away from the old mooring among black writers the period of the s was the period of richard wright the period of the s was the period of james baldwin the now flourishing literary talent of james baldwin had no easy birth and he did not emerge overnight as some of his new discoverers would have you believe for years this talent was in incubation in the ghetto of harlem before he went to europe a decade ago in an attempt to discover the united states and how he and his people relate to it the book in which that discovery is portrayed the fire next time is a continuation of his search for place and definition baldwin more than any other writer of our times has succeeded in restoring the personal essay to its place as a form of creative literature from his narrow vantage point of personal grievance he has opened a window on the world he plays the role traditionally assigned to thinkers concerned with the improvement of human conditionsthat of alarmist he calls national attention to things in the society that need to be corrected and things that need to be celebrated when richard wright died in paris in a new generation of black writers partly influenced by him was beginning to explore as ralph ellison said the full range of american negro humanity in the short stories and novels of such writers as frank london brown william melvin kelly leroi jones paule marshall rosa guy and ernest j gaines both a new dimension and a new direction in writing is seen they have questioned and challenged all previous interpretations of afroamerican life in doing this they have created the basis for a new american literature the black writer and his people are now standing at the crossroads of history this is the black writers special vantage point and this is what makes the task and the mission of the black writer distinctly different from that of the white writer the black writer concerned with creating a work of art in a segregated society has a double task first he has to explain the society to himself and create his art while opposing that society second he cannot be honest with himself or his people without lending his support at least verbally to the making of a new society that respects the dignity of men the black writer must realize that his people are now entering the last phase of a transitional period between slavery and freedom it is time for the black writer tos draw upon the universal values in his peoples experience just as sean ocasey and sholem aleichem drew upon the universal values in the experiences of the irish and the jews in the next phase of afroamerican writing a literature of celebration must be created not a celebration of oppression but a celebration of survival in spite of it carrie mae her c mothers voice sound ed hurried as she en

nother pair of these instead the girl sighed tossing the pants over a chair my its sure warm she rubbed her arms across her face the color of light brown cinnamon it was late july and hot carrie mae

comon chile and quit fooling with that boy mama urged impatiently ah done tolt you that man acts in a powful hurry mama and the girl walked out onto the porch blinking in the brash sharp light the porch sagged deeply in the center where the boards were rottening faster than the others carrie mae stepped carefully walking gingerly down the steps mindful of not getting a rusty nail caught in her foot the man was waiting in the sun beside an old black ford coupe rustied by weather and streaked with the everlasting mississippi mud he was tall and lean trim looking in a keen edged way he wore khaki pants imprinted darkly down the sides from wiping sweaty hands his upper torso was bare showing a hairy suntanned chest almost her natural color a baseball cap jauntily brimmed his eyes pulled low shading a high bridged nose he was smoking and restlessly scraping the ground with his foot absently covering two already smoked butts with dust ahm ready suh she said coming beside him he wheeled quickly dropping the cigarette and stomping it with the others when he shoved his cap back she noticed his hair was a whitish blonde and his eyes were a pale blinding blue not seeming to register anything at all but still piercing sharply through her git in he muttered opening the door and sliding in on the drivers side she hesitated seeing the back seat was torn out and just the skeleton springs remained to prove it had once been there git in ah said he repeated roughly frowning impatiently at her she climbed in beside him and closed the door the car started off quickly jerking unevenly with each gear shift she kept her neck twisted smiling back at the two forms growing smaller and smaller and at the lopsided shack fading in the distance the man drove silently toward the main highway careening down the narrow dirt road steering with one hand as he fumbled in his trouser pocket and extracted a crumpled pack of camels with a small tarnished silver pocket lighter he applied flame to the cigarette inhaling deeply she huddled closer to the window trying to escape the smoke fumes but instead breathing in the dust from the road she felt perspiration begin to flow warmly down her body embarrassed she pushed her arms tightly against her sides hoping the gesture would stop the rivulets this was the first time she was to take care of his children and she didnt want him to think her unclean but it was so hot especially sitting on this side facing the sun the back road ended at the stop sign clumsily he scraped the gears his hand brushing her knee the road he turned on was paved and fringed with scattered old farm houses not far now he said interrupting the long silence narrowing his eyes at her he continued slowly ah hear you a pretty good babysitter carrie mae least thats what mista gordy says she smiled proudly mister gordy was rich and important and didnt let everybody keep his children ah takes care of mista gordys chillen the best way ah know how mista will mama always says if anythings worth doing its worth doing right he didnt say anymore just stared at the road cigarette hanging from his mouth his face appeared preoccupied immobile except for his squinting occasionally when smoke got in his eyes she wondered about his children their ages whether they were hard to keep or nice as the gordys pretty gal like you go to school he asked abruptly yes suh ahm in the seventh grade she was a little ashamed knowing she ought to be going to the county high school but when cotton picking time came the colored children had to work in the fields and school closed the cigarette was down to the mans lips now he threw it out the window and reached in his pocket again for the pack finding it empty he threw it out too the car reached the towns entrance and screeched to a stop at the red light when the light turned green his hand brushed her knee like before feeling hot and prickly to her flesh she moved without seeming to move closer to the door believing she was in the way as if he had forgotten the turn he wheeled the car roughly off the main highway to a dirt road amidst screeching brakes and burning rubber she was thrown against him her body touched the strong muscle of his arm which seemed to tighten at the contact and she caught the pungent sweaty odor of him mixed with a strange sour apple smell resembling the homemade wine mama served company at christmas time she slid quickly over in her corner hoping he wasnt mad halfexpecting a sharp rebuke white folks here didnt like colored to get too near them she knew that by the colored and white signs that were in town the signs their preacher said shouldnt be there anymorebut they were it was something for her to be sitting here on the front seat with him the reason she knew because there wasnt any back seat without looking directly at him she saw he was breathing hard his chest moving in and out like he had been running too fast he pressed harder on the gas and the car sped faster past the corn fields sweltering in the sun blaze and on until snarling brush weeds and tall cool trees took up where the fields ended finally he jerked to a stop in front of a decrepit white onestory frame house needing paint cardboard venetian blinds hung crookedly covering the front windows while faded green shutters sagged weakly from their hinges git out he said tautly as if something had caught in his throat he started up the pebbled path his naked brown back sweat glistening in the sun she followed slowly avoiding the decapitated doll whose face was inches away from the crushed body inside the living room was dimly obscured by the drawn blinds a greasy bacon smell permeated the housethe thick kind brought on from too hurried frying with the house closed the room was small burdened with a crushed red horse hair sofa matching chair and scarred walnut coffee table her eyes rested on a picture of a fat smiling stringy haired woman holding a baby while a small boy tugged at her dress christ the man breathed taking off his cap and throwing it on a chair its hottern hell but he made no effort to open the windows or doors he went through the narrow doorway into the kitchen from where she stood she could see him opening the icebox and taking out a bottle of beer she scarcely moved until he called comon out here soundlessly she went into the kitchen here the smell was stronger soiled dishes with coagulated yellow egg and hardened white grease stains were piled in the sink a babys high chair was beside the table freckled with dried pablum she felt the man watching her closely as he sucked thirstily on the beer cold sweat ran down the bottles sides the coldness made her more conscious of the heat and dust still peppering her throat she wanted a glass of water but custom and habit made her keep silent my wife didnt have no time to clean up before she left he said motioning she wondered if he expected her to if so maybe she could get more money aunt died in the city he went on flatly she felt rooted to the spot as perspiration dampened her face a surging inadequate wave swept over her causing her to feel young and unwittingly helpless some whites were peculiar and took their own gooddoing time about telling you what to do others like mama once said just thought you ought to know what they wanted done should she start with the dishes and where were the children she listened hard thinking maybe they were asleep or outside playing but there were no visible sounds except for a birds lonely chirpno sounds at all you know carrie mae youre twice as goodlooking as theyre saying in town he commented eyes travelling slowly over her face and down to pause at the sprouting breasts like pointed cones the way he said it mouth barely moving tongue moistening his lips made an alien hotness aside from the rooms heat envelop her she stared childishly wideeyed questioning straining for any sound beside the birds mocking chirp finishing the beer he tossed the bottle in the filled can near the sink seeing her unconsciously follow the movement he smiled thinly want one astonished she shook her head she had never tasted beer before but maybe she should have said yes since he was white maybe he was going to get mad because she didnt or could be testing her to see if she was dependable a hundred shuttering maybes tore through her just one aint gonna hurt he laughed leaning back against the sink its nice n cold n gives you a real nice feeling ah dont drink beer mista will his face took on a pretended surprise you mean you aint never sat in that niggrah beer garden in town on satday night numbly her head moved slowly from side to side of course she had never sat in that beer garden why mama would die she could see mama now on saturdays when they went into town to shop how mama pinched lipped would drag her quickly by the place noisily thumping out music and loose laughter while beer and whiskey smells floated out and tainted the air aw comon now carrie mae he said voice lowering intimately now ah just know pretty you are you sneak there with boys sometimes dont you no suh she denied shaking her head never well where do you go with the boys the questions bewildered her she couldnt understand them or why this white man would even bother to ask her such things she saw his eyes were strangely aflame blazing with a queer brittle light reminding her of a mirror throwing out a sun glaze ah dont go nowheres with no boys mista will mama say ahm too young to keep compny water was running down her face freely now she wished he would stop asking all those things and tell her what to do and she wished he would let some air in the closeness seemed to be affecting him too for sweat was lacing his face and chest he didnt seem to mind it though standing there arms folded lounging back on the sink watching her yeah he murmured tightly you suren hell pretty as they say she didnt know whether to feel good about what he was saying or not and were those they the white men who loafed by the pool hall smirking and saying nasty things to the colored girls going by she was puzzled and didnt say anything comere she stiffened a constriction gathering in her chest comere ah said he straightened up tensing himself on the balls of his feet a knot worked in his jaws when his eyes moved to her breast again dont be scared ah aint going to hurt you she walked stiffly toward him her eyes fearful closer she could smell the beer she stopped warily not too close not too far away enough to show the white man she had obeyed suddenly his arms reached out and snatched her against him her nose was pushed into the brush thicket of his chest as his arms imprisoned her relax now he said arms entombing her body like ah said ah aint gonna hurt you just thought we twod have a little fun mista will she began eyes enlarged in terror ahm sppose to keep your chillen suh you said you wanted me to keep your chillen he was breathing harshly now like in the car and his face had a funny queer look like he hadnt heard or couldnt an electric quiver trembled his body as his hand encircled her breast jesusss christ he mumbled pressing his body hard against her squeezing the jutting softness comon carrie mae loosen up ah know you done this before out in the bushes colored girl your age always has we both kin feel real fine together aint nobody gonna know nobody here but us nobody here he laughed easily thinking her surprise relief hell naw wife done took the kids with her yesditty ah got lonely out here in these woods by myself got to laying wake last night remembering how pretty the boys said you were damned if they didnt describe you to a t a frightened knowingness washed away all the silent questions besieging her panic flooded her rising through and up to her throat exposing itself in one raw cry no she beat against him attempting to break away what this white man wanted wasnt right even if he was white it wasnt right please suh let me go help shut up damnit cant nobody hear you no way shut up ah said his hand slapped her hard causing her head and senses to spin for a moment she leaned weakly against him fighting the foaming black dizziness then his hand felt downward between her legs shock ripped through her she lashed out bringing her knee up in a swift blow he grunted halfbending dropping his arms to grab himself when he did she broke away scrambling to the back door the door was locked panicstricken she turned quickly measuring the distance between him and the passage to the front door in a flash she streaked wildly by him knocking over the high chair pain stabbed her knees his arm shot out catching the back of her dress she gave a muffled animal cry as she broke from his grasp dress tearing in his hand she reached the front door frantically jerking it open comon back here ah said comon back she ran and ran and ran until the words were not even an echo mama was sitting on the front porch when she reached the cabin breathlessly she stumbled up the steps falling at mamas feet and dropping her head in mamas lap chilechilewhats the matter she felt the large warm arms enfolding her and it seemed a long time until she could get her breath before she could tell when she finished mama kept saying nochillennochillen in a singsong kind of way suddenly like the devil had been let loose mama jumped up exclaiming loudly we going to the pollice billy ray ran from around the house looking questioningly at them pollice what for you going to the pollice mind your bizness billy ray mama retorted shoving him aside the boy slyly lowered his lashes at carrie mae did you git my candy carrie mae shut up boy mama said thats all you think about your stomick her eyes fell upon the girl again looking at her face bruised and swollen and at her feet blistered and powdered with dust angry pain flashed in her face lets go chile she said low put this safety pin back of your dress we going just like this and show the pollice what that man tried to do billy ray you stay here til sara gits home ah wanna go ah wanna go the boy screeched jumping up and down now you keep quiet ah said stay here whimpering the boy edged sulkily into the house the law ought to take care of him for sure mama mumbled why he want to be messin round with young girls mamas voice grew indistinct and carrie mae couldnt hear the rest as they started toward the road a man in a pickup truck gave them a ride to town they tried to ignore his curious glances and outspoken what happened when mama asked to be let out at the courthouse wearily they began to climb the twenty narrow concrete steps to the big stone building housing the courthouse sheriffs office and jail there was a landing between the tenth and eleventh stepsa wide concrete platform supporting a statue of a confederate soldier a cool drinking fountain was in front of the soldier with a white only sign crudely printed attached to it they paused breathing heavily from the climb and heat beside the white only fountain mamas huge bosom rose and fell like a heaving wave then after a while she took hold of the girl and they began once again the climb the sheriff was moonfaced and needed a shave his obese form was sprawled carelessly behind a desk cluttered with papers pencils empty coke bottles and filled ash trays a large poster was framed behind him showing an american flag waving in a blue background with big black letters printed on it reading liberty and justice for all the sheriff scared carrie mae the way his flabby jaws worked in monotonous rhythm as he chewed tobacco and the way his small eyes glared stonily unblinking at them but he didnt seem to scare mama when he growled yeah whatdoyouwant mama spoke right up so distressed that the words tumbled out ahead of each other all right all right auntie take your time he interrupted fumbling through papers now he squinted at an official looking form whats your name lillie henry suh where you live lillie just outside town on mista tom wrights land suh whats her name he asked glancing briefly at carrie mae carrie mae suh hummm the pen stopped its scratching sound leaving a brief silence between them now lillie he began again frowning you say a man tried to assault this girl suh mama asked puzzled by the way he chewed his words with the tobacco ah said you say a man tried to git at this girl he snapped impatiently mama looked at carrie mae who stood motionless with her head down thats right mista sheriff she replied leaning over the desk in her anxiety he said he wanted her to mind his chillen while his wifes away but his wife and chillen were gone werent nobody there but him all the time sure damn looks like somebody tried to do something he snorted laughing this nigger live in town mama stared gravely watching him playing with the pen this wasnt no cullurd man mista sheriff this was a white man the sheriffs jaws abruptly stopped their grinding leaving the small pink lips slightly ajar for the first time he looked directly at her you mean to stand there and tell me a whiite man tried to rape her mama nodded shaking her head emphatically thats right suh mista bust will he came but before she could finish the sheriffs voice rose harshly waitaminute he was standing now face fiery red his bulbous stomach breathing like a separate entity hanging over his belt aint no nigger coming in mah office with any old accusashon like that aint a whiite man in this town whod even bother with any old nigger gal moving uncannily fast for his size he bridged the space around his desk with lightning speed trying to blame a niggers dirt on a whiite man now git outta mah office before ah put both your black asses in mah jail mama stood stark still mouth jarred loosely like she didnt understand or didnt want to understand what he was saying nigger he said dangerously even you hear what ah said clutching the girls hand mama moved out of the office feeling his eyes blazing through their backs hotter than the sun had been without a word they went dully down the twenty narrow concrete steps not pausing this time beside the confederate soldier and the white only fountain mamas hand squeezed painfully around hers like she was afraid the girl would disappear or like she needed something to hold on to bad they walked slowly through the town and on out to where the highway began oblivious to the town with its scattered knots of people and the ancient unmovable town scenes they were halfway down the road when the girl made a strangling sound and began to cry mama stopped and watched her face heavy and still the girls thin body shuddered as the sobs racked her body then after a long while ever so gently mama took her big apron and wiped the girls face hush chile hush she murmured softly aint no use in crying now aint no use the girl kept her face hidden in the aprons curtain smelling the aprons freshness and needing the aprons shelter finally the sobs subsided under the whispering kindness of the voice and the smooth familiar caress of the womans hand silent moments later mama pushed her gently away the girl watched her stare for a timeless eternity at the fading sky seeing mamas lips move ever so slightly like they did when she prayed in church on sunday then mamas hand reached for hers again and together they started slowly down the road home youre leaving f txt yes she said youre leaving me no n no leavins you

window he stood watching snow flakes flutter in the cold breeze he stood watching the snow flakes flutter and cover the blank stone spaces of the rooftops below and after awhile he returned to bed ill tell you how much more he began and fell silent she was snoring softly he covered her gently not wishing to wake her we are all let us face it mississippians we all fervently wish that the negro problem did not exist or that if it must exist it could be ignored confronted with the howling need for decent schools jobs housing and all the other minimum rights of the american system we will do our best in a halfhearted way to correct old wrongs the hand may be extended grudgingly and patronizingly but anyone who rejects that hand rejects his own best interests for minimum rights are the only rights that we are willing to guarantee and above those minimum rights there is and will continue to be a vast area of discrimination and inequity and unfairness the area in which we claim the most basic right of allthe right to be stupid and prejudiced the right to make mistakes the right to be less and worse than we pretend the right to be ourselves when this majority right is threatened the majority will react accordinglywith results that could be disastrous to all of us from the editorial a new white backlash in the september saturday evening post black_power has claimed its first two victims they are vice president hubert humphrey and roy wilkins executive secretary of the naacp both men honored veterans of the civil_rights movement succumbed temporarily at least to the most ancient of maladies the inability to adjust to a new idea we find nothing subversive in sncc chairman stokely carmichaels remarks on the contrary this type of thinking is both practical and traditionally american nor should the older generation of civil_rights leaders object to the young negroes wanting to run their own show with white men supporting rather than dominating the various organizations this should be interpreted as a sign of maturity it means that negroes having won their le gal rights under the old system now are ready to work toward their goals under their own leadership like any other minority this too is traditional american history does not show that the irish were content to be led by yankees or that working men were content to be led by their employers in short we are suggesting that the older generation of civil_rights leaders avoid the mistakes of hubert humphrey and roy wilkins and resist the urge to panic at the sound of black_power we suggest that the older civil_rights generation reexamine this new concept of direct action and concentrate on the more thoughtful speeches of black_power advocates these young men are surprisingly realistic and are fully aware of both their caabilities and their limitations and ike it or not they are destined to be the doers of the new era of civil_rights whether they do good or evil depends in part on whether their predecessors encourage or repress themfrom the boston herald july the countrys newspaper proprietors the vast majority enjoying a monopoly preside over an institution that should be the most sensitive detector of change in society but among major american institutions newspapers have been the least responsive to upheavals in civilization since world war ii government education religion and much of corporate life have adapted to altered conditions in economic and social life but newspaper owners have clung to the past they seem to be reminded of their special status under the first amendment only when someone suggests changes in the secondclass mailing privilege or the payment of standard wages to delivery boys their response to the nation of the press being accountable to the public is to bar reporters from sessions of the american newspaper publishers association in addition the dangers of news monopoly are increasing from houstons shackled press by ben h bagdikian in the august atlantic behind the nondebate is a very real crisis in the movement which is more precisely a crisis in american life the dream of an integrated national community is about over all the dreamstuffthe assumptions about a mobile pluralistic egalitarian societyseems to be vanishing the country has responded to negro demands over the past decade primarily by eliminating the symbols of southern feudalism legal segregation disenfranchisement official brutality otherwise there have been few changes in american institutions the economy still excludes the underclass of poor negroes from productive employment the naacp is the traditional home of the small negro middleclass its president is white and jewish its director roy wilkins is the grin on the democratic administrations civil_rights face he heads the official civil_rights lobby the leadership conference in washington vice president humphrey to nobodys surprise was the principal speaker at the naacp convention recently in los angeles and not surprisingly the naacp condemned black_power and reiterated its support for an integration strategy and why not the net result of the bloody demonstrations of poor negroes in the south has been benefits for middleclass negroes in the northandrew kopkind in new statesman july an eightyear old negro a girl flipped the pages of her new third y grade social studies book as she came to the last page she seemed puzzled she reread the books cover and began a more deliberate inspection of its contents after scanning the book a second time the littli girl raised her hand and asked her teacher where am in this book undoubtedly a similar question has run across the minds of millions of nearo vounasters from whence have i come in americas history and who am i and where do i fit in american society this is not a new feeling seventysix years ago edward a johnson noted nearo historian and educator wrote of how the little colored child feels when he has completed the assigned course of united states history and in it found not one word of credit not one word of favorable comment tor even one among the millions of his foreparents who have lived through nearly three centuries of his countrys history the unfortunate and tragic fact is that generations of negro children have grown up with a warped attitude toward themselves their parents and grandparents inside the american classroom they have not found anything to give them a sense of dignity and selfworth they have searched vainly through pure white books for some positive recognition of their races contribution to the civilization of man outside the classroom these negro youngsters and their parents have been subjected to the severe hardships the unending frustrations and humiliations of discrimination and segregation they have become a people robbed of their rich history and culture by historians through omissions neglect and the perputation of racial stereotypes and myths this has been a great american tragedy we have no way of knowing how many negro youths have become frustrated discouraged and bitter over their feeling of nobodyness we have no way of knowing how many potential negro scientists scholars doctors teachers and businessmen have been swept into the ditch of oblivion by the psychological backlash from the negro history gap dr charles h wesley educator author and historian who cur rently serves as executive director of the association for the study of negro life and history has written history is not the story of men and women of one race or color and the neglect and omission of the men and women of another race and color it is neither the glorification of white people nor black people but it is the story of people irrespective of race or color it should deal with people in all times and places and should present the contribution of all the people to civilization when a part of the people has been neglected or given subordinate places history in order to be truthful must be reconstructed i agree with dr wesley let us reconstruct american history as it really happened let the full facts be known the real story told of the remarkable contributions of negroes to americas growth and greatness let all our children negro and white learn the complete history of our country let them learn that negroes were here as far back as the days when columbus discovered the western hemisphere that negroes accompanied the spanish and portuguese explorers of the new world negroes were among the settlers who founded los angeles explorer jean baptiste point du sable a frencheducated negro trader founded our countrys second citychicago in surveyor benjamin banneker helped major pierre p enfant plan and lay out the city of washington inventor elijah mccoy devised the selflubricating machine matthew henson was the first man to set foot on the north pole minutes ahead of his chief admiral perry let our boys and girls learn about slavepoetess phillis wheatley who began the tradition of negro literature in america about frederick douglass a great american orator and statesman who played a significant role in the outcome of the civil war let the education of both youths and adults include proper recognition of the nameless black masses whose toil helped build american cities let all of us understand and appreciate the true role of the negro in this countrys struggle for freedom and justice let every american know that the very first man to lose his life in the cause of american independence was crispus attucks shot down by the british in the boston massacre of five thousand negroes fought in the forces of general george washington in our war for independence gave their lives to the north from among in the union armies and navy negro troops charged up san juan hill with teddy roosevelts rough riders they fought and died for their country in world wars i and ii throughout the truth of negro history runs a nobility in the face of adversity an epic faith over pain and travail a courage which exalts character the negros past is americas past as is his present and future he is an integral part of the warp and woof of the varied american fabric america has made a start in closing its history gao but much work remains to be done in recent years boards of edu m cation have written and published their own supplementary texts on negro history some textbook publishers have revised and updated their materials on the negro in american history professional organizations in recent months have sponsored national conferences on the treatment of minorities in textbooks this is a good beginning all segments of our society must work together in bridging our history gap for the shared pride in negro history and achievement is a solid foundation upon which to build a new and healthy climate of mutual respect and understanding among all elements of society in the words of frederick douglass this is a time when the american people are once more being urged to do from necessity what they should have done from a sense of right and of sound w statesmanship arter g woodc son was always so full of new ideas that he had no need to repeat himself yet on many occasionsespecially at the saturday sessions of the annual meeting of the association for the study of negro life and history when school teachers were present he would make a statement that went something like this it will be a great day for the association and for the study of american history when it will no longer be necessary to direct special attention to the fact that the negro has always been a part of american history he would then go on to say that the purpose of negro history week was to promote the history negro to the history week longer be necessary year in and year out dr woodson worked diligently to promote a new american history that would reject the notion that the negro had no history or that he should be treated in some special way no one was a more vigorous protagonist of the idea that the history of the united states should be completely integrated no one did more to point out the fallacies and inaccuracies of works in history assumed that the negro had no place in such works no single person did more to promote a new american historya democratic equalitarian american historyas far as racial and ethnic groups are concerned happily dr woodson lived long enough to witness the feeble beginnings of a new american history that accepted his ideas and premises but his wildest dreamsand he did dreamcould not have visualized what would happen in this area in the years following his death today heightened interest on the part of americans in discovering a new and more accurate place for the negro in american life and history is the result of the operation of a number of factors and forces it was interestingly enough stimulated by the legal fight for equality that began in earnest during the postwar years in the united states supreme court drew attention to the question of the history of the negro in american life by inquiring into the intent of the framers of the fourteenth amendment did they intend that the amendment should prevent segregated schools and other forms of segregation immediately lawyers and their consultants in the field of history scurried to the libraries and archives and began to pen lengthy and learned treatises on the activities of negroes during the reconstruction the programs and motives of their protagonists and the abortions performed on the fourteenth amendment by its wouldbe subverted it was a part of the general search for a broader and deeper meaning of the american experience brought on in part by the wartime effort to articulate a democratic ideology and in part by the postwar search for moral stability the search sent historians in a dozen different directions and they wrote on such diverse subjects as the american political tradition the image of man in america and faith of our fathers one historian emphasizing the transitory nature of some of our institutions and the recency of some others argued successfully that the legal institution of segregation was not nearly as old as the myth would have us believe perhaps most of all the search for a new american history was a direct consequence of the generationlong persistence of woodson his associates and the slowly increasing number of adherents to the view that american history as it had been taught and written in the past was tragically and deplorably incomplete thus it was not unlike the history of the civil_rights movement of a later date those who came to embrace the civil_rights movement did not invent it although some thought they did they merely discovered it those who began to think about american history and write about it in a new dimension did not invent it although some thought they did they merely discovered it as they searched among the heap of revisionist historical writings and suggestions for new approaches that had been ignored and disregarded for many years by the main body of american historians it was a most rewarding discovery made even more rewarding by a new willingness to discover new truths even if it called for a revision of longheld highly regarded views it made possible a new appraisal of ancient african cultures for which dr woodson had called in his african background outlined it facilitated a new look at the conditions among negroes before the civil war which dr woodson had helped to illuminate in his education of the negro prior to a score of other areas came to the attention of those who sought to fill the gaps in the history of american life the role of negroes during the civil war the complex relationships of freedom to the social order during reconstruction the intellectual response of negroes to postreconstruction degradation and the economic and political meaning of the color line in the twentieth century the veritable spate of books and articles that have come from the writers of the new american history in the past years has inevitably resulted in the massing of a great body of new facts and the projection of many new interpretations but the discovery has only just begun anyone familiar with the old american history knows all too well that we must yet fill innumerable gaps about such matters as the colonial negro the negro artisan the negro abolitionist the negro in the early days of organized labor and even the negro in congress but it is equally clear that the logjam created by silence or distortion has been broken and that in time more gaps will be filled they will be filled by those who present the results of their diligent research at the annual meetings of the association for the study of negro life and history the southern historical association the american historical association the organization of american historians and numerous other historical societies it seems almost unnecessary to remark that all historical activities today do not necessarily contribute to the new american history some historians whose writings reflect both diligence and zeal resist new interpretations with a vigor that is similar to the vigor of those in other areas who seek to keep inviolate the old order others more subtle and if i may say so more sinister work assiduously to discover new materials only to use them to reflect unfavorably on the very idea of a new american history still others opportunists pure and simple and frequently merely pseudohistorians at best seize the opportunity presented by a more congenial climate to write or more properly to slap together somethinganythingon the negro these opportunists see the ready market and they would not miss it for the world their interest is not new american history but new american dollars one can only say that the reader nay the buyer beware neither the antagonists nor the opportunists can stem the tide that has set in although they can perhaps delay it or subvert it we move nevertheless inexorably toward a condition in our study of american history where it is possible to reexamine the total american past and on the basis of that reexamination we can write a new synthesis of the american experience this is not to imply that such a work should have an air of finality about it indeed it would be better if it emphasized the tentative nature of its findings and interpretations for example we already know a great deal about reconstruction we know that the night was not as long or as dark as we have been told and we can prove it but we yet have much to learn about what actually happened during the socalled night of reconstruction and we have much to learn about who kept it from being so dark or so long and how they did it in other words the very spirit of the new american history is one of revisionism and one of the most important things that the revisionist spirit does is to recognize the possibility of further modification as well as greater precision and refinement even when the materials are readily available the writing of a new american history is no easy task first of all it calls on the writer to make certain assumptions that are in keeping with the underlying forces in american history among them is the assumption that american history is not the success story of white anglosaxon protestants who as the story goes made this country strong and great against all odds rather the history of the united states is the story of a joint enterprise with various groups and individuals playing certain roles either taken by them or assigned to them the roles they have played however exalted or however humble have been important in the making of america secondly it rejects the notion that the history of the united states is merely an exercise to inspire blind loyalty and patriotism this is not to say that the new american history should set out to undermine devotion to country that would be a tragic mistake it is to say however that a healthy devotion to country must rest on a clear understanding of what actually happened and not on some fantasy of what should have happened any american history worth writing or worth studying recognizes the fact that this land was peopled from the beginning with ordinary human beingsvery fallible human beings they made mistakes many mistakes and they were wrongheaded in many ways it is unfortunate that the colonists did not want negroes in the continental army but the fact is that they did not it is a sad commentary on the use of the natural rights philosophy that the continental congress would not permit the condemnation of slavery in the declaration of independence but the fact is that it would not it is tragic that for more than years the united states would not recognize haiti because it was a black nation but that is an undeniable fact it is not pleasant to discover that the entire american experience is suffused with certain doctrines of racism that have at times been decisive in determining the course of american history but who can deny this after studying the history of the ideology of white supremacy in the united states that has justified slavery segregation discrimination and degradation the lesson that the new american history teaches is that only by a critical realistic appraisal of the past can we understand the roots of the difficulties that plague the nation today otherwise we will be like the master who in describing his runaway slave as one with whelps and gashes on his back then commented sardonically that he could not possibly understand why the slave ran away it should be added that the new american history requires a sense of balance and proportion that may be easily upset by the zeal that comes from the effort to redress the balance in reassessing the negros role in american history to give an absurd example one must not insist that crispus attucks was the central figure in the war of independence he died five years before it began in restating the negros valiant resistance to slavery one must not insist that every slaveowner had his brutus or his nat turner it is well to remember that most slaveowners had one or two slaves and they were in no position to mount a large scale conspiracy it is indeed remarkable if a given generation of oppressed restrained degraded people cc produce one nat turner it derstandable that some inose who have suffered from centuries of almost complete omission from the nations history should now insist on converting the history of the united states largely into a history of the negro people but the new american history cannot answer the call either for preferential treatment as is advocated in the argument for greater job opportunities for negroes or for proportional representation as if history could be allocated to people in the way that congressional districts are arranged happily there are now some historians who on the basis of preparation understanding and temperament are prepared to write the new american history but we can derive no great satisfaction from that fact for the numbers are not large and we still desperately need more such historians we need more of those who will search out the still undisclosed facts that will illuminate every page of the history of this country and we need historians who will provide new works for every level of understanding it is not enough that the new american history should be revealed in the pages of the learned journals or even in the college textbooks many of which are still merely warmedover versions of the old history the new american history must become a part of the curriculum of our schools the need for a new history in the elementary grades and in the eighth and eleventh grades is at least as great as the need for a new mathematics or a new biology i hasten to add that the new american history requires still other qualities of the historian namely commitment determination and courage while the parents and others may accept the new math merely because they are mesmerized by its mysteries many of them will not take the new history without a fight they confidently feel that they know the history of their country and the uses to which history should be put unaccustomed as they are to revisionism or indeed to any innovations they will resist change with a fierceness that will frighten the fainthearted and with a zeal that will defeat the uncommitted for example one must not be surprised if management is outraged by any suggestion that selfishness has been a motivating force in the conduct of american business or if labors feelings are hurt by a description of racial discrimination in the unions one must be prepared to hear patriotic mothers expressing distress if the new history has no picture of betsy ross making the first american flag and isolationists decrying any reference to the united nations and one must realize that ethnic and minority groups will have axes to grind such as negroes weeping if the recently discovered negro cowboys do not receive equal treatment in the story of the winning of the west the forces resisting the new american history have great influence and are in many instances wellorganized a member of a school board in a great american city has declared that as long as one of the new history books has a certain statement in it she will mock its use in the schools of that city the statement is a quotation from president lincolns speech to the negroes of richmond in which one of his listeners reported him as having said let me say god has made you free although you have been deprived of your godgiven rights by your socalled masters you are now as free as i am and if those that claim to be your superiors do not know that you are free take the sword and bayonet and teach them that you are free for god created all men free giving to each the same rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness one wonders what the board members reaction would have been if instead of using the richmond quotation the historian had used the peoria quotation in which lincoln said that he did not believe in the social and political equality of whites and negroes the ingenuity as well as the resources of the opponents of the new american history may be regarded as virtually limitless in one state where a new history book has been under consideration it has been condemned as one that is designed to give a white child a sense of guilt because it has an entire chapter on slavery and because there is a drawing of a negro child in looking rather wistfully at a group of white children playing on a school ground opponents have demanded that the drawing be omitted or that it be redrawn to include the negro child at play with the white children it is indeed easier to redraw the picture than to integrate the schools of south carolina in or in the book has been condemned as polemical because it presents a chart showing that school desegregation has progressed at a snails pace it is true that a new day has dawned for the new american history it enjoys a congenial climate and it flourishes in some places but if one seeks merely to promote the study of historyany history in the united states the line of least resistance still is to write the old history that offends no one except history itself and those who have no place in it but we cannot take that line any more than we can desert the larger struggle for equality for the new american history is in a real sense a part of the struggle to achieve dignity and equality in american life if any among us ever fancied ourselves as resting safely in the ivory tower of learning alienated from life itself then we should retreat to the security of the old history but if we regard ourselves as fighters for freedom and equality we need not go far to find the battleground the opponentsthe defenders of the old order and the old historylie in wait and the battleground is at the very place where we take up our pens and do battle for a new truthseeking democratic american history in our a number of mean something country we celebrate nationwide holidays like george washingtons birthday but we also have historic days which primarily to a particular group or which are celebrated in only one state or region it is not surprising that the negro a longtime american would have his quota of special days to remember it is to be noted too that these negro history holidays were dates on which something had taken place not locally but on the national or international scene the first of these historic days is a case in pointmarch this was the boston massacre in which the british soldiers shot and killed five civilians one of these was crispus attucks a mulatto the first to die the boston massacre would not be forgottenthe colonial patriots would see to that its anniversary was duly observed each year in a public ceremony bells would toll during the day and in the evening a leading citizen would deliver a stirring address against british tyranny the boston massacre marked the dawn of the american revolution but in with the coming of the fourth of july it fell into disuse as a holiday it was resurrected by boston negroes in as a protest against the dred scott decision appropriately enough the meeting place of the commemorative exercises was faneuil hall from which attucks had been buried and the speaker was the abolitionist orator wendell phillips thirty years later in the dream of the boston negroes was realized when the state legislature and the city council appropriated for the erection of a crispus attucks monument to be placed on the boston common in the occurrence which we commemorate the colored race has a profound interest for one of that race was the principal figure in it said william h dupree negro chairman of the citizens committee as he opened the exercises boston negroes of a later generation would succeed in having governors of the state officially proclaim march as crispus attucks day another date dear to negroes of a bygone century was august west india emancipation day when in an act of parliament abolishing slavery in englands island possessions went into effect negroes and their abolitionist supporters were not enthusiastic about our own fourth of july believing it a mockery to celebrate american independence and freedom as long as slavery existed in our country they found a satisfying substitute in august it was a date of vast significance to us wrote peter h clark of cincinnati it was the morning star heralding the rise of the sun of our liberty in many instances negroes celebrated august in company with whites for racial intermingling in a friendly and relaxed setting no affair could touch an august picnic in some instances negroes held celebrations all their own this was particularly true after the civil war whites ceasing to mark the day once american slavery had ended negroes however continued to welcome all who might wish to come to the celebration in topeka kansas in they extended an earnest invitation to all freedom loving white persons to turn out with us on that occasion the august anniversaries naturally struck a serious note with a sermon and an address often climaxed by an original poem by someone like frances e w harper or j m whitfield but coming in midsummer an august celebration was sometimes held in a shady grove thus becoming something of a picnic in fact if not in name the proceedings might be enlivened by games of dexterity and stunts and perhaps a band concert a military drill a fireworks display or even a balloon ascension in the cities the day might be ended by a formal dance or by a concert by someone like elizabeth greenfield the black swan in san francisco in the sponsors of the celebration advised potential customers not to worry about how to get home assuring them that the horse cars will run all night with the coming of the twentieth century the august celebrations tended to become fewer being observed mainly by negroes who had come from the west indies the civil war years brought two of the negros historic holidays both of them slaveemancipating occasions the first of these was april when the slaves in the district of columbia were set free by an act of congress lifting their voices in joy and thanksgiving negroes from coast to coast held a series of celebration meetings if we rejoice and give thanks to the almighty wrote the editor of the angloafrican we rejoice less as black men than as part and parcel of the american people for it is clearly a great boon to the nation at large than to the class more immediately concerned however the subsequent observance of april was almost exclusively left in the hands of the negro understandably too it gradually became a district of columbia affair primarily generally the april celebrations took the form of a street parade followed by a formal speech indoors led by a squad of mounted police the parade was usually directed by christian a fleetwood a congressional medal winner for heroism in the civil war companies of the national guard benevolent societies and fraternal organizations made up the line of march generally the procession halted before the home of senator charles sumner while the band played auld lang syne then the paraders went to a hall or a church for a twohour address by the speaker of the day often this would be the peerless frederick douglass a resident of the district with his death in the celebration lost something it never regained the second of the slaveemancipating occasions celebrated by negroes was the day of jubilee itselfjanuary the day when president lincoln declared free the slaves in the rebellious states negroes could scarcely contain themselves over the good news throughout the country there were proclamation meetings all of them the scenes of joyous excitement the most glorious day this nation has ever seen wrote the young schoolteacher charlotte forten in her diary certainly it was the greatest day in the history of the negro american its annual observance became an honored tradition the historian frenise a logan describes a typical emancipation day celebration in the towns throughout north carolina replete with brass band a negro militia company a negro fire company and several social organizations negroes would march through the principal streets to the courthouse here the procession would gather to hear the reading of the emancipation proclamation followed by an address from a prominent negro or a sympathetic white man but for all its importance emancipation day came at a season when the weather was likely to be cold and blustery hence some negroes preferred september as slaveemancipation day it was on this date in that lincoln issued his preliminary proclamation declaring that if the rebel states did not lay down their arms by january he would declare their slaves free but as a historic holiday september despite its more favorable position on the calendar never really rivalled january after the latter itself lost some of its popular appeal tending to become an indoors affair even in the warmer climates with the negro churches as its chief sponsor out of the freeing of the slaves came some of the negro holidays restricted to one state on july nev york negroes inaugurated the annual observance of the abolition of slavery in their state in the negroes in texas launched the yearly celebration of june juneteenththe day on which slavery there came to its end during the hopeful years after the civil war the negro people warmed up the fourth of july now that slavery was gone they felt that they could celebrate independence day without mixed emotions certainly if anyone had a right to celebrate the fourth it was the negro the return of the festival of our national independence wrote john greenleaf whittier in has called our attention to a matter which has been carefully kept out of sight by orators and toastdrinkers we allude to the participation of colored men in the great struggle for american freedom negroes had always wished to unite with other americans in observing the glorious fourth indeed as if in anticipation the young men of the banneker institute in philadelphia held an independence day celebration at franklin hall in a brass and string band played several national airs opening with hail columbia the orator of the day william h johnson asserted that the declaration of independence included black men as well as white men and that it encourages us to live and labor zealously for our rights here in america johnsons words seemed to come true in when the fifteenth amendment was ratified sometimes referred to as the keystone of reconstruction this measure sought to protect the negro at the polls the day of ratification was march and it marked another day to be encircled in the negros calendar in some cities negro women wore shawls of red white and blue at a ratification celebration held in baltimore more than negroes marched through the streets we have a future everything is possible to us said one of the speakers ratification day did indeed seem to have a future some negroes preferred it to emancipation day on the grounds that lincolns proclamation benefited the slave whereas the fifteenth amendment benefited all negroes and it was true that the amendment was ad vantageous to the negro whether north or south its sponsors definitely having in mind the negro vote in the north but the march observances petered out within a decade baltimore holding one of the last of them in by then the southern negro was fast losing the ballot and the bright promises of reconstruction were fading hence it is not surprising that a civil_rights act passed in gave rise to no new negro holiday it was just as well eight years later in the supreme court ruled that the act was illegal the day this decision was handed down was a gloomy one for negroes a day not unlike that on which john brown was hanged or lincoln was shot in the twentieth century perhaps the nearest thing to a nationwide negro history holiday would be may when the supreme court ruled that public school segregation was contrary to the constitution but since world war ii there have been many breakthroughs and firsts on the race relations front with so many things happening no single date could take on standout proportions in taking a final glance at the negro redletter days it is to be noted that all of them celebrate some aspect of freedom this is their significance and their essential americanism for what is it that makes the united states a nation not a common ancestry and not a history stretching back into legendary times our nationhood is based upon our commitment to the ideas of liberty and equality these are the twin goals which negro americans have expounded and for which so many have put their lives on the line and the holidays which they have held in highest esteem were those which marked a milestone in their countrys journey along freedom road contrary to the beliefs of all too many scholars relatively large numbers of negro americans have for centuries identified with africa this identification has been reflected in backtoafrica movements missionary efforts historicalcultural references and what i here refer to as the rhetoric of african recognitionthat is the accept ance and affirmation of ones african origins the major focus of this paper is on w e b du bois and to a lesser extent carter woodson two of this centurys leading advocates of african consciousness among negro americans these men however were not alone in their concern with african history and culture othersmartin delaney and alexander crummell during the th century bruce and schomburg during the th to name a fewspent much of their lives in search of the african past though the latter two were not as well equipped by training to unravel what was at best a conundrum for most americans in the early part of the century their views are nevertheless mentioned for both men played significant roles in promoting the study of african history and culture it is beyond the scope of this paper to attempt an exposition and interpretation of the full corpus of thought on africa entertained by du bois and woodson my purpose is to present the most salient views of du bois and woodson on africa and test them at certain critical points against the findings of modern scholarship in the process i hope to determine the extent to which these men provided a better understanding of the history of africa moreover i shall present the views of du bois and woodson against that backdrop of african consciousness among many negroes which persisted despite efforts at repression over the centuries with respect to du bois writings on the psyches of persons of african descent i want to suggest through the introduction of fairly representative examples of his thinking on the subject an analogy between his views and the negritude schools of thought finally i have not entered into a discussion of either the garvey movement or the new negro movement but certainly a more complete treatment of the conflict between garvey and du bois over the african question is much needed and long overdue and an examination of the artistic views held by du bois visavis poets like langston hughes claude mckay and countee cullen would certainly throw into sharper relief the particular variant of negritude espoused by du bois however terrible the shocks through which slaves went before and after their arrival in americatraumas which p doubtless in time erased practically all memories of the an cestral home from the minds of these black mensome articulate ones among the race throughout the centuries identified with africa in making this identification they probably spoke for a large segment of the inarticulate masses benjamin banneker writing at a time when mockery was made of the negros color and ancestral home wrote to thomas jefferson in that he freely and cheerfully acknowledged the fact that he was of the african race and in that color which is natural to them of the deepest dye forty years later david walker in his militant appeal urged the slaves to revolt exclaiming if any are anxious to ascertain who i am know the world that i am one of the oppressed degraded and wretched sons of africa rendered so by the avaricious and unmerciful among the whites between bannekers letter and walkers appeal an event took place which probably had much to do with the way many th century negroes were later to view africain the american colonization society was founded for the purpose of transporting all free negroes back to africa st clair drake has observed drake is probably correct in his theory that after the formation of the american colonization society many negroes tended to eschew use of the word african and opt for colored nevertheless the use of the word african was much in evidence throughout the th century having frequently been used by negro abolitionists and intellectualsnotably henry h garnett and alexander crummelland reconstruction leaders such as richard cain and bishop henry m turner indeed these men not only frequently referred to negroes as africans but made a more significant identification with africa by advocating at one time or another emigration to africa in this regard crummell and turner had lasting influence identification with africa at the turn of the century seemed to be as it had been during earlier periods closely related to how negroes were faring in america during the s increasingly large numbers of negroes became disenchanted with race relations and either looked to africa or to central america as a place of refugein much the same way that embattled jews have looked to israel in our time the harsh decades from to doubtless contributed to the efficacy of bishop turners back to africa movement and to the growth of african consciousness along historical lines by the close of the century unquestionably as the lines of race hardened in the opening years of the century august meier has written there was an increasing tendency to use negro history to foster race pride and group solidarity as the basis of advancement by collective action and as an antidote to prejudice and discrimination as an expression of this growing interest in the heritage of people of african descent there was a veritable proliferation of negro history groups prominent among such groups were the american negro historical society of philadelphia the negro society for historical research and the association for the study of negro life and history it should be recalled that the influence of social darwinism was not inconsiderable in america during the last quarter of the th century and the early decades of the th century the period during which negroes were becoming increasingly interested in their history glorifiers of the anglosaxon race sat in some of the most important seats of learning propounding the thesis that only the teutonic nations were able to maintain states in which freedom could flourish james k hosmer short history of anglosaxon freedom and john w burgess political science and comparative constitutional law celebrated the anglosaxon virtues and sought to establish the view that government of the people and by the people is of ancient anglosaxon origin rejecting the notion that africans and asians could govern themselves hosmer concluded that the inevitable issue is to be that ft the primacy of the world will lie with us english institutions english speech english thought are to become the main features of the political social and intellectual life of mankind people of color to be sure were unfit and not likely to survive but the traducers of people of african descent in the western world had long been active drake has written thus a formidable task lay ahead for those who would attempt to establish the negros humanity by reclaiming his heritage for the heritage of negroesslave as well as africanhad been systematically scored for centuries while it would be easier for negro scholars and writers to demonstrate negro achievement in americanell william wells brown and george washington williams had long since documented negro achievements from the colonial period to the civil war the job of discovering african achievement would for a number of reasons be much more formidable for one thing previous identification with africa among th century negroes had taken in the main missionary or emigrationist lines for another european expansion into africa during the th century had been attended by considerable antiafrican propaganda this expansion according to drake came at a period when the coincidence of certain factors made an extremely derogatory appraisal of africa almost inevitable among these factors were the tide of humanitarian sentiment the theory of the survival of the fittest the movement to set out to save africa for christ the attempt to partition africa and break native resistance and the rapid increase of literacy which laid the base for a penny press selling sensationalism the members of the various american negro historical associations were not unmindful of this propaganda they like other american negroes growing up in the early part of the twentieth century probably heard of africa in church when ministers appealed for financial aid to support missionary work in africa the president of the negro society for historical research john edward bruce in some ways anticipating cheikh anta diop declared that the history of whites prior to b c was a monumental fraud a total blank the white man stole his alphabet and derived his knowledge of science and religion from ancient african civilization which bore more than favorable comparison in many respects to modern europe the secretary of the society arthur a schomburg urged negroes to learn arabic because much of our life is undoubtedly wrapped up in the history customs and traditions of africa negro history should be taught in the public schools because it is the season for us to devote our time to kindling the torches that will inspire us to racial integrity the most impressive and scholarly work done by negroes to recover the african past and instill pride in negroes however was done by carter woodson and w e b du bois though both were better equipped by training than men like bruce and schomburg there was no question that they were out to prove through the application of science to history the essential humanity of people of african descent this desire led both men to attack negro stereotypes born of the slave experience as well as those more directly related to europan expansion into africa at the close of the th century as one of the first negro scholars thoroughly grounded in the scientific method of handling historical materials carter woodson was a leader in the effort to present a more faithful representation of the negros past it might be said that his concern over the harm being done to the american negros psyche by racist propaganda led him to explore the african roots of that past l d reddick writing in crisis has described the forces which led woodson to realize the need for a racial revision of the writing of the history of people of african descent woodson saw clearly what american culture was doing to the psyche of the negro racist elements were strong whether one looked at literature newspapers science or social science historically most of the nations scientists social as well as naturalhad gone along with the theory that the negro was a more animallike physical type and definitely inferior mentally actually the whole context of this consideration was subjective yet to the man in the street the words of an eminent biologist anthropologist or psychologist meant scientific proof it was this scientific proof that woodson set out to challenge in his most noted work the negro in our history he devotes four chapters to african history and one to african art writing in a time in which few american historians evinced an interest in african history woodson discusses among other things the geography of africa the myth of african inferiority and the misrepresentation of travelers public functionaries and missionaries in africa concerning the missionaries he reports that among a few there was some tendency toward fairmindedness and an attempt to rise unto an appreciation of the africans contribution to civilization many of them however use exaggerating language contradicting themselves in praising africans in one place and denouncing them in another the missionarys account of the african cannot in the main be relied on for it would be unwise to expect that the partisans of a particular religion seeking to uproot another can be depended upon to report definitely on the virtues of the people whom they would proselyte woodson observed that if the missionary had a good impression of the natives religion and morals he would necessarily be disqualified for missionary effort he argues that the books written by most of these missionaries therefore are largely worthless in arriving at an appreciation of african culture implicit in woodsons criticism of the accounts of travelers public functionaries and missionaries was his own deep appreciation of african civilization he believed that black africans had not only distinguished themselves in developing and maintaining empires of the stature of ghana mali and songhay but were in large measure responsible for the birth of egyptian civilization for carter woodson history seems to indicate that that country egypt was first settled by a negro tribe that mingled later with mediterranean people coming from the north egypt was the land of mixed breed or persons comparable to negroes passing in america onethird of the egyptians in his view were distinctly black woodson based much of his thinking on black african influence in egypt on the works of the distinguished anthropologist franz boas particularly boas the mind of primitive man and leo frobenius the voice of africa though railed at by many who thought he was making too much of black african achievements woodsons insistence that egypt was greatly influenced by black africa has since been corroborated by many distinguished africanists notably basil davidson and immanuel wallerstein to be sure few serious students of africa today deny this influence though there is some disagreement as to the extent of black african participation in the construction of egyptian civilization carter woodson devoted considerable attention to african empires in his writings this was especially true as regards his treatment of ghana more than any other american says rayford logan woodson made known the medieval kingdom of ghana so that it evoked real meaning when the gold coast became selfgoverning on march his the african background outlined according to melville j herskovits represented a serious attempt to comprehend the entire picture of the negro african and new world in its historical and functional setting woodsons discussion of african institutions does not for the most part vary significantly from what anthropologists such as herskovits have subsequently written concerning traditional african life and customs he clearly demonstrated that there was nothing simple and backward about the organization of african societies with respect to the training of children the conception of religion the morals of the people and the forms of political organization and woodson fully realized the need for american negroes to understand and appreciate these aspects of the african past for as herskovits has remarked concerning this matter no group in the population of this country has been more completely convinced of the inferior nature of the african background than have the negroes woodson speaking of general reactions among negroes framed the problem in in these terms just as woodson detected africanisms in american negro religious practices so did he view new world negro artistic expression as being under the strong influence of africa which was in his view the natural setting indeed woodson held to a view of the negro much like that held by later proponents of negritude it is generally agreed now he wrote that the negro has more of a spiritual makeup than other races he has not permitted his mind wholly to dominate his body he feels things deeply and he can express them emotionally the negros art could be explained by his temperament or his natural gifts no one else popularized interest in africa among american negroes as much as woodson he could number scholars and large segments of the negro people among his followers the interest in africa inspired by woodson was accomplished through the annual meetings of the association for the study of negro life and history which he headed through his negro history week celebrations which he began promoting in and through the pages of the journal of negro history in addition to the meetings of the association and negro history week as vehicles for imparting information on africa was the negro in our history a book which had gone through eight printings by the end of world war ii though undistinguished in style and organization this book as rayford w logan pointed out in conveyed to more persons white and black pertinent information about the negro than has any other single volume in the year carter woodson established the association for the study of negro life and history the home university library brought out w e b du bois slim little volume the negro if woodson had a greater impact on american negroes in the promotion of african history du bois influence on africans and the american academic community was destined to be far greater very early in his life while but a child on his greatgrandmothers knee he had had his first introduction to africa it is of no small significance that his introduction was cultural with africa i had only one direct cultural connection and that was the african melody which my greatgrandmother used to sing where she learned it i do not know perhaps she herself was born in africa or had it of a mother or father stolen and transported but at any rate coming to the valleys of the hudson and housatonic black little and lithe she shivered and shrank in the harsh north winds looked longingly at the hills and often crooned a heathen melody to the child between her knees thus do bana coba gene me gene me do bana coba gene me gene me ben dnuli nuli null ben dle if the significance of this strange music did not surface upon the consciousness of du bois until later his african racial feeling came exclusively from his later learning and reaction his recoil from the assumptions of the whites and his experience in the south and at fisk he felt himself african by race an integral member of the group of dark americans who were called negroes by the time he entered harvard in du bois largely due to his experiences at fisk university had already developed an interest in negro american culture much superior to that of most negro students so close were africans and negroes linked together in his mind that he chose for his harvard commencement address the topic jefferson davis and the african which was later changed to jefferson davis as a representative of civilization in his masters thesisthe suppression of the slave tradeafrica and the american negro were again linked this study was published in the annual report of the american historical association as the enforcement of the slave trade laws the first of the major du bois historical works which earned for him the title of historian was through the publication of the volume the suppression of the african slave trade to the united states of america in partial fulfillment for the degree of doctor of philosophy awarded in at harvard university du bois was years of age when he worked on this subject there were chapters and appendices embracing colonist and state legislation and typical slave trade cases in pages with voluminous footnotes and a bibliography the study won a place as the first volume of the harvard historical series daniel p mannix and malcolm cowley remark in black cargoes that the suppression of the african slave trade has not been superseded as an account of the political struggles over the trade du bois based the study on national and state historical sources colonial statutes congressional documents personal narratives and reports of antislavery societies reviews of the book in the american historical review the english historical review the annals of the american academy the atlantic monthly and the nation were on the whole quite favorable at this point in his intellectual development du bois had not evinced a serious interest in african history as such while at harvard albert bushnell hart had directed his attention to the history of the negro but there was at harvard at that time little knowledge of or interest in the history of africa four years prior to the publication of his doctoral dissertation however du bois had resolved to make a name in science to make a name in literature and thus to raise my race this decision before long led him to deepen his interest in africa by du bois was in london writing the resolutions for the first panafrican conference in an address written for the occasion du bois identified those present as men and women of african blood and declared that the history of the world both ancient and modern has given many instances of no despicable ability and capacity among the blackest races of men du bois called for the cessation of sacrificing african natives to the greed of gold cautioned against robbing them of their liberties debauching their family life and repressing their aspirations he spoke of the ruthless economic exploitation and political downfall of less developed nations and called on britain germany and france to look to the best in their traditions and promote progress and prosperity in their colonies the identification of negro american and african which du bois earlier had made an integral part of his thinking was expressed on the political plane in a passage which brought together people of african descent throughout the world let the nations of the world respect the integrity and independence of the free negro states of abyssinia liberia haiti and the rest and let the inhabitants of these states the independent tribes of africa the negroes of the west indies and america and the black subjects of all nations take courage strive ceaselessly and fight bravely that they may prove to the world their incontestible right to be counted among the great brotherhood of mankind his championing of panafricanism dates from that address which followed by years the congress of berlin at a time when practically the whole of africa was under european domination du bois was affirming the essential humanity of africans and calling for an end to the exploitation of that continent but it would not be until some years later that he would attempt to set forth the contributions to world history of the blackest races of men in franz boas spoke at atlanta university du bois was never the same after hearing the words of the great anthropologist it was boas who brought the history of africa to his attention few today are interested in negro history because they feel the matter settled the negro has no history i remember my own sudden awakening from the paralysis of this judgment taught me in high school and in two of the worlds great universities franz boas came to atlanta university where i was teaching history in and said to a graduating class you need not be ashamed of your african past and then he recounted the history of the black kingdom of the sahara for a thousand years i was too astonished to speak all of this i had never heard and came then and afterwards to realize how the silence and neglect of science can let truth utterly disappear or even be unconsciously distorted nine years later the home university library published du bois the negro a book devoted largely to african history including chapters on ethiopia and egypt african culture the slave trade and the west coast of africa the book was in many ways up to that time the most impressive one written by an american in the field of african history writing in the preface to the book du bois pointed out that the time has not yet come for a complete history of the negro peoples noting the fact that archaeological research had just begun in africa du bois contended that racial prejudice against darker peoples was too strong in socalled civilized centers for judicial appraisement of africa dr du bois essayed to present such short general statement of the main known facts and their fair interpretation as shall enable the general reader to know as men a sixth or more of the human race the negro was of interest to the scholar as well as to the general reader small in size but large in quality the book utilizes the theories of franz boas and guiseppi sergi additional writers on whom du bois relied in varying degrees were ibn batuta leo africanus leo frobenius h barth w d cooley lady lugard and e w blyden to name a few most africanists today will probably not subscribe to du bois viewborrowed from boasthat black african people were the first to smelt iron but his assertion that egypt was influenced by black africans is agreed upon by a significant number of scholars and his outline of west african empires seems in the main consonant with the best of modern scholarship at the time du bois wrote of these empires few scholars were willing to believe they even existed dr du bois in addition to challenging the aryan myth of superiority took issue with those who espoused the view that islam was responsible for the creation of west african states a position still subscribed to by some scholars islam did not found new states but modified and united negro states already ancient it did not initiate new commerce but developed a widespread trade already established it is as frobenius says easily proved from chronicles written in arabic that islam was only effective in fact as a fertilizer and stimulant efforts to ascribe the artistic products of yoruban civilization to the white race also came in for considerable criticism as did similar efforts so fashionable at the time the negro was writtento attribute every evidence of sophisticated achievement to the inspiration of white people du bois in concluding sets forth the thesis of class conflict and the unity of the white and black working classes for the establishment of a better society writing vigorously and succinctly wesley remarks du bois presented facts about african history and culture which were unknown in a time when the concept of racial inferiority and african savagery were rampant and dominant in the thought of the american people in the preface to black folk then and now a work published in du bois commented that he wanted to do again and i hope somewhat more thoroughly the task which i attempted twentythree years ago in a little volume of the home university library called the negro he tells the reader that some of the material of the negro is incorporated in black folk then and now but that the new book is an entirely new production and seeks to bring to notice the facts concerning the negro if not entirely according to the results of thorough scholarship at least with scholarship as good as i am able to command with the time and money at my disposal du bois does not hide the fact that in addition to his role as an historian he will be the advocate of people of african descent observing i do not for a moment doubt that my negro descent and narrow group culture have in many ways predisposed me to interpret my facts too favorably for my race but there is little danger of long misleading here for the champions of white folk are legion the negro has long been the clown of history the football of anthropology and the slave of industry i am trying to show here why these attitudes can no longer be maintained i realize that the truth of history lies not in the mouths of partisans but rather in the calm science that sits between her cause i seek to serve and wherever i fail i am at least paying truth the respect of earnest effort du bois was concerned therefore not only about the history of people of african descent but in addition with the relationship of these facts upon race prejudice in the modern world utilizing materials unavailable at the time the negro was written he seeks to reevaluate africa and its civilization in the light of these more recent findings there is a somewhat detailed discussion of the word negro one in which du bois points out the fallacy of restricting it to certain groups of africans the black and brown people of ethiopia egypt and north africa according to the american standard would be regarded as negroes not whites as certain writers designate them in essential agreement with carter woodson du bois in black folk then and now attacks the practice of designating hamitic peoples as white it is his view that millions of negroidssome of them the blackest of menunder cover of the term hamite were characteristically transferred to the white race by some eager scientists he contends that a hamite is simply a mulatto of ancient negro and semitic blood thus according to du bois the civilizations of north africa owing to the infusion of negro blood must be considered at least in part negroid civilizations a position not only attested by contemporaries such as franz boas but one which is supported by later scholars such as immanuel wallerstein of columbia university suffice it to say now for the purpose of discussing the african past that the best evidence of today seems to indicate a very great racial intermingling in africa as elsewhere over the past five thousand years and that the egyptians or hamites of yesteryear might well find themselves classified as negroes today in precisely those countries where such classifications matter suffice it further to note that many of the archaeological remains of which we shall speak at first credited to arabs or hamites have on closer or less biased inspection turned out to be unmistakably negroafrican in origin in his chapter the trade in men du bois sets forth a number of interesting theories he ascribes the decline of african culture to the slave trade which he contends robbed africa of from a fourth to a third of its population whole regions were depopulated whole tribes disappeared and the character of the people developed excesses of cruelty instead of the flourishing arts of peace and yet du bois avers people ask today the cause of the stagnation of culture in that land since there are to be sure many africanists who today would question du bois position regarding the number of people lost to the slave trade their figures being considerably more conservative than his yet few deny the contention that the impact of the trade however much it accelerated commerce and stimulated the growth of new kingdoms wreaked considerable havoc among the people whom the trade affected most du bois speaks of the great and significant contribution of the labor of blacks that the trade made available to the rise of western industry and the growth of capitalism a position that eric williams was later to develop in some considerable detail in his capitalism and slavery whatever the contribution of brawn however the human loss was staggering raphael painted luther preached corneille wrote and milton sang and through it all for years the dark captives wound to the sea amid the bleaching bones of the dead for years the sharks followed the scurrying ships for years america was strewn with the living and dying millions of a transplanted race for years ethiopia stretched forth her hands unto god something of the poetof the historian and prose writer at his best is reflected in the above passage he is more clearly the advocate in the world and africa this work includes a number of chapters on african history chapters which are in some respects quite similar to those found in the negro and black folk then and now the edition published in contains essays on panafricanism the relationship between africa and china and a variety of additional pieces which appeared originally in newspapers in the foreword of the edition however du bois describes the world and africa as not so much a history of negroid peoples as a statement of their integral role in human history from prehistoric to modern times the edition is that and more du bois sees the future of the african people linked with world socialism in this regard it is interesting to note du bois urges africans to base their socialism on the socialism of former african societies and concludes awake awake put on thy strength o zion reject the weakness of missionaries who teach neither love nor brotherhood but chiefly the virtues of in discussing the work of du bois carter woodson and others in the writing of african history august meier concludes most significant was the work of du bois not only was he aware of the complexity and sophistication of contemporary african culture but also acting more on mystic racial yearnings than on scientific investigation du bois was the precursor of the africanist melville j herkovits in tracing the american negro culture and institutions to african origins did his mystic racial yearnings cast him in the role of precursor to the later negritude movement as early as he wrote i am the smoke king i am black i am darkening with song i am hearkening to wrong i will be black as blackness can the blacker the mantle the mightier the man i am carving god in night i am painting hell in white i am the smoke king i am black the celebration of blacknessthe attempt to transmute its negative attributes into positive onesappears time and time again in the writings of du bois six years before the publication of the souls of black folk du bois gave what was perhaps the first indication that he felt the negro possessed certain peculiar artistic qualities that america could ignore only at her peril the negro said du bois in a paper submitted to the american negro academy had given america its only original music its only touch of humor and pathos amid its mad moneygetting plutocracy du bois then believed in a race spirit which he considered the greatest invention for human progress du bois belief in racial integrity was in this respect similar to that of schomburg who a few years later was to speak of kindling the torches which inspire to racial integrity the negros artistic gifts were due to subtle psychic differences which characterized all men dividing them into races he was later to develop this thesis at some length in a bookthe gift of black folk the very title of which calls to mind the views of the negritude schooof writers before the appearance of this book however du bois published the souls of black folk a work which affected not only american negroes but africans as well saunders redding reports that peter abrahams of south africa said that until he read this book he had no words with which to express his negroness abrahams himself wrote that the book had the impact of a revelation a key to the understanding of my world the dualism so prevalent in the thinking of leopold senghor aime cesaire and other proponents of negritude is expressed by du bois in the opening chapter of souls it is a peculiar sensation this doubleconsciousness this sense of always looking at ones self through the eyes of others of measuring ones soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity one ever feels his twonessan american a negro two souls two thoughts two unreconciled strivings two warring ideals in one dark body whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder and there is the same longing for a higher synthesis of which senghor speaks in referring to cross cultural fertilization he the negro would not africanize america for america has too much to offer the world and africa he would not bleach his negro soul in a flood of white americanism for he knows that negro blood has a message for the world the allusions to negro blood often appear in the writings of du bois just as senghor often refers to african blood the negro never lost his african temperament or style of life du bois asserts in the gift of black folk he refers to a peculiar spiritual quality which the negro has brought into american life and civilization a certain spiritual joyousness a sensuous tropical love of life as against new england reason which was cool and cautious a slow and dreamful conception of the universe together with an intense sensitiveness to spiritual valuesall qualities which in his view tell of the imprint of africa on europe in america there is no denying or explaining away du bois remarks this tremendous contact of the north and south of black and white of anglosaxon and negro the qualities of negritude of being negro developed deep in the forest fastness and by the banks of low vast rivers in the deep tense quiet of the jungle where the human soul whispered its folk tales carved its pictures sang its rhythmic songs and danced and danced describing the music of the slavethe spiritualdu bois hears the sorrow of riven souls suddenly articulate the sobs of raped daughters the quiver of murdered bodies the defiance of deathless hope it is great art born of suffering and tragedy in another passage from the gifts of black folk du bois describes the slave laborer as a product of the tropics who possessed sensuous receptivity to the beauty of the world and was therefore not easily reduced to the mechanical drafthorse which the northern european laborer became though often accused of laziness the slave brought to modern manual labor a renewed valuation of life du boisin affirming the emotional nature of negroes in his use of culture as a basis for group solidarity in zealously attempting to rediscover the historic roots of the negro people in positing the notion that negroeswherever they livehave a certain style of life and in his allusions to primitive african socialismwas a precursor of negritude much like cesaire his negritude theories were not hammered into a comprehensive system of thought and like cesaire they appear to derive more from his personal stand as a writer student of history and culture and black man caught between two worlds as charles wesley has written most of du bois workseven his novelshave included some material on the african background in addition to books and articles in which mention was made of africa for many years du bois promoted a pageant based on the african past a pageant designed for children it appears that his mind conceived practically every conceivable use to which african history could be put including teaching it in sunday school to youngsters this is not the place for an assessment of his work in fathering and promoting the panafrican movement let it suffice to say as has martin kilson that he had a deep spiritual attachment to and belief in africa and her peoples and in his dedication to panafricanism there was no sacrifice too great for him to bear nor any road too difficult for him to travel he has been hailed as the father of panafricanism by heads of african countries and his influence has been recognized by african leaders from kenyatta to nkrumah it can be said in perfect justice that generations of negro intellectuals changed their negative views of africa due to the influence of du bois he left the united states in his nineties and returned to africa to become a citizen of ghana and set in motion a project of which he had long dreamedthe writing of an encyclopedia africana when he died at he had at least lived to see a number of stages in the project completed more importantly however he had left behind an historic record which today corroborates the view which he espoused in at the london panafrican conference that the worlds history both ancient and modern has given many instances of no despicable ability and capacity among the blackest races of men let us suppose that by edict of some authority it was decreed that a theory similar to the nazi master race theory must be incorporated in our american history and taught in our schools certainly the public would be shocked and revolted by a decree affirming the superiority of aryans and the inferiority of jews teachers would rise in horror how could we teach this false theory how could we pervert the history of our country and commit such injury to the tender and impressionable minds of our youth but let us go on to suppose that we were compelled by an irresistible force to do what we fully knew was so shockingly wrong so repugnant to our consciences as teachers and citizens our phrases parroting the false doctrine would be labored and reluctant surely the sense of joy in teaching would become only a faint memory the sweat doubt and struggle of our creative act of teaching would be destroyed the common striving that gives joy and excitement to both students and teachers the search that is eager and hard for knowledge and understanding could no longer exist butis not all this just nightmare fantasy certainly we do not we need not violate our consciences in such a way in our american history classrooms our traditional history but why ask we dont teach the fantastic nazi master race theory no we do not we teach our own the ruling groups in the south have traditionally insisted that in their schools american history be taught from a white supremacist standpoint recent authoritative scholarship has shown that from about to world war ii the study of american history was dominated by scholars who reflected or accepted biased views in their work at the turn of the century john w burgess dean of the faculty of political science at columbia university in the introduction to his major work reconstruction and the constitution said a black skin means membership in a race of men which has never of itself succeeded in subjecting passion to reason has never therefore created any civilization of any kind it is also known that textbook publishers went even beyond the prevailing scholarly interpretations in their desire to cater to the southern market northern school systems based their teaching on these textbooks and historical interpretations thus a biased and censored version of american history became imbedded in both northern and southern classrooms we all grew up on itour traditional history this did not happen by the imposition of a triumphant dictatorship newly swept into power in a nation caught up in a mad ideological rampage no in our country this grand miswriting of history seeped into books teaching and traditions through the hard work of serious scholars aided and abetted by racial theories and in stitutions that flourished after the civil war as they had before weigh the magnitude of the issue it is often alluded to by the term negro history it is that and much more the course of race relationships with all of its ramifications for white and negro comprises one of the mainstreams of american history we can only contemplate what our history would have been and what our country would be like today if people from africa had come to america as freemen instead of being brought here as slaves clearly a wholesale distortion of the history of race relationships in the united states amounts to nothing less than a major falsification of americas past even so what are the effects they could hardly be benevolent our traditional history has been a bulwark of the prevailing system of prejudice discrimination and segregation in this nation insofar as we continue to deny a valid account of their history to our students both negro and white we continue to cripple their ability to understand and confront the dangerous and immoral racial system which remains deeprooted throughout our nation all in the name of education and at the taxpayers expense but as educators are we not also victims what other history could we know what other books could we obtain in the last two decades a new scholarship has emerged one which has effectively challenged this traditional history the works of its distinguished scholars are now widely accepted and respected in our universities furthermore the pioneering research of previously neglected historians such as carter g woodson and w e b dubois has achieved widespread recognition certainly the many articles monographs and books of these revisionist historians have been available to teachers civil_rights groups have publicized the issue as have nationally popular magazines such as saturday review time and newsweek yet how many teachers have responded to the challenge have we said there could be no more serious charge about my work i must sample this new scholarship to be able to assess it for myself i must bring this issue urgently to the attention of my colleagues since it is a professional challenge we must resolve together what would it mean in our classrooms if we taught the historythatactuallyhappened with the help of valid scholarship instead of that historythatwastransmitteddowntous let us explore a bit the imaginary melting pot how relevant to studentsand how historically accurateis the traditional introduction to an american history course students are told in the fifth grade again in the eighth grade and finally in the th grade that america is made up of a blend of many nationalitiesirish english dutch italian french and so on yet we exclude africans consider the provocative themes if we confronted the entire rainbow of america including africanamericans those forced immigrants for whom there was no melting in the imaginary pot perhaps teachers foresee some difficulty in mentioning the old world of africa we have studied some european history we know something of the great chinese civilizations and have confidence in our knowledge of the contributions of these great ancestors yet too often our studentsboth negro and whitethink of africa only as the dark continent egypt the cradle of civilization seems to have slipped into the mediterranean sea and her black men and women are lost chapters of history negro students know only too well that for them the melting pot is a myth but they must also learn that the dark continent is equally unreal should not their introduction to american history include the earliest use of the wheel the story of the civilizations of kush the empires of ghana mali and songhay the great city of timbuktu and the university of sankore with its scholars of many hues we will have provided ne gro youngsters with the ability to walk with new pride through the halls of their schools calling themselves askia the great or munsa musa and our white studentswill they gain a new breadth of knowledge and a shaken sense of superiority the freedom to destroy freedom w if it is true that we as a nation look with horror upon the mass murder by nazi germany of more than million persons and as teachers cannot overlook this aspect of teaching world war ii how can we continue to ignore the depopulation of the continent of africa as a result of slave trading historians state that in excess of million africans were taken from their homelands twothirds of these human beings perished as a result of the brutalities of the trade were not these engaged in thiseuropeans americans and africans alikecorrupted in a process whereby millions of souls were lost what of our rationale for the continued importation of africans to north america were white people really concerned with bringing the benefits of christianity and civilization to black people malcolm cowley in the introduction to black cargoes a history of the atlantic slave trade states that the slave trade left behind it a myth of negro inferiority an embittered conflict and a sense of guilt that refuses to disappear it is as if we were all responsible now for the sin of our forefathers and as if the sin was so great that not even the civil war could atone for it what response would it provoke if we placed the slave trade in its historical context of the renaissance period dr w e b du bois called the renaissance a birth of a new freedom the freedom to destroy freedom to exploit should we help our students locate the slave trade in the world forces of the renaissance the commercial revolution of european economic life the rise of national states in western europe and the foundation of the new world black americas strivings why is it after much time spent studying the civil war and its causes and effects so many american high school students have demonstrated by hostile reactions to open housing or school integration their desire to fight this war all over againamerican brother against american brother white power against black_power have we as teachers allowed this sea of ignorance to overflow into the streets of our isolated white communities have we been teaching the causes of the civil war as though the institution of slavery played no significant part if the black man in american history was viewed as a part of the events of our heritage if his hopes his ambitions his enslavement and resistance to that enslavement his manhood in fact were considered would this not help stem the swirling tide of prejudice apparently we have allowed our students to assume that slaves didnt think react to their conditions or desire freedom we must document not only the lives of the plantation slave and the household slave but the lives of the many slaves who worked in the cities of the south as carpenters mechanics shipbuilders etc richard c wade in the introduction to his book slavery in the cities the south states the important books and significant controversies have all assumed the plantation and farm to be the special setting of the institution yet from almost the beginning slavery was also urban and was in many ways quite different from its rural analogue thousands of free negroes lived both north and south and many negro men and women joined the abolitionist movement but in our classrooms they seem to get lost in a toobrief study of garrison and phillips the many national and state conventions held by negro men throughout this nation from colonial days attest to their paramount desire for freedom the eloquent statements prepared at these conventions and addressed to our national government should become a part of our storehouse of knowledge perhaps then white americans will not look with surprise upon the organizations of black americans today addressing the nation for equal rights we can learn much from the words of richard cain a negro congressman from south carolina on the floor of the house of representatives in washington in cain said to his white colleagues i am clothed with humanity like you i think i reason i talk i express my views as you do is there any difference between us not so far as our manhood is concerned unless it be in this that our opinions differ and mine are a little higher up than yours in fact only a small minority of whites worked actively against the racial system and received rather little honor for their efforts is it not reasonable to assume that black americas strivings were more in keeping with our espoused democracy than white americas actions lincoln was not our man it should come as no surprise that nearly negroes fought for their freedom in the civil war when we are aware of the thousands of negroes who died attempting to revolt against the system that enslaved them and their loved ones negroes will come alive in the pages of history when their debates with each other and with white abolitionists and revolutionists become a part of the drama of the classroom we must ask such fundamental questions as the following did frederick douglass agree with john brown what about the negroes who were with john brown when he raided harpers ferry what motivated them did frederick douglass simply support a braham lincoln and not disagree with him when douglass summed up his measure of lincoln at the unveiling of the freedmens monument to the man he said lincoln was not in the fullest sense of the word either our man or our model in his interests in his associations in his habits of thought and in his prejudices he was a white man we are at best only his stepchildren children by adoption children by force of circumstance and necessity but we entreat you to despise not the humble offering we this day unveil to view for while abraham lincoln saved for you a country he delivered us from a bondage according to jefferson one hour of which was worse than ages of the oppression your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose should not our students confront the great emancipator as a man as well as a myth the measure of racism an historical phenomenon the days of reconstruction following the civil war offer the most meaningful backdrop upon which to sketch the events of the recent freedom movements in the south unfortunately if we have not provided that backdrop we cannot expect our students to live in a changing society with a sense of appreciation for the historic events which have occurred since rosa parks sat down in the white section of a bus in montgomery as negroes protest their inability to vote in america today we should be able to contrast and compare the events of a hundred years ago in the same counties of the south instead too many history texts today write off the reconstruction period as a blackout of honest government we teach that money was spent unwisely during reconstruction without stating the many reforms instituted which cost extra moneythe establishment of the first public school system in the south for example we decry the carpetbaggers without realizing that many dedicated northerners went south to teach and help rebuild people and places we ignore the many black men who were free and educated in europe canada and the north during the slave period and decided to return to the south to help reconstruct their people and governmentwhich now included them we must examine carefully the black codes the documents of the early reconstruction written by white men desiring a return to slavery and the birth of the klan which gave strength to these laws then compare these codes to the new constitutions written three years later in by both negro and white men attempting to build a democracy in their southern states we find in the speeches of negro congressmen elected from their southern states to the senate and the house from the s to the words of men who were proud to be black and spoke eloquently for lasting civil_rights congressman richard cain directed the following remarks to white southern congressmen who opposed an civil_rights bill there are periods in the histories of nations and of peoples when it is necessary that men belonging to a race or races whose rights and interests are at stake should lay aside all feelings of delicacy and hesitation and vindicate their rights their character and their nationality i have been surprised at their attempts to ridicule and cast a slur upon a race of men whose labor has enabled them and theirs for years to feed and drink and thrive and fatten the debates on that bill in should be contrasted with debates on recent civil_rights legislation what eagerness young people have for the truths which will give them the ability to understand the history which they view each day in their newspapers and on television screens place the plessy vs ferguson decision of the compromise speech of booker t washington in the rewriting of each southern state constitution and the period of the white mans burden in the philippines hawaii and cuba in into the context of the racism of the new political leaders of this period when we see this complete picture of the birth of jim crow we can understand better the need for a civil_rights revolution to put an end to jim crow today have our students had a chance to dig into the tortured history of white supremacy as it developed in and affected white society in what kind of trap did white society blindly entangle itself as it pursued its massive attempts to crush the humanity of black people in southern white society before the civil war free speech and political processes were denied to any who would voice opposition to slavery violence was imbedded in the life of the communitywhether shown by the scars that marked the bodies of many slaves or by the semimilitary pattern of life in a land ever fearful of revolt a superbly ingenious moral hypocrisy imbued the thought patterns of its citizenry spokesmen of the south trump eted its superior morality and civilization while its businessmen protected by law tore apart the families of fellow humans southern economic progress was stultified under the slave system public education lagged far behind the other regions and its system of justice was subverted to the cause of human chatteldom all this is past the slaves were freed but racism became entrenched in america and when will we be free of it can our students then take the measure of racism in america as an historical phenomenon its depth scope nature and future men we shall have the record of the pastas it is transmitted to usis a living force today our traditional history is part of our consciousness it expresses itself in our daily thoughts and emotions in our interpretations of current events and our responses to these events those who wrote the traditional history which has been incorporated in textbooks and classrooms are still guiding our understanding and attitudes what they wrought is one of the keystones of the structure of racism that prevails in this country today that integrity in history is sacrificed to racial bias should be no surprise the fundamental premise of racismthat one group is superior in human qualities and the other inferioris itself false white supremacy needed a falsified na tional history to protect its original lieand got it negro children must attend school under our compulsory school laws there they are taught a history which on the one hand is compounded of prevarications based on white supremacist assumptions and which on the other hand robs them of their heritage as people of african descent and as citizens of this country what more could we do to undermine psychologically a group of unprotected children this is lying and stealing on a vast insidious and devastating scale white children too have been denied the history of their country what illusions fears and anxieties have been created as a consequence what intellectual emotional and moral disabilities have been born is this then what is happening in classrooms across america is this what we call our creative act of teachingleading our children to the poisonous wells of racist history can teachers fulfill their responsibility without knowledge of the best of modern scholarship can we simply depend upon a new textbook or must we dig into the writings of franklin woodward woodson stampp du bois and others we need not try to become experts but we should explore enough to grasp the major themes and issues to be able to consider to judge and to change this would take time and effort but the new american history this negro history and the history of white racismwhat compelling shocking reading many doubts will arise doubts about the ability to change the difficulties of change there will be inward struggle as old knowledge and attitudes resist the impact of new experience and there will be struggle in the classroom new materials new concepts new objectives how will the students respond and fellow teachers administrators parents but this struggle is not a new one the prophetic du bois sixtyfour years ago challenged teachers with the issue and the hope that lies in it malcolms essential content was so simple and elemental his arguments like thoreaus so unanswerable that the american press even when not covertly racist could not understand him accustomed as it is to the settled contradictions of civil logic in a biracial country what answer is there to the accusations that in a large part of america a century after the th amendment some kinds of murderers cannot be punished by law that the law is the murderer is it an answer that we must tolerate injustice so that we may enjoy justice contemning such deformed logic and adhering to obvious moral truths malcolm like the bogalusa deacons had little difficulty in understanding and explaining to his audiences the thomistic conception of law better than the attorney general of the united states understands it malcolm was always disconcerted when the powers that be and their exponents refused to recognize the legality of humanity his strongest vocal emphases were on words like law and right they dont use law he exclaimed of the central congolese government which was directed by outside interests and the lawfulness of the eastern government was more valid he thought because it was of its own people justice and equity and emancipation not violence not hatred not retribution and not the theology of the muslims were the central matter of malcolms oratory though that theology was useful as a repudiation of american white christianity he had entered the stream of sane and moral social teaching before his parting from elijah muhammad and was deepening his knowledge and expression of it at the moment of the death he expected each day john illo the rhetoric of malcolm_x in the columbia university forum in the american south the system of justice is crude barbaric and savage there are few parallels for it in a civilized society it is a system which enables whites to murder or maim negroes with scarcely any fear of retribution it is a system which provides for the savage cruel punishment of negroes for crimes they did or did not commit hundreds of examples can be given of this shameless thriving barbarism it is true that american liberals are vigorously fighting this system it is true that american newspapers far from hiding the evil brutal system of southern justice are exposing and condemning it but it is equally true that the system persists with the american public people standing by and doing nothing effective about it it is a grave indictment of their country that such horrors should continue joel mervis editor of south africas johannesburg times in the louisville courierjournal since july of millions of moviegoers in this country and throughout the world have seen the spectacular motion picture khartoumin cinerama ultrapanavision and technicolor some movie critics have hailed this picture as nothing less than superb and the most realistic battle action in movie history others have said that this is historical truth brought to the screen this is where the appraisers have erred the truth about the battle for the sudan in the s has been distorted to suit the needs and prejudices of the hollywood movie czars and their subjects who are mainly white the picture stars charlton heston as general charles gordon the enigmatic british mystic who was sent to the sudan in central africa to rescue an egyptian army and thousands of british civilians besieged in khartoum by the nationalist uprising of muhammad ahmad the mahdi and his devoted followers in the picture and in the extensive advertisements about it the mahdi is depicted as an arab religious fanatic he was both religious and a fanatical african nationalist but he was not an arab he was a moslem very often when it suits the antiafrican propaganda purpose of most white writers and nearly all white motion picture makers africans who are moslems and heroes are called arabs this infers that they are white men by this not so subtle method people of african descent all over the world are robbed of heroes that rightfully belong to them the motion picture khartoum is a case in point the black writer must now examine and sometimes challenge all interpretations of the history of his people and their heroes that have been made by other people for an examination of the life and times of muhammad ahmad known as the mahdi a few questions are in order who was this man and what is the significance of his fight to free the sudan from british and egyptian rule what is the importance of his country and his people what indeed is the real mahdi story the sudan is an old african country and it has not always been called the sudan it was once a part of the biblical land of kush and has also been known as nubia or bilad alnuba the arabs called the country bilad alsudan meaning the land of the blacks from the early part of the sixteenth century to the latter part of the nineteenth century the sudan was dominated by a series of invaders who ruled recklessly and taxed the people without mercy or any consideration for their well being corruption and injustice went unopposed for years until in a great leader appeared to unite the sudanese people against their oppressors his name was muhammad ahmadibnseyyidabdullah his career is synonymous with the title mahdi meaning one who is divinely directed when muhammad ahmad assumed the mahdiship in he was under he was born in august on an island in the nile river called labab in the province of dongala his family claimed to be descendants of the prophet mahomet though they were humble boat builders while muhammad ahmads brothers followed their fathers trade he displayed an aptitude for religious studies muhammad ahmad the youngest of his parents four sons was sent to a khalwa school to learn reading and writing and to commit the koran to memory his interest and enthusiasm inspired his teachers to send him to a second school in khartoum and a third one in the gezira where he completed his studies of the koran and then studied muslim laws and traditions later he journeyed to the city of berber to pursue religious studies at the hands of the sheikh mahed el kheir the renowned religious leader of the time the most notable of his many teachers was sheikh muhammad sharif by muhammad ahmad had acquired a large following and was proclaimed the mahdithe future savior of the sudan the mahdi having challenged the authority of the government had no option but to prepare for the jihad or holy war in defense of islam and for the freedom of the sudan he started to train his followers and to prepare his flags on which he inscribed there is no god but god muhammad is his prophet and the mahdi is his caliph the government detachments landed in aba in the middle of a dark night in the rainy season the soldiers felt their way towards the village amongst grass and bush and lagoons all of a sudden the mahdists fell on them using swords and spears and giving them no time to use their firearms the majority of the soldiers lost their lives and the small number that escaped the disaster fled to khartoum in their steamers the mahdists rejoiced in their first triumph and in the spoils of arms and ammunition left behind which they could use in days to come that was on august the mahdist revolution against the turkoegyptian regime had started the mahdi and his followers automatically became rebels after the incident at aba as their island was within easy reach of the government and as they were still in a minority they deemed it wise to migrate west far way from the government and to unite with their allies and associates in kordofan and the nuba mountains the mahdi and his small group of followers crossed the white nile from aba on their way westward they were continually joined by followers until they reached taqali in taqali king adam umm dabbalu gave them a hearty reception and promised them his protection the mahdi and his followers then moved to jabal qadir the attempts of the governor of kordofan to intercept their progress failed and the mahdists reached jabal qadir in safety there they were joined by the inhabitants of the surrounding mountains who flocked to join the mahdist cause others from the different parts of the sudan then journeyed in large numbers to join the mahdi and to take part in the new mission and in the struggle against the government all internal attempts to nip the mahdist revolution in the bud failed it then became imperative for egypt assisted by great britain to face the situation a large army was conscripted out of the disrupted egyptian nationalist army of urabi pasha and others and sent to khartoum by sea via suakin as soon as preparations were complete for an expedition against the mahdi the army under the command of hicks pasha moved forward the expedition first followed the white nile southwards to al dueim then it struck westward into a country most hostile to it in order to come within range of the mahdists the scouts of the mahdist army lost no chance of attacking them whenever circumstances allowed and in compliance with the orders of the mahdists the villages on the route of the turkoegyptian army were evacuated and the wells filled with earth the country through which the army was to pass was thus left desolate of inhabitants and short of drinking water as the situation of the army grew more pathetic every day differences of opinion between ala aldin pasha and hicks pasha the leaders of the army sharpened when hicks pashas expedition reached alrahad after a long and tiring march and then moved towards kazgail the mahdist hordes from el obeid and those who joined them from the baqqare jimas tribe under their sheikh asakir abu alkalam had arrived on the scene as hicks army was marching out of kazgail and entering the forest of shaykan the mahdists fell on them and a fierce battle raged for a whole day hicks army was annihilated almost to the last soldier in november with the defeat of hicks expedition the government lost its last disciplined army and most of its men and stores in the sudan what remained of the armies of the government were distributed in small garrisons defending the remaining posts those garrisons could not be depended upon in the governments struggle against mahdism the victorious mahdi then returned to el obeid to allow his armies the wellearned rest they required after their long struggle against the government to receive more disciples and followers and to start a new victorious era in the annals of the revolution soon afterwards slatin bey governor of darfur surrendered his province and became a prisoner of the mahdi for a very long time from el obeid the mahdi also sent emissaries and small forces to preach mahdism and to harass the remaining garrisons of the turkiya so the west succumbed to mahdism and the central sudan associated itself with it in the eastern sudan osman digna the mahdist hero who joined mahdism on the fall of el obeid and who was dispatched by the mahdi in the capacity of a mahdist amir to preach mahdism was able to win the tribes of the red sea hills to the mahdist cause they then began to harass the government headquarters in the eastern sudan he captured sinkat and laid siege to the government garrisons in suakin and tokar from his headquarters near suakin osman digna continually attacked the government garrisons in suakin and tokar while the mahdists moved from one victory to the other in the west now muhammad ahmad and general gordon at khartoum became rival claimants for supremacy over the minds of the sudanese people they were also rivals in another sense for both of them claimed to be the messengers of god the mahdi called himself muhammad ahmad el mahdi monutazer that is to say the prophet and guide awaited by the world his followers had already adopted the cry of muhammad ahmad rassoul allah nili allah roughly translated muhammad the messiah and messenger of allah of the many rumors that were being circulated about him and his followers one was that he intended to invade egypt to convert the mussulmen to the true faith from which they had strayed and after a massacre of the christians in egypt to go to mecca the holy city of his faith where he expected to receive the khalifat and be ordained the grand cheikh of islam the future battle lines had been drawn and both contestants had been pushed beyond the point where a compromise could be reached the mahdi was invited to khartoum to be examined in the koran to see if he was really the expected messiah he rejected the invitation and sent back the message by the grace of god and his holy prophet i am master in the sudan never shall i come to khartoum to justify myself with this sort of preaching he struck the right chord in the character of the moslem and all other sudanese tribes his plan was to unite all in one great faith wisely for his scheme he recognized the general state of discontent and most astutely used it as a fertile ground for his message he was a religious leader but he also was a shrewd politician he based arguments on the prevailing hard times and traced these to the existing government his astuteness was again shown in the way he selected as the field of his earliest efforts the most disturbed section of the country the british authorities offered a large sum for him dead or alive this action forced the mahdi to declare a holy war he promised his rapidly increasing followers the majority share of the spoils he intended to take from the oppressors a quarrel developed between the commanders sent to seize the mahdi the quarrel broke into an open fight and the two separate companies of soldiers were weakened to ineffectiveness the mahdi and his followers fell on these troops with clubs sharp sticks and stones in a short while they were destroyed then came the mahdis attempt to capture el obeid the capital of kordofan and though driven back with great losses he prevailed until after a siege of five months the town and garrison surrendered now he was hailed as the maker of miracles praise allah the messiah had come the government no longer looked upon him as a holy man zealous for religion but poor and without influence whom they could silence easily the government had already come to be despised by the people because of its weakness and corruption while the prestige of muhammad ahmad was in the ascendency the spirit of rebellion which prevailed in egypt no doubt helped to augment fanaticism in the sudan the government again sent for muhammad and he again refused to go there now followed in surprisingly rapid succession defeat after defeat for the government and success after success for the mahdi now the personality and activity of the mahdi stirred the whole of the sudanand the hopeless became hopeful and the leaderless had found a leader from the hills and the plains deserts and forests the tribes rallied to the black flag of the mahdi and pledged allegiance to his crusade tens of thousands of them the selem baggara risega homer dirrka bongo madi and bari poured into the new messiahs camp they came on horseback and on foot armed with rifles and lances or with homemade spears some were the poorest of the poor and wore only filthy loin cloths the british and the egyptians braced themselves against this tide and reshuffled their plans and forces still the tribes gathered thicker in the mahdis camp they had but one goal in view freedom or paradise the british realizing that they were about to be pushed out of the sudan brought in their most able general charles george gordon better known as chinese gordon he had served in this region before and already had a respected reputation there he was known to most of the people and liked by a large number of them gordon was a devout christian and like the mahdi had illusions of being divinely endowed when gordon arrived at khartoum he found the situation more desperate than the force at his command could master knowing the country and its people better than most englishmen he decided to use diplomacy after the collapse of his illadvised attempts to bring the exslave trader zobeir pasha to his assistance he finally had to deal directly with the mahdi gordon offered to make the mahdi governorgeneral of a large province the mighty mahdi interpreted this gesture as an insult and ridiculed gordon for making itthinking why should he be a mere governorgeneral of a province when the whole of the sudan except one or two places was already his in reply he urged gordon to forsake his devout christian beliefs and become a moslem to gordon this of course was unthinkable being a practical military man he knew that he did not have the power he needed to defend khartoum he sent the women and children out of the city and awaited the mahdi who arrived soon afterward and laid siege to the city after the siege had lasted many months the british sent an expedition of men under the command of lord wolsley to support general gordons army at khartoum lord wolsley whose victory over the egyptians at telekebir in was the decisive factor in establishing british rule over egypt proceeded up the nile with his expedition in boats hoping to reach general gordon before his army was overrun by the mahdis dedicated adherents at abu klea he met part of the mahdis forces and won a victory in the battle that followed while suffering heavy losses the bright memory of lord wolsleys victory barely had time to become real before his second in command general stewart was beaten and killed after weeks of hardship part of lord wolsleys expedition reached omdurman a few miles from khartoum in the journey the british ships had to sail through severe attacks by moslem krupp guns lord wolsleys success at abu klea and in bringing the expedition up the nile was a commendable feat of leadership but it did not save general gordon two days before his arrival january khartoum had fallen to the mahdis army the long day siege ended when of the mahdis fanatical army swarmed over the ramparts of the battlescarred city and surrounded the palace of governorgeneral gordon gordon a stalwart soldier to the end walked calmly out on the steps where a giant kordofan soldier follower of the mahdi ran him through with a spear an officer named nisser beheaded him with his sword hundreds of soldiers plunged their spears into his body his head was sent to the mahdi who at least admired him as a soldier and had hoped to make him a moslem convert the story of gordons attempt to save the sudan for england was all the more pathetic because his task showed every indication of failure before he set himself to it the fall of khartoum and gordons tragic end was a severe blow to english pride that might have been avoided to add to this another expedition composed of english and egyptian soldiers was defeated with great losses at kassala by the mahdis most able general osman digna general gordon had made the city of khartoum his headquarters then had been hemmed in on all sides until the city was cut off from the outside world while his supplies of food guns and ammunition were used up in a lost and hopeless cause he had stood bravely to his port trying to inspire a hundred men to do the work of thousands then being baffled and harassed by the shiftlessness and incompetency of his officers he made promises he could not keep until his word as an englishman began to fall on unlistening ears yet he inspired a listless population to resist for days then came the night attack and the father and saviour of the sudan lay dead in the midst of this chaos lord wolsley retreated to cairo with what remained of his army later bent on avenging his and englands honor he asked for a chance to attack the mahdi again and was permitted to do so he returned the same year with white troops and was beaten back now england withdrew from all of sudan except the port of suakin which could be defended by warships the mahdi prevailed over the rest of the sudan the mahdi and his forces crossed the west bank of the white nile and there in the desert laid the foundation of the capitol of his new kingdom he was now supreme master of a rich empire miles long and miles wide his subjects had been gathered from every district and tribe some gave him homage willingly some through fear the mahdis ambition was still running high he thought of himself as another mohammed he planned to bring all adjoining territories under his rule subdue the christian part of ethiopia march into egypt and convert the world to islam his amazing career ended before any of these dreams were realized on june six months after the death of general gordon he died of typhoid fever with his last strength he shouted the islam creed his followers mourned him for months and later erected a magnificent tomb on the spot where he died the mahdi was succeeded by his second in command khalifa abdullahi who ruled the country for troublesome years before the british gave lord kitchener enough men to reconquer the sudan in avenging what he thought was englands honor lord kitchener showed no mercy and considered nothing to be sacred while he was accomplishing his mission he more than earned the title the butcher of omdurman he bombarded the tomb of the mahdi took his bones and threw them into the nile it was said that mahdis head was packed in a kerosene tin and later used by kitchener as a tobacco container in spite of lord kitchener and those who came after him the followers of the mahdi continued to fight the british until about in the many books and papers written about him the mahdi became a romantic hero in the eyes of some of the englishmen who had fought him in his introduction to the book the mahdi of allah by richard a bermann the late winston churchill said the life of the mahdi is a romance in miniature and wonderful as that of mohammed himself the rebellion of the sudan was the last great outburst of the bloodred flower of islam the mahdi and his caliphate might well have endured to today and developed as stately a power as the moors in spain as for the unanswered questionwas muhammad ahmad the mahdi really a messiah well millions of people in the sudan believed he was and some still do but let this truth suffice the mahdi and his successors were rightfully fighting against injustice and colonial misrule among other reasons the aftermath of this fight moved the british to adopt a more humane and enlightened administration in the sudan this policy eventually helped to make the sudan the free and independent country we know today he occasion a historic t one was the consecration of most rev harold perry a negro in new orleans as the procession of prelates and priests filed through the entrance of the stately basilica of st louis king of france an onlooker muttered to his companion next thing you know these catholics will be having a colored pope a man of such obviously discriminating tastes deserves to be told the truth africa has given popes as well as saints and martyrs to the church so commented pope paul vi in giving his apostolic blessing to africa on the occasion of the canonization of the martyrs of uganda the negro popes referred to by the present holy father were victor i melchiades and gelasius all three are honored in the church as saints at least one of them victor was a martyr for the faith each contributed mightily to the development of the church in the crucial centuries following its foundation victor a native african became pope in the year and reigned for years in church history he invariably gets honorable mention for his part in settling the controversy then raging in rome on the matter of when the pivotal feast of easter should be celebrated at that time a large colony of asiatic christians lived in rome the exile asians observed easter with great pomp and ceremony as well as with feasting while the christians of rome were still subject to the rigors of lent victor called for conformity concerning easter throughout the church when the bishops of asia minor proved reluctant to change their traditional time of observance pope victor promptly excommunicated them and despite appeals from the west on their behalf stuck fast for several years to the sentence he had pronounced nor did he relent until the observance of easter on the sunday immediately following the forty days of lent was universal though the easter controversy would arise in a new form in later times when the church had spread to the british isles it was settled for all of what was christendom in his day by the vigorous victor ever efficient and methodical pope victor called the first roman synod of history he also declared latin the official language of the church despite the evergrowing use of the vernacular in church functions today this decree is still in effect so meticulous was pope victor in his guardianship of morals that he is credited with writing a treatise on the evils of playing dice less elegantly known in modern times as shooting craps his only extant writings however deal exclusively with the easter controversy pope victor was the scourge of the heretics of his era most aggressive were the gnostics but victor faced them fearlessly he also tackled theodotus a leather goods merchant who denied the divinity of christ he excommunicated the impious heretic blastus with a name like that he was simply asking for it for himself and his followers during the pontificate of pope victor the emperors persecution of the christians was suspended due to the intercession of marcia an influential lady of the imperial household when victor gave marcia a list of the christians who had been sentenced to slavery in the sardinian mines she arranged for their release pope victor effectively took advantage of the period of peace to advance the cause of the still small and struggling christian church his great contribution to christianity was achieved by his vigorous pronouncements by the power of his pen st jerome called him the foremost latin writer in the church and above all by his benign personality which won him universal respectpope victor i died a martyr in the year his burial place was close to that of st peter apostle and first martyrpope july th is the feastday of pope st victor the next negro to occupy the chair of peter was melchiades of africa also known as miltiades or milziadus prior to his accession the church had been considerably weakened by imperial persecution and by internal strife his immediate predecessors popes marcellus and eusebius had both been deposed and sent into exile after the death of eusebius in sicily there followed two years of turmoil and confusion during which the papal throne remained vacant when miltiades was elected pope in he faced a formidable task soon however the policy of persecuting the christians was abandoned in both east and west and after the accession of constantine as emperor the church finally emerged from the catacombs pope miltiades set out to salvage and to reconstruct the battered and broken bark of peter in this he proved to be a willing and skillful craftsman in the lateran palace restored to christian possession by the wife of constantine miltiades presided over a synod of bishops most important item on the agenda was a discussion on the state of the church in africa where a heretic donatus had done much damage by his intrigues donatus was condemned by the synod and once again matters ecclesiastical flourished duce the to pro in africa soon great augustine writing of his fellowcountryman st augustine referred to pope miltiades as an excellent pontiffthough his rule of the church was of short duration about four years miltiades accomplished much for the church he provided the strong leadership required in a time of transition pope miltiades died in significantly he who had arranged an honorable burial for his exiled predecessor eusebius was by his own wishes it would seem buried in the same cemetery area of the catacombs the cemetery of st calixtus they were the last popes to be interred in the catacombs the feastday of pope st miltiades is december the third negro pope was st gelasius born in rome of african parents and member of the roman diocesan clergy at the time of his election to the papacy the eastern church with headquarters at constantinople was in schism from rome euphemius patriarch of constantinople returned to the faith but refused to consider his former associate acacius a heretic gelasius made it clear that he would not restore euphemius to the full honors of the patriarchate till the diptych honoring acacius was removed from the walls of constantinoples principal church encountering obstinacy on the part of euphemius pope gelasius stood firm in reply to appeals from bishops of the west the pope pointed out that his attitude toward euphemius was not a personal matter but one of principle pope gelasius resented imperial interference in ecclesiastical matters in a letter to the emperor anastasius the pope defined the functions of church and state and pointed out that the ideal relationship between them was that they should be ancillary and not antagonistic to each other this letter is still frequently quoted when churchstate controversies arise possibly as a result of this widely hailed letter pope gelasius enjoyed a friendlier relationship with emperor theodoric the successor of anastasius many of his own roman flock caused grief to the heart of the good gelasius by their return to superstitious practices particularly in connection with the revived pagan festival of lupercal gelasius condemned christian participation in the rites particularly those associated with fertility it would seem however that some of the more innocent customs were permitted to continue and to this toleration we most likely owe the sentimental observance of st valentines day a feature of the lupercalia held at mid february was the relatively harmless juno februata this part of the celebration centered on a drawing of names for the purpose of matrimonial matchmaking the practice some say was christianized by associating it with the feast of st valentine which coincided with the date of juno februata in any case pope gelasius was successful in restoring the superstitious dissidents to the integrity of the faith his writings reveal that he was a man of deep learning the letter to emperor anastasius on church and state establishes him as the first political science writer of christianity in addition he was an authority on the matter of papal infallibility as a liturgist he left his mark by introducing better order more beauty and added stateliness into church services pope gelasius led a humble prayerful and ascetical life just and charitable to all he was especially considerate of the poor dionysius exiguus th century scholar wrote of pope gelasius that he was more a servant than a sovereign the great gelasius died in his feast is observed on november the christians of roman africa comprising the communities of tripoli algeria and morocco contributed greatly to the strength and growth of the church in the first five centuries despite occasional heresy and almost constant contro versy by however the church was virtually extinct in africa because of the inroads of the vandals soon followed by the savage mohammedan conquest the moslem territory of north africa has remained closed to christianity ever since missionary efforts in central and southern africa however have been remarkably successful in modern times the first negro bishop afterwards archbishop of the new christian era in africa was most rev joseph kiwanuka when pope pius xii consecrated him in rome on may th the holy father made it clear that the appointment of africans as bishops was no mere gesture of goodwill or a benign nod to native aspirations in you pope pius said i reestablish the african hierarchy which was interrupted by the invasion of the vandals centuries ago you must work very hard because it is by your success that i shall judge whether or not i should appoint new african bishops while attending the recent council sessions archbishop kiwanuka could look around the conclave and see two african cardinals and more than african bishops back home in africa were million catholics and an everincreasing native clergy and sisterhood africas major seminaries and minor seminaries were engaged in training the more than african candidates for the priesthood while still other native sons pursued their studies at rome and at various european seminaries all this was achieved in a relatively short period of ecclesiastical history the man who symbolizes the remark able african catholic progress of his era archbishop kiwanuka died in march of having served his people for more than years as parish priest seminary professor bishop and finally archbishop the blood of martyrs being the seed of christians it is not surprising that in uganda where lay african catholics were martyred years ago there are now two million catholics in a total population of seven million in our own day the martyrdom of priests brothers and sisters in the congo representing religious communities and nationalities testifies to the intrepid apostolic thrust in modern africa and promises an even greater growth of catholicism on the continent a new era of missionary activity is about to begin in africa declared cardinal laurian rugambwa africas distinguished first cardinal speaking at a symposium in dublin ireland recently though only a small percentage of negroes in the united states are catholic they presently are represented in the episcopate by the auxiliary bishop of new orleans his excellency bishop perry a negro prior was elected in by the community of st maurs abbey in kentucky conversions to catholicism among the negroes of the u s amount to about a year the number of negro priests and sisters is advancing steadily the growing prestige among the catholic negroes of the world may well develop to the point where it will produce popes for the universal church once more though that muttering man in new orleans betrayed such a limited knowledge of church history his forecast of the future seems very well founded indeed last november edward w brooke then attorney general of the commonwealth of massachusetts was elected to the s senate as a republican and became the first known negro u s senator since when blanche kelso bruce of mississippi left the upper house of congress mr brooke took his seat in the senate in january becoming the third known negro to occupy a seat in the us senate the other senator being hiram revels like his distinguished predecessors mr brooke brings background of superior education and accomplishment all three graduated from college and one revels was a college president it might be useful here to point out that contrary to the myth established and perpetuated by southernsympathizing writers and historians the negroes who served in the us congress were far from the illiterate this christ shamed us by his pigmentation so obviously not our own he condemned us for our blackness for our flat noses for our kinky hair for our power our strange power of expressing emotion in singing and shouting and dancing he was sedate so genteel so white and as soon as we were able many of us tried to be like him for a growing number of bold young black people all that is past they fling out their declaration no white christ shall shame us again we are glad to be black we rejoice in the darkness of our skin we celebrate the natural texture of our hair we extol the rhythm and vigor of our songs and shouts and dances and if your american christ doesnt like that you know what you can do with him that is black_power a repudiation of the american culturereligion that helped to create it and a quest for a religious reality more faithful to our own experience these young people say to america we know your christ and his attitude toward africa we remember how his white missionaries warned against africas darkness and heathenism against its savagery and naked jungle heart we are tired of all that this africa that you love and hate but mostly fearthis is our homeland we saw you exchange your bibles for our land we watched you pass out tracts and take in gold we heard you teach hymns to get our diamonds and you control them still if this is what your christ taught you he is sharp baby he is shrewd but hes no savior of ours we affirm our homeland and its great black past a past that was filled with wonder before your white scourge came you can keep your christ well take our home that is black_power a search for roots in a land that has denied us both a past and a future and the american christ who has blessed the denial earns nothing but scorn from black_power and the american christ by vincent harding in the christian century janet stevensons novel sisters and brothers crown records a situation common in the united states where miscegenation is so far advanced that the majority of its black population are brown yellow or white in complexion today so many white negroes have passed into the white race that it would not be surprising if some of our most virulent congressmen governors ku kluxers or white citizens councilmen were discovered to have negro blood like the ku klux klan official who recently committed suicide when his jewish identity was disclosed the difference in this book which is based on the history of an actual family is that the family acknowledges their negro relatives angelina and sarah grimke sisters of a charleston south carolina slaveholding family were so opposed to slavery that they joined the quakers moved to the north and engaged in antislavery agitation after the civil war they discover they have two negro nephews attending lincoln university in pennsylvania the book tells how the white and the black members of the family finally come together with many flashbacks to the previous experiences of the sisters and the boys janet stevenson has done her research well in the negro caravan edited by brown davis and lee theres an article by angelina weld grimke the daughter of one of the boys in the novel which describes her grandmother her father and her uncles and the novel is true to her descriptions her father archibald grimke became a lawyer an author and a distinguished negro leader who won a spingarn medal she herself was a poet whose poems are included in the negro caravan and other anthologies one troubling thing about thnovel is that janet stevenson seems to have an ambivalent attitude toward her characters such epithets as evil or rignteous applied to men or conduct might have been apropos in a writer of harriet beecher stowes time now after freuds revelations of the dubious motivation of seemingly virtuous actions such epithets have a connotation of scorn disapprobation or satire when used by or about the characters the abolitionists have been too long maligned by biased writers and historians historian david donald sneers at abolitionist charles sumner claude bowers is horrified at white northerners who went south and treated negroes like equal human beings fictionists like margaret mitchell romanticize the old south an act comparable to calling dachau a summer resort yes the planters had a good time so did the s s men actually the abolitionists could have enjoyed all the privileges of the dominant race in america but in undertaking the antislavery fight they faced hostility ostracism mobs and death negro slaves showed what the south was really like by their acts of resistance by malingering lying stealing sabotage running away poisoning arson mutiny and armed revolt which were necessary means of defense against men who had all the law and the power on their side and who presumed to buy sell beat maim torture and murder them aside from her nuances of language which imply a disparaging attitude toward her abolitionist characters janet stevensons novel is wellwritten the many flashbacks do not obtrude as technical devices they immediately engulf the reader in the past make vivid the hazards faced by the abolitionists the slaves and free negroes and explain and intensify the emotion of the present from the beginning of the story the reader anticipates a confrontation between the white and the black grimkes mrs stevenson heightens suspense by delaying the scene until near the end of the book the readers interest is held and his suspense tautened until the last word of the last page the new revised edition of barrons profiles of american colleges barrons educational series soft cover is billed as the equivalent of a personal visit to each campus compiled by benjamin fine the former education editor of the new york times the book is comprehensive and concise the colleges and universities are listed according to states and the quality and effectiveness of the school curriculum can be judged from the objective information supplied in his introduction mr fine sets up an example by which students seeking a college may appraise themselves and their needs and possibilities he also offers advice on selecting the appropriate school and directs the student in making a decision there is information relative to methods of paying for an education there also is a brief bibliography of further reading materials for the interested person a thoroughly useful guide it has some pages and includes an index it was ridiculous to i have an issue of such an insipidly written magazine in the apartment he knew nevertheless he picked it up again and began to read the article written about himself the audacity of it and the incredible and insane arrogance it suggested made him feel helpless against the terrible tide of consciousness so established and so knowledgeable to him and to his people his brains were sealed signed for and delivered like his body would have been in the previous century he focused his eyes and finished the article his black hands and black eyes drooping wearily over the side of the plush gold sofa then he lay down upon it keeping his shoes on it was not very comforting at all the article stated clearly that his childhood dream had been to pursue and to possess a blonde goddess that he could never be happy without her it made fun of a black entertainer he had dated it said he paid her to give him his freedom there was no picture of her but there was a listing and pictures of national and international ladies with fair hair to whom he had been linked romantically at one time or another there was a picture of him with his wifehis wife bright and grinning and his teeth matching her fairness kilometer for kilometer his hair was falling into his eyes it always seemed to be falling into his eyes whenever he was playing golf or driving or dancing or singing and he always had to toss his head give his neck a quick snappy jerk in order to keep his tumbling hair neat it always got into his eyes he bent over to light a cigarette the hair fell into his eyes he used his free hand to brush it back knowing that it would tumble into his eyes again his wife entered the room she was very very white he had asked her to stay out of the sun and the black maid entered with a tray of beverages the children liked the maid and his wife liked the maid he hated her she was almost as black as himself and her hair was short he always felt like singing an old downhome blues whenever he saw her i dont want no woman if her hair aint no longern mine she aint nothing but trouble and keep you worried all the time but no matter how much hatred he showed towards her the woman was always kind and serene yet there was the very faintest hint of laughter and incredible mockery in her eyes when she looked at him he knew the look he himself had given it to others many times he remembered the party in greenwich village the interracial party with all the loud music and the loud dancing which belonged to a younger time than now l j there was a colored girl there he was told but all the girls looked of the same race because there was not the brightest lighting still he thought that he would know a sapphire if he saw one the girls white date had laughed at him for saying this and slapped him on the back he had felt so clever so able to take it so free so optimistic so in and that was when he knew that he could make it if he chose to make it in the big world of the american dream and this world as he knew it was not white it was a grey world with room in it for all the people he felt so in that he almost blessed emma lazarus a group of them were laughingly trying to sing a foolish ditty with dirty words they were all so happy and drunk and there was a girl whose hands kept going to her temple and down behind her ears with long locks of hair which she pushed over her shoulder then she would toss her hair or attempt to but the long hair barely moved the long strands did not move freely they seemed waxen stuck around her face like fetters his hands went to his own head in sudden dirision and stuck in the dixie peach the girl swung her head again and caught his eyes he looked into her eyes as deeply as he could and his bitterness spilled like a white sizzle across to her in mockery and despair and a tender compassionate hatred the boy who had slapped him on the back moved toward the girl caught her by the hand and began to dance with her his hips swaying brutally ungraceful in mocknegro he went to the window dawn was moving up to the river and over the roofs it was time for him to go he knew that he would never go to another party with a negro no matter what color the negro wasthey were all embarrassing he might go if he were the only one only if he were jc he knew that his wife somehow resulted from this promise which he had made to himself a long time ago at the village party he had come a long way his name his picture his life were on the lips and the lifesized posters of the world subway bums whores and dogs could lean against his photograph in most of the worlds swinging cities and he was very wealthy he had his own entourage of jesters and the best hairdresser in the worldone who kept him well stocked with the best pomade the article in the magazine shouldnt have bothered him so much he told himself it wasnt the first time nor would it be the last he had to pay the price they were requiring it of him and he had to make it

larger than his parents living room had been mutely he dressed dejectedly he faced himself in the mirror silently the green gall of selfrevulsion passed through his psyche and soul swiftly he recalled the chance to make a million and the wife who would spend it on furs jewels fun cosmetics and servants and the whole world would see what black bastards with millions and melanin could do yes they would the agents smooth voice on the phone reassured him about the million there was nothing to reassure him about himself nothing nothing down the stairs voices were shrill suddenly his little girl

he knew she had read the article which had denied her existence a black female the race and sex which according to them could never move him to love to cherish to desire caldonia caldonia what makes your big head so hard he remembered his boyhood and all the lyrics which laughed at and lamented black womanhood blackness black manhood black childhood black they had made the world for him had set all the traps he had been born to it the horror of blackness they had outdone themselves they had outdone him and it was not meant that he should ever be saved he must believe and they could assume postures and lies and they could believe in his selfhatred and they could rest comfortably believing that he believed and continue their believing they were so arrogant so stupefied by history and circumstances that they could accept any incredible thing they said about him terror who was the bondsman who was the freed man he knew life began to flow again his blood sang vital and red freedom power even yes i am beautiful born black born with no lack decorated bom decorated at the foot of the stairs he could hear the maid again angrily muttering with dancers feet he moved nearer nearer to

folksll believe anything let em pay and pay white bastards what what the child questioned nothing go on to the playroom until i call you for lunch i got to vacuum up this room then he was there

for her vacuuminghere let me be of service he said never mind let me he said again and gently pushed her aside humph she said again but he got a glimpse of her face which had years of anger and defiance and hope written in chickenscratch wrinkles and crows feet and there was the mockery he always saw there and yet a kindness a laughter which was very sweet and strong and the barest hint of tears in the eyes tears like monuments to despair when he replaced the chairs and kissed his wife and child he said his goodbye to the black woman and sang a snatch of his latest recording as he walked to the elevator he felt lightweightless and yet strong and pretty i feel pretty he thought well not that kind of pretty he mocked himself but it was surprising that he sang for he had promised himself that he was only an entertainer that he wasnt your singing dancing spade that he a professional only wouldnt be caught dead drunk or straitlaced singing off the stage or away from the tv cameras or dancing like some hamhocking gigaboo nevertheless his chauffeur smiled happily when he cut a step from his latest musical sensation as he entered the limousine with the sacrilegious words i feel pretty floating cakewalking from his lips romanticists are wont to think that the pueblo de nuestra de senora de los angeles was settled by spanish grandees and caballeros sophisticated descendants of the conquisjfi tadores a close look at the record reveals however that the original founders or pobladores were a motley lot there was not a fullblooded white family among them but they were pioneer stock and with three exceptions they stayed and built the town we know today as los angeles when plans were completed for the envisioned pueblo fernando de rivera y moncada journeyed to mexico to recruit settlers for the town there after a whole year of persuading he succeeded in interesting only families or people and of that number only families or people actually made the trek majority were negroes the outfitting of the settlers took place at alamos a small town on the mexican mainland not far from the gulf of california seven of the families enlisted at rosario three at sinaloa and one at alamos the small group accompanied by an army contingent set out for their new home on feb though it is not widely known or emphasized the overwhelming majority of the founders of the pueblo de nuestra senora de los angeles were catholics of negro racial strain of those pobladores ultimately arriving at the projected site the only people of unmixed caucasian race in the whole community were two spanish men the settlers who represented a mixture of indian and negro with here and there a trace of spanish can be broken down into four racial strainsintermarriage among the latin american natives and europeans produced a multitude of castes children of an indian mother in an indiancaucasian union are considered mestizos whereas those of a negro mother in a negroindian union are classified as mulattos by this enumeration the founders of los angeles wereif these statistics prove nothing else at least they dispel any notion that there were any blueblooded spanish dons among the catholics who pioneered the city of the angels quite the contrary is the case for there were more negroes among the founders of los angeles than any other racial group and a realization of this factor useful for the social historian confirms that these noble pobladores sprang from hardy stock and the blood of true pioneers coursed through their veins ne of the virtues of margaret walkers long pages first novel jubilee houghton mifflin is its angle of vision the story of vyry the novels heroine is told from the negro viewpoint and since the period covered in the novel spans the years just prior to and just after the civil war this viewpoint alone is a novelty most of the vast catalogue of novels about that period of american history have treated black charactersif at allas animate furniture in the background of the swashbuckling lives of white men and women drawn twice their natural size it should be stated at the outset that jubilee does not turn the traditional civil war novel upsidedown or insideout in approach in insight and in its tone it clings to the familiar in fact jubilee flings aside one of the brighter robes of the traditional civil war novel it is almost totally lacking in romance but perhaps this fact was dictated by the novelists choice of heroine vyry miss walker informs us in a brief dedication in the book was actually margaret duggans ware brown the authors maternal greatgrandmother and it is possible that the sheer weight of the actual and of the need to keep within the bounds of careful research and credibility served to rob the narrative of romance in many ways vyrys story is the saga of the negros long hard bitter travail in this land she was born a slave and when mr lincolns eman cipation came she journeyed forth into a hostile world where those who had been her masters still ruled determined that emancipation notwithstanding black people would never stand equal beside them vyry is not of course the negro woman of her era to begin with she is the child of her master born to sis hetta the frail concubine of marse dutton at sis hetta died in childbirth having given marse dutton slaves for his fields and kitchens vyry grows up as a house nigger despised by her masters wife and ignored by her masterfather she is the particular servant of miss lillian who also is her sister the arrangement of course was far more common during those days than historians find it comfortable to admit love never comes to vyry sex does randall ware the coalblack free black man in dawson ga the town nearest the dutton plantations comes acourting and two children jim and minnaare born of that union ware though a prosperous blacksmith cannot purchase vyrys freedom and his one effort to lead her to freedom by way of the underground railroad is thwarted for her efforts vyry is beaten and lashed into unconsciousness but vyry is a true house nigger having assumed all the airs and prejudices of her calling and she has little taste for daring the war breaks out and ware goes north to offer his services to the invading yankee armies marse dutton dies and both the dutton son and soninlaw die in the fighting the ruin of the dutton family is complete when old missy dies and miss lillian following an assault by men in shermans army goes off her rocker faithful vyry stands by her demented mistress until relatives arrive from alabama to take the unfortu nate woman and her two children away then vyry marries innis brown a black man who turned up with shermans troops and stayed as her suitor after all randall ware has been away seven years and vyry has waited for him in vain now wed vyry and her family begin their trek across the rural south seeking a place to settle where the rampaging ku klux klan will let them live in peace all the forces of nature and bigotry contrive against them they are flooded out of one home exploited into poverty in another and burned out of a third finally in alabama vyry wins respect as a midwife and the whites permit her and her family to go their way then finally randall ware shows up again prosperous and forgiving providing for the education of his two children the book ends on this note it would be a pleasure to report that jubilee is the longawaited novel which tells the black mans story of that crucial period of conflict over slavery in this land but such unhappily is not the case miss walker has failed in her reach for the epic novel she has even failed to write a very interesting novel which is worse in the authors favor it might be said that she was overwhelmed by her material from a mass of information and history it was her task to weave a background for the story of vyry brown so much of that story is told in language that is surprisingly banal for a poet of miss walkers reputation and none of the sweep and turbulence of the civil war is captured or even suggested in her style the novel reads as though the author felt that her first duty was to provide the everyday details of vyrys life that in performing this duty the vast panorama of history would fall into place behind curious aspect of cp i q the struggle of black i people in america for a human rights is that generally we have assumed that economic exploitation and racism are one and the same thing they are not for instance the system of bondservitude which existed in america within the white race was a system of exploitation but not of racism and in europe animosity between the french and the germans could be termed racism but there is now no exploitation involved very often racism and exploitation are found in the same place at the same timeas in todays americabut a study of history will show that in most cases the exploitation of a race or nation began first and was then followed by a racist doctrine which rationalized that exploitation the spanish did not invade the south america of the nonwhite incas because they were racists but because they wanted the wealth of what was so pompously called the new world the slave traders of europe would not have bothered to invade africa in the name of racism alone the white world needed a source of cheap labor and raw materials in both cases and to varying degrees racism came later even so most of our leaders continue to treat the two facts of the life of black people in america as one and as a matter of fact attack racism more vehemently than they do economic exploitation what other reason exists why our leaders do not call for a nationwide boycott of all luxury products for black people to buy the necessities of life only from blackowned stores to boycott christmas itself in all but the spiritual and religious sense to boycott the automobile industry for a year or more or to form societies just as have the chinese to buy land and to open businesses it is because most of our leaders believe that if we can force the white man to give up his racism he will automatically cease to exploit us this is a ridiculous idea who is more exploited than a white mississippi who dies in vietnam defending an economic system that has given him nothing but a substandard education a sharecrop farm cheap clothes and too little to eat to the true exploiter of american society the big white man race means nothing he exploits his own as quickly and with no more conscience than he exploits black people but still our leaders accept the idea that racism and exploitation are the sameor worse that racism is the greater evil and to the extent that they accept this idea they have accepted the white mans definition of the black mans problem the big white man is no doubt very pleased about this he is very content to allow the black man to look after his eternal soul or to attack it just as long as the black man leaves his purse alone a perfect example of the confusion between racism and economic exploitation is our relationship with the white liberal especially in our condemnations of him i have read a good many of these by people of varying degrees of anger boiled down they state in effect that the white liberals liberalism is insincere that he helps us because he is inadequate in the white world and believing us to be inferior feels that he will be more than adequate in the black world or that he is a man who is racked by guilt over his racism and hopes not to face his true nature by throwing himself into the black mans struggle or finally that he is a big white man who has been exploiting black people as slum landlord or seller of inferior merchandise and gives his money for his consciences sake the last is one of the few valid condemnations but it should not be made our leaders should accept his money and use it to finance the black struggle but all the rest those in which not money but only the white liberals work in our behalf though actually on a superficial levelmiss the main point they assume that good white liberals do exist people who truly want to integrate black people into american society or who want to obliterate all consciousness of race in both the black and white man very seldom do these condemnations deal with the white liberals true feelings on exploitation the white liberal tells us that he is opposed to the exploitation of black people and we assume that he is opposed to all forms of exploitation in most cases he is not beware of the man who opposes only certain forms of exploitation as i have said the big white man does not care about the race of the people he exploits he is realistic is committed mainly to keeping things as they are change itself is his worst enemysince change means that he must make adjustments in his economic behavior that he must take risks notice for example how the stock market is effected by the change of presidents in the same way any change in the situation of black people either for better or worse would call for a corresponding change by the big white man to balance our attempts to bring about change the big white man uses americas white lowerclass some of them avowed racists who at worst call openly for our destruction and at least for a continuance of our present condition but at heart the lowerclass white has only so much power as the big white man gives him from time to time to retard our progress however committed to keeping things as they are the big white man does not allow the lowerclass white to go as far as he wants this may not always be so as more and more of the nonwhite world takes back the land and resources the big white man in europe and america has controlled for the last several hundred years and as automation diminishes the need for cheap labor the big white man will have to cut production the day is coming when he will no longer need black people to produce or to consume but for the time being we are safe he needs us all black man and lowerclass white most of our leaders believe that the lowerclass white is our worst enemy but at very least his racism does not involve any great exploitation of us and does not grow out of his whiteness as our angrier leaders believe but rather out of his competition with us within the american economy his fear is not that we will rape or worse marry his daughter but that we will take his job it is not even our concern tht he feels us to be ineror as a matter of fact it has worked to our advantage and will continue to do so a man who thinks his enemy is inferior is very likely to underestimate his enemys power and determination his supposed superiority will disarm him at this point we must see how the white liberal fits into this pattern he is not usually a white of the lowerclass but of the middleclass to some extent this explains why he does not ally himself with the lowerclass white within the white world he must stay on the good side of the big white man for he hopes one day to be one himself basically he joins us not because he is committed to equality but because the lowerclass white is the one who most threatens his middleclass position in white american society the fight against racism supplies an outlet for his liberalism necessary to his belief in the american system within which he or his father has achieved middleclass membership at the same time he protects himself against the rise of the lowerclass white at least one of his many beliefs which he must maintain to justify his wanting to join the big white man is that the big white man is ignorant of his exploitation of black people the big white man he tells us is sensitive intelligent moral and honest despite these qualities he does not know what he has done to black people in america for the last years as soon as he does know he will stop but a system of exploitation as refined and efficient as americas is certainly not the product of generations of ignorant men all the above would seem enough for us to handle for a long time if our leaders saw the situation as one of economic exploitation and formulated plans for us which would attack the weaknesses in the economic system but unfortunately they see the situation as one of racism and by assuming this our leaders accept the doctrine of white supremacy have i gone too far let us look for example at the black integrationist doesnt he instruct the black man to integrate himself economically socially and psychologically into american society in terms of economic integration just as he is now the black man is already integrated into the american economy which benefits from him as a consumer and when he can find a job as a worker even when he is not working he is used as a threat against the white worker thus within the economy the black man has a very definite function the black integrationist is not talking about true social integration either since he does not call for a total mixture of the races to create a new nonwhite race thus he is talking only about psychological integration but he is not calling upon the white man to become either totally or in part psychologically black he is calling upon the black man to become totally or partially white but as long as he is black the black man cannot become psychologically white his black skin gives him a set of experiences which will continue to make him black psychologically by calling upon the black man to integrate himself into american society the black integrationist can only mean that despite his black skin and his black experience the black man must become as white and as american as possible he is also asking the black man to ignore and renounce all that has and will happen to him until the day of total integration in order to do this the black man must ignore his total experience since with black skin he has had no white experience a man is his total experience to renounce it is to renounce himself totally why does the black integrationist call upon the black man to make this sacrifice so that he might be integrated totally into and be treated as a human member of american society the black integrationist then can only mean that to the extent that he is black the black man is not a human being and at most because of his black skin he can never be more than almost human if this is not white supremacy what indeed is white supremacy even most of our angrier leaders are white supremacists they begin from the premise that the white man is evil not because he exploits black people but because he is white they reason to be white is to be evil whiteness breeds racism which leads to exploitation therefore they ask us to separate ourselves from the evil of whiteness which will free us from the white mans exploitation this is a little better for it senses that the black man can best alleviate exploitation by remaining separated from american society but because their argument is directed against whiteness itself instead of exploitation it still leads to an acceptance of white supremacy for if the white man is evil because he is white his power over us must flow from his whiteness it follows he was able to dominate and exploit us because of the power of whiteness thus our very blackness is responsible for our condition it could not stand up to the evil power of whiteness if we separate from himthat is if we do not try to weaken the power of his whiteness with our blacknesshe will continue to be able to exploit us for the power of his whiteness is undiminished doesnt such an argument support the doctrine of white supremacy separation is indeed the answer not to flee the evil of whiteness but to create an economic unit which can bring an end to exploitation suppose for example the tenants of a slumbuilding in harlem formed a corporation to buy the building in which they lived then suppose more and more tenements were bought by the black people who lived in them until all of the buildings in harlem were owned by the people of harlem manhattan island is the most important island in the world harlem is almost half of manhattan island what if black people owned half of the most important island in the world and still most of our leaders and the majority of black people are committed to the integration movement and accept with that commitment the doctrine of white supremacy still the majority of black people trust the white liberal and even in their condemnations of him emphasize his whiteness or his hidden racism still the majority of black people accept the idea that even though some white liberals are insincere there do exist some good white liberals there is no such thing as a good white liberalnot because of the evil of whiteness but because of the evil of the concept of liberalism itself malcolm_x once said of all our studies history is best qualified to reward our research in order to understand the evil of liberalism we must find where it has appeared before and what were its end results we must find a people whose situation was similar to ours and see what happened to them at the hand of liberalism within the last years there has been such a people the jews of germany during the nazi era i realize that by introducing the inflammatory issue of the jewish people i risk being misunderstood very often our leaders are asked if black people are antisemitic they have a hard time answering because antisemitism is a racist concept fighting racism they hate to admit they themselves are racist but again the relationship of jews to black people is primarily not one of racism but of exploitation in america there is a pecking order of exploitation the big white man exploits both jew and middleclass white manindeed everybody the middleclass white man exploits the lowerclass white man in the black ghetto the jew tends to be the one who exploits the black man so in raising the question of the jew in germany it is important that we understand that the comparison is drawn in terms of exploitation not in terms of racism though racism as we will see certainly appears for centuries the jews of europe and particularly of germany had been victims of exploitation and racism even so they were allowed to function within the economy of europe the rothchilds come to mind but not until the nazi era did germany and europe adopt the policy of geno cide the extermination of the jewish race and it is an interesting and important historical fact that the nazism in germany grew not out of the monarchy of kaiser wilhelm but instead from the most liberal government germany ever had the german republic it took only years from the time of its formation in for hitler to rise through the legislative process to the chancellorship of the republic that this could happen within a liberal framework points to the evil of the liberal concept itself which is irrational despite all racial religious cultural and physical differences all men are the same for the german liberal this meant that even though the jew was a jew under his jewishness he was a german the german liberal was thus committed to the creation of a society in which the jews germanity could emerge but the jews jewishness was a fact not as is black skin besides most jews did not want to give up their jewishness beyond this the jews jewishness just as the black mans skin gave him a set of experiences which continued to make him jewish and to the same extent nongerman thus the jew by daring to want to remain a jew in fact by being jewish was the main obstacle to a liberal germany at this point the german liberal had to make a crucial decision he could either accept the jew as a jew not as a german with certain jewish characteristics and abandon his dream of a society where all men were completely german or he could continue to pursue his dream but a close look at the german liberal reveals that he was not committed to integrating jews into german society as much as he was committed to the ideal of uniformity such dreams die hard the german liberal frustrated in his attempts to germanize the jew saw the salvation of his dream of uniformity in hitlers call for the extermination of the jews only when there were no more jews would everybody be truly german the german liberal cast his lot with hitler all situations have an economic base in this case the real exploiters of germany were pleased by this development their power was being threatened by the lowerclass german who was calling for an end to his exploitation and was joining the communists in great numbers in germany the liberal helped to redirect the mind of the lowerclass german away from his own exploitation the jew became a scapegoat for the misery of the lowerclass german i need only add that the german republic was formed after germany had lost world war one which brought on the collapse of the german economy i trust i do not have to draw out the comparison to great lengths clearly the white liberal committed to the dream of american uniformity does not accept the black man as he is we cannot risk discovering what he will do when he finds out that his dream cannot be made a reality as long as black people exist in america one more thing at this time america is fighting a war which it cannot seem to win decisively and which if lost will bring about drastic changes with which the big white man will have to deal earlier i quoted malcolm_x on the value of studying history i did not give the quotation fully in the next breath he continued and when you see that youve got a problem all you have to do is examine the historic method used all over the world by others who have problems similar to yours i think malcolm_x would have also taught us that even before we can discover what other people did about their problems we must first be certain we know the true nature of our own problem and that while we look for the solution we should be careful to avoid the mistakes made by people who faced similar problems especially at the end of his life malcolm_x knew all of this i think that is why returning from mecca he told us that he no longer believed our problem to be solely one of race but of human rights and of exploitation it would be a great shame now that he is dead if we moved backwards from the point to which at times very much against our will he had pushed us in february the southern college students took matters i q into their own hands changing the nature of civil_rights strategy since then the civil_rights question has been a g major domestic concern in the united states and headline news throughout the world sympathizers with the civil_rights movement have generally been impressed by the concept of a moral cause which has given rise to a modern great crusade theirs has been the sublime conviction of eventual victory so much so that they have paid little attention to the course and direction of the everyday struggle examination of the current situation however reveals that despite the marches large and small despite the sitins wadeins and other nonviolent protest demonstrations despite the considerable toll of human sacrificethe civil_rights revolt is in mortal danger in fact the civil_rights revolt is well on its way to defeat through the first two phases of the revolt february to the march on washington august and the second phase the counterrevolution august to the present the civil righters have been severely crippled by three primary weaknesses which have contributed to their present difficulty i the civil righters have never known the nature of the problem nor the nature of the enemy ii the civil righters have lacked the necessary institutions and apparatus to achieve their objective iii the civil righters have not projected a clear view either of the society as it is or the society as it ought to be any single one of these weaknesses would be enough to frustrate any reform attempt with these three basic weaknesses the civil_rights reform movement is doomed to isolation frustration and annihilation the moderate civil righters will settle for tokens as they always have the conservative civil righters will have to be happy with status without substance while the tactics of the civil righters have been dramatic their tactics have essentially depended on the open bestiality and blind stupidity of sheriffs state troopers and elected officials to this date the civil righters have not developed and in some instances have not wished to develop a stable disciplined massbased power organization determined to deal with the problems of the black people of this land the past two years have merely borne out the accuracy of joseph p lyfords observation that the term revolution or revolt when applied to the current efforts of the negro middleclass to secure rights and privileges commensurate with their class status has been a serious misnomer without doubt the negro middleclass has dominated much of the current effort and has disguised its class goals to give the appearance that its efforts were racial in nature rather than class oriented at best these valiant efforts are a conservative reform movement a reform whose goals are pictured in terms of the verbalized but not the actual creed of the society in attempting such a class reform under the guise of racial reform the leaders and followers of this movement have indicated that they understand neither the racial problem nor the nature of the society for the past years scholars have been suggesting that the race problem in america is a special type of the ageold colonial problem and as such is a racial problem that is a problem at the root of the society the problem is a hybrid outgrowth of both the basic european bourgeois racist attitude of contempt and the societys own organizational and industrial structure in contrast to this view the negro bourgeoisie conservative by training and conditioning has insisted through most of its recent history that the racial problems of the united states are purely a domestic issue this class has looked for the explanation of the behaviour and motivation of the dominant white society in every directionsave economic and cultural premises assumptions of europe and europeans the struggle of this class against racist exploitation has now developed into a fight against individual bigotry and intolerance blinded by this basic fallacy and misled in their beliefs that there was a possibility of even political equality under the present system the negro middleclass has tried to peddle the idea that the white middleclass was in favor of rights for negroes this lack of a realistic modern orientation has brought profoundly limiting consequences the reformers insist on the passage of legalistic but generally unenforceable regulations they are overly concerned with the maintenance of a good image rather than the attainment of solid objectives and are forever calling upon the federal government to intervene on behalf of black citizens in trouble civil righters particularly the more conservative ones continually issue solemn declarations of domesticity to reassure the society according to these declarations negroes will maintain their nonviolent posture and not look anywhere in the world for insight information and support recently roy wilkins executive secretary of the naacp issued such a statement when he said that the naacp was opposed to the peace demonstration to be held august mr wilkins stated that naacp was opposed because the official word is that there will be a civil disobedience attempt to crash into the white house and another attempt to occupy the chamber and desks of the house of representatives he and his organization would not be party to such a thing in effect the older line groups have been thwarting the development of the civil_rights cause by keeping the struggle isolated to one single issue the younger more radical civil righters as well have been affected by this kind of thinking or nonthinking many of these young people want a quick decision since their cause is right and they have exposed the cancerous nature of societys inner life b the people the leadership and followers of the civil_rights cause generally do not understand the mass of white society since the civil righters and the negro middleclass interpret their efforts as a holy crusade they were unprepared for the response that has developed since the march on washington in blinded by a deep liberal and religious tradition few have acknowledged that since october the path of the civil righters has been blocked by a veritable wall of white emotion lou harris reported that the negro ibm tabulators were unprepared surprised frightened and overwhelmed by the race hatred expressed in the responses of a representative cross section of the white population the responses were so shocking that these negro ibm tabulators threatened to resign in the midst of the mammoth task at this writing the feelings of white society have not changed appreciably in some instances the conflict has exacerbated and intensified negative feelings of whites and group activity and corporate action has replaced individual white hostility and prejudice white friends and allies of the negro struggle whether liberal or radical have unwittingly contributed to the lack of understanding of the true nature of the feelings of the overwhelming number of whites the whites who for whatever reason have sided with the negro represent a valiant but small percentage of the white group and their voices have been drowned out by the booming shouts of anger and hatred by the vast majority not only did the civil righters fail to understand the white community but they also demonstrated an appalling ignorance of the black communityits wants needs goals and aspirations the civil righters have constantly dealt in abstract ideals in religious and moral slogans without ever getting down to bread and butter issues harris and other pollsters repeatedly realize that a broad section of the negro lower class either were lying in their answers or were not even included in the tabulations the negro middleclass in the polls revealed an inexhaustible craving for acceptance and love the civil righters have attempted to convert the bulk of the population to a new set of values this attempt at conversion speaks a deeply religious motivation further it ignores the deep suffering within the black community it is misguided since this society is both driven and secular while the civil righters may continue to sing their myth of hope we shall overcome the truth is that their assessment of the attitudes of the bulk of the population was a gross miscalculation of the true feelings of the american people about basic political realities for since the birth of this nation the concept of democracy to most people has meantfor whites only in short the civil righters and their sympathizers have never known the problem or the nature of the problem they are trying to solve or the people that they are trying to convert by and large the civil righters have never questioned the values of a society which could first enslave the negro turn him loose without freeing him keep him in his place by racism and then threaten to do away with that very place by automation and technological change to call this limited reform movement a revolt or revolution is patently absurd above all else this reform essentially lacks a relevant point of view h no institutions no apparatus men pursue their goals through institutions whatever gains the civil_rights reform movement has made have been the product of maximum human spontaneity and very limited institutional apparatus since the civil_rights movement has only produced two organizations of a national character the student nonviolent coordinating committee and the northern student movement some of the civil_rights activists have shown a disenchantment and marked hostility for all structures and formal organizations preferring to substitute personal zeal and commitment for planning and group execution at times much of this type of spontaneity has almost resembled anarchy a number of strong local adhoc groups have grown and been supported but by and large the revolution has not developed any distinguished regional or national revolutionary apparatus a number of new local leaders have gained experience and prominence in leading the demonstrations yet there is still a lack of administrative skills necessary to sustain ongoing projects and programs the leaders of this society have wisely not seen fit to recognize or deal with the new activist groups instead the leaders of this society have continued to deal with the oldline civil_rights organizations whom themselves are instruments of whitepower interests this willingness on the part of the local power structures to negotiate with the oldline groups has necessarily strengthened the hand of the traditional groups like the naacp and the urban league in strengthening the position of the oldline black establishment the leaders of the society have with little effort slowed the thrust of the civil_rights forces in exchange for the recognition and money tokens of the white society the traditional negro groups and many of the moralists have been willing to continue the fiction of a moral issue and decry the use of all radical approaches to solve the racial problem a radical problem the moralists have counselled peace moderation and progress the exchange has been profitable for both partiesthe leaders of the society and the negro traditional groups fair exchange is certainly no robbery one incident of this nature occurred in the community of rochester new york the ministers of that community had brought in saul alinsky community organizer extraordinary to organize the negro community in a peaceful direction to avoid a repetition of the riots the local businessmen countered by raising to start an urban league chapter in that city the urban league is constantly praised as the ideal responsible organization no one says for whom this organization is ideal or to whom it is responsible the national urban league has become the middleclass link between the negro revolution and the white power structure and there is widespread evidence to support this claim the league function has been that of a successful mediator for which it receives the social welfare tokens of white american philanthropy in the name of racial progress on the other hand the naacp has been very ready to denounce all procedures as racial postures or radical maneuvers the city fathers of rochester were reportedly most happy to seize upon the statement of roy wilkins executive secretary of national headquarters naacp that rochester had made great strides in correcting its discriminatory practices mr wilkins in particular has been unusually responsible to the best interests of the entire american community the white power interests so zealous were his efforts that the liberator magazine interpreted his posture as indicative of racial selfhate which aided and abetted this oppressive society although the white society looks continually to the naacp and the urban league it has remained apparent for some years that neither group speaks for the rank and file of negro americans the very style of the negro establishment the unofficial name for the traditional groups exerts a tremendous pressure towards conformity and uniformity and therefore active conservatism the pronouncement of these groups have been militant but their behaviour has been conservative the battle cry of the establishment throughout the revolt is a confession of its ideological bankruptcy and programatic poverty deal with us or the radicals will take over deal with us or there will be a long hot summer these are two often heard themes not only is the style of the civil_rights groups conservative but the groups themselves are often not related to the masses it was not until the summer of that martin_luther_kings southern christian leadership conference group began work on the grassroot level sclc attempted to organize the rural inhabitants of a county in alabama and dr_king the organizations charismatic leader made a number of forays into northern urban ghettos the student nonviolent coordinating committee fortunately has had a long history of working with the people on the grassroots level other adhoc local groups have attempted to unionize the workers even the domestics and the sharecroppers the dominant oppresive society has responded with hostility to such efforts the traditional civil_rights groups are often only passingly familiar with the hopes desires and aspirations of the black people this lack of familiarity with the problems of the masses plus the apparent lack of relevant ideas gives rise to repeated cries that the negro leadership should be democratized the institutions which these undemocratized leaders head are similarly unresponsive and unimaginative the performance of the negro institutions has all but left the negro revolt without adequate institutional channels through which it can confront the dominant oppressive society without adequate channels and with slumbering and fumbling leadership of the existing apparatus negro revolt or discontent has no avenue through which it might work this lack of a workable avenue gives rise to the frequently heard question is protest to become an end in itself no clear dream or goal we shall overcome and freedom now are important slogans of the present racial efforts as inspiring and emotionally buying as these chants may be these selfsame slogans hardly hide the fact that the negro revolt as it is termed has not projected a vision of what the society is or what the society ought to be only the muslims and the nationalists to their credit have projected a dream of a better community their dream is an allblack or in some sophisticated circles a multiracial society with the borrowed concept of a profound redistribution of resources economic and political power and a rejection of the present white mass middleclass cultures corruption and hypocrisy even the view of some of the muslims or nationalists sometimes sounds more like a wish to replace white capitalism by a form of black capitalism a replacement of the uncolored decadence by a colored variety of that same poisonous social decadence the civil righters cold hard realists that they are have no dream they use a slogan instead for a dream they substitute a hodgepodge of emotional slogans and individual demands and issue disoriented protests slogans like we shall overcome and freedom now as used by the traditional civil_rights moralists hardly disguise the fact that the plans and goals projected by the civil_rights leadership are essentially colorless dreams and fantasies unrelated to the situation of the rank and file of negroes today instead the dreams are related to white middleclass liberal aspirations even the widely heralded i have a dream speech of dr martin_luther_king jr projected a goal for the american society as a whole while verbalizing the negro middleclass fantasies of integration and eventual assimilation lou harris polls of july and february revealed that to the rank and file negro the goals of the revolt were private individual hopes each hope represented the personal price for which the individual might be willing to settle when closely examined the sellout prices revolved about the consumeroriented status tokens of white middleclass society try as they might the civil_rights leaders because they didnt know where they were why they were there in the first place or where they were going wouldnt or better yet couldnt present a plan for negroes of various classes and stations the civil righters were indeed happy even grateful that the poverty program was proposed to handle some of the pressing problems of the lowerclass negro and some of the mobility problems of the negro middleclass even the staunchest civil righters cannot suggest that the poverty program is a serious answer to inequality yet by default this poverty war is their only real proposal the ability of a people to dream for that in reality is what a utopia is about is a sign of hope and an affirmation of life for a group to lack this power to dream or to be unable to construct a utopian model is an admission of a deep sense of powerlessness on the part of that group no utopias have been projected by the civil righters the fact that the entire negro freedom movement has failed to project a goal is another index of the powerlessness of the movement itself save for those small groups who have begun the long tortuous road to community organization and community development the negro freedom movement without model or goal is marching ever marching without knowing from whence it came or where it goes with such unchartered course however all movement can be considered progress all change seems to be beneficial all activity no matter how poorly conceived becomes desirable activity is essential because it obscures the vacuum which exists in the thinking and planning of the civil righters themselves the movement of the past six years therefore has been a generally unsuccessful attempt to substitute motion for thought it has been an attempt to make an unwilling society live up to its verbalizations of brotherhood of man freedom and democracy the revolutionaries have not questioned the values of the society merely some of its practices it is safe to conclude that from its beginning the negro reform movement without relevant point of view nor adequate institutions nor a goal has been doomed to real but not apparent failure revolutions begin in the minds of men a slave is one who will not do his own thinking the negro reform movement is a product of the hearts and feet of men the reform movement has not captured the minds of men primarily because it has not aimed at their minds instead the reform has been directed towards mens hearts the reform movement has assumed that it is possible to find freedom and equality under the current economic and social system integrate ones way out of a system of inequality involve the federal government meaningfully in the protection of the constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizenship the reformers have placed great faith in ageless promises of democracy human dignity and the value of personality furthermore the civil righters have felt that this society meant to provide a piece of the action to the blacks negroes have never understood that they themselves were the action the main target in a classic game of exploitation after five years some persons have slowly begun to recognize that legal citizenship guarantees do not apply to the rank and file negroes and that those citizenship guarantees that the middleclass negro groups have apparently secured are never assured there is a need therefore not for a mere change of tactics but for a reexamination of the struggle its direction its premises and assumptions such a reassessment must occur before the voterregistrationlaw euphoria has fully set in for while many hail the passage of the voterrights bill few have seriously questioned the primary assumption of that legislation viz that once the right to vote is secured the negro will stand on the threshold of winning his other rights the truth is that after six years of effort although the negros position has improved politically somewhat in every other sphere his life situation has become even more precarious than it was in employment exploitation has given way to automated uselessness his housing condition deteriorates steadily and housing segregation is steadily increasing the negro family trembles and rocks under successive economic shock waves migration from the farm overcrowds the already bursting ghettos and their facilities middleclass negroes and white liberals in their zest to reform have talked of significant progress changing the negros image and trying to meet the need of the present with programs out of the past designed to help persons in the distant future instead of paying attention to the work of the social and political scientists the negro has just ignored the facts and continued waging his moral crusade in placing trust in the moralist the middleclass negro with his allies has revealed that the negro does not wish to be a free man for six years the negro and his allies have been dreaming screaming shouting marching sittingin wadingin lyingin to be a part of a white racist society which has decreed that it will not treat him either as a free man or as an equal human being still the negro has pursued this goal with determination zeal and tenacity the past years have therefore been merely a prelude to a creative and forceful action to defeat racism a prelude of unrequited love unrewarded suffering and unbelievable naivete a prelude to meaningful preception conception and action which must procede any major social change if this period has been a prelude then impatient negroes must learn to accept the fact that some men learn very slowly indeed if on the other hand the civil_rights forces and their leaders continue along the same path then what is prelude for the negro people marks the finale for the current negro leaders i learned a new word the other day jj underclass evidently a it means poor folks ccznc thirty years ago most of us were called working class we didnt mind that and a few of us even liked it working class had a sturdy independent sound then it became a dirty word the people with jobs who made enough money graduated to the middleclass and now we leftovers are the underclass and nobody is supposed to like that we dont have enough money we are told because we lack motivation education skills influence and some of us are the wrong color our wellintentioned friends who discovered us want to help us get out of this underclass as fast as we can to give us a handup into their middleclass at the risk of seeming ungrateful to these good white liberals lets stop a bit to look around before we start to scramble out it may look different to us down here than it does to the white liberal in his neat mortgaged little house in the suburbs first who are we i am an underclass white woman who refuses to identify with or aspire to middleclass values and i presume to speak for that minority with underclass values as well as pocketbooks most of the black people in the ghetto are defined by their incomes as near or among the underclass and their separate subculture is recognized being white i know that i cannot speak for the black underclass but perhaps i am permitted to speak about my harlem neighbors perhaps white as i am i may look with them from out of the ghetto at what our betters expect us to scramble for and imitate for to me the black ghetto is the last great reservoir of dignity and courage and humanity and to it i have turned for refuge now let us look up into the suburb down here we can afford the time to live when we are through work we can laugh and play and be kind really completely and i dont think you in the suburbs can ever relax enough to do that once you start scrambling with everyone else there in the suburb for a bigger salary a bigger house and a bigger mortgage the scrambling must take every bit of you every minute of your lives we can stand up to the boss instead of cringing before him we can be decent and fair to our fellow humans instead of trying to climb on their backs or slit their throats we can have friends because they are friends and not just the right people to cultivate we can be and do what we want because we are not living to impress our neighbors all this of course is mixed up with a lot of frustration and misery and wed like to sort it out please sometimes you even say your suburb is a great kind of nonliving it seems so to a few of us we like your suburb but not the way you live in it about ten years ago i had two underclass sons in high school in a suburban and farming community the school undertook to roll them out and stamp out two middleclass boys just like the millions of gingerbread boys that are coming off our high school assembly lines every year it failed and at times the boys resistance to the rolling and stamping process became conscious rebellion the school administration was piqued because they didnt turn out for athletics it wasnt patriotic the boys were too busy raising cattle running our farm working parttime and participating in activities of their own choice to oblige the administration they wore jeans to school by preference and necessity they enjoyed some of the subjects but they came to despise the conformity and hypocrisy that undergirded the school they learned many things not in the curriculum for my younger son the first lesson came shortly after he entered school a larger older boy a prominent athlete began picking on him it seemed to be working up to a fight one day passing each other in the hall the athlete made an obscene gesture to my son he replied with bastard the athlete cursed him back and my son punched him they were exchanging blows when the viceprincipal came along stopped the fight and demanded an explanation my son told the truth expecting equal punishment the athlete denied making the dirty gesture and blamed my son for starting the fight the viceprincipal believed him my son concluded since the man couldnt be that stupid that the official favored the big boy because he was a prominent athlete my older son had a stimulating civics course in which the students examined various forms of government including communism during the mccarthy hysteria the teacher was run out of the school by local american legion pressure he took a position at a junior college the boys brother taking the course two years later found a timorous little man teaching platitudes and avoiding the study of controversial material the boy spent the semester needling the teacher was he afraid to think about anything that happened after the nineteenth century one night the boys came home excited and angry they had been with a group of students at a drivein that evening when the police came looking for a gang that wasnt there the police told the students to clear out two other underclass brothers were slow to move along a cop came up from behind and banged their heads together not realizing who it was one of the brothers whirled quickly and swung at the cop the cop began clubbing him and his brother jumped the cop both boys were arrested one was a student the other out of school with a police record the policeman had a reputation for brutality with teenagers i shared my sons indignation and agreed with their determination to stand by the arrested boys the school administration cooperated with the police in preparing a case against the boys it called in prominent students and rehearsed with them a story of sinister gangs in the school the throng that congregated casually on the steps there were no organized gangs my older son testified for the defendants we reached a concensus its rotten but stay in school and out of trouble one beautiful spring day a spontaneous mass vacation from school occurred that included not only the usual truants but prominent students from good families my younger son then in his last year joined the exodus the next day the students returned to school with their excuses evidently it had really been an unaccountable epidemic of illness my son reported to the office to get back into school wheres your excuse i havent any he replied the administrator admitted him for the day only the next morning the boy was again in the office wheres your excuse i havent any i tell you and i wont have any my mother wont lie for me the boy was severely punished with endless hours to make up after school the other students excuses were blandly accepted we learned of this incident from a teacher after both my sons were through school one afternoon a janitor was driving away from the school when missiles began thumping the top of his car looking up he saw two boys tossing empty beer cans from an upperfloor window he returned to investigate found the boys drunk in an empty classroom and notified the school authorities the boys were not punished the entire affair was hushed up and the janitor was warned not to make something out of it at peril to his job one of the boys was the son of a local banker and school board member among the teachers my sons had a few good friends who liked and understood them underclassness and all encouraged by his english and drama teachers my younger son decided to apply for admission to the state university which his older brother was by that time atnding he went to the office for the proper form the guidance officer refused him the form urging instead that he enroll at a junior college for vocational training in mechanicsobviously more appropriate for an underclass youngster in jeans the boy was not interested and was indignant i wrote an acid note to the counselor indicating my contempt for his values the boys english teacher persuaded him not to deliver the note but she encouraged him to insist on the admission blank he finally got it shortly after this the boy and the english teacher were discussing the recipient of the best local scholarship to the university hell never make it the boy predicted hes an applepolisher who knows how to make himself look good and thats why the faculty chose him but hes dumb the scholarship winner flunked out the first year so my sons managed to get through high school without the rolling and stamping two oddlooking figures among the gingerbread boys that came off the assembly line the most important lessons of those years were not accredited that in the middleclass world one need pay only lip service to truth honor and goodness that the search for knowledge is better confined safely to noncontroversial subjects that the price of middleclass success would be their nonconformity that integrity and selfrespect are expensive commodities to be jettisoned in the scramble that the smooth plausible surface is infinitely more important than the right or wrong underneath whatever of morality they learned was outside ofand in spite ofthe school these were white boys therefore they were taught had they been black boys in a ghetto school they would not have been taught and there would have been little pressure to conform to middleclass values black youngsters didnt need to know about being middle class for they didnt belong there anyway now our wellintentioned white friends who want to haul us up out of the underclass propose to break up the ghetto schools and teach the black boys give them as good an education as all those little gingerbread boys rolling out of our high schools every spring have received it is assumed the black boys will be grateful this is why their parents have been demonstrating and boycotting segregated schools most white educators recognize a subculture exists in the negro community their conception of it varies to some the underclass ghetto is filled with irresponsible primitives given to music dancing sex and cutting their neighbors a few concede the loyalty and lack of competitiveness of the ghetto are virtues but i doubt if any of them have gone grocery shopping on a saturday afternoon in a certain small supermarket in harlem it is negromanaged and almost entirely negrostaffed i preferred it to the larger lowerpriced white supermarkets in the area because the customers were treated like neighbors instead of colonials the aisles are narrow the store crowded the carts begin to look like a downtown traffic jam half a dozen customers are lined up waiting to have vegetables weighed but for all the confusion and delay he people are gracious and goodhumored the inevitable small collisions become matters for genuine concern and apology the woman at my check stand has a real smile and the box boy a high school student is full of friendly small talk i contrast this to the cool perfunctory politeness of the suburban supermarket where the checker and box boy manage to combine a dale carnegie obsequiousness with contempt and the customers barely mask their irritation at the slightest inconvenience i cannot know the pain and tensions that lie beneath the dignity and warmth of my harlem neighbors but i find the behavior of these underclass black people in the supermarket vastly pleasanter and more civilized than that of their white superiors in the suburbs nowwhat have these white educators who know nothing of my supermarket in harlem to give the underclass black boy depending on their competence they can give him knowledge and skills regardless of their competence they will probably try to give him their middleclass value system many negro boys will undoubtedly accept all this and darkercolored gingerbread boys will begin rolling out of the high schools indistinguishable from the lighter ones but the best of the underclass black boys may resist they will retreat into the proud hostility with which my boys fought the schools pattern of middleclass conformity they will be termed incorrigible unmotivated and ungrateful they would like the knowledge and skills but not at the price of their own integrity their parents will watch with loving concern as i did cherishing their sons strength fearful that the boys alienation mav drive them to consider them selvesand to be considered cutaws it is wildly funny even to think of expecting the educators to move bto the ghetto so that they could measure some of their statistics and stereotypes against reality their superiority and condescension ae so deep that it is inconceivable to them that they could learn from the underclass but mavbe we can reach a truce with them let them stop talking about the culturallydeprived child because the term may mean anything or nothing to them it means a black child in the ghetto to me it means a white child in the suburbs lets agree that underclass children need to be taught reading mathematics science fine arts and social studies devoid of middleclass propaganda they do recognize that we are the underclass separate from their middleclass let the schools confine themselves to knowledge and leave out the compulsory value system although the educators apparently worship money and success let them quit patronizing us because we are poor and undistinguished if their middleclass culture looks good to us well try to adopt it quickly enough if not thats our business possibly the high school assembly line could then convert from gingerbread boys to human beings at the recent writers conference at fisk university ossie davis had some striking things to say about the importance of images said mr davis images must correspond to some accepted reality upon which people communicate and are agreed probing further he asked do you know that because of the connotation the word black has in our culture when you look at your child and call him black you have already insulted him in sixty different ways certainly one of those ways is implied when one looks in an anthology even the most recent ones to find such a neglect of negro writers that it is appalling there seems to be one reason for this neglect the image of the negro as a serious writer is extremely difficult if not downright minacious certainly three centuries has produced writers whose works are worthy of recognition the neglect is calculated the negros image as a writer suffers of course a solitary few make the grade yet in no area is pure tokenism so evident another way in which the negro is insulted is that too often before he opens his mouth even in the presence ofperhaps especially in the presence ofthe white who knows him only across the discussion table he is labeled if his language is the cultured speech of his training it is passed off as imitative if it is characterized by the dialect of an uneducated environment though no less different in the main from the speech of immigrants it is regarded as repulsive quaintness is the reason for other linguistic aberrations in america explanation for poor speech among negroes is connected with physical type no one would attempt to explain the phraseology throw mama from the train a kiss in terms of size of mouth shape of nose or mental type yet many writers of the early twentieth century sought to do this with negroes according to dr raven mcdavid and his wife jerome dowd j a tillinghast and even early howard odum have deliberately publicized arguments for the allegedly childlike mentality of the nesro as reasons for dialectal variations or imagine the temerity of albert wiggam who claimed in his popular column lets explore your mind that the negro cannot pronounce words such as car beard and bird because his lips are too thick thick lips and blackness have long been a part of this combination of insults which every negro has felt regardless of the varying hues of his skin as recently as spring explaining a fundsponsored project in updating negro speech the newscaster referred to the average speech of the negro as repulsive and unintelligible this somewhat blanket statement is hardly fair in isolation for it could easily be said of any group or any situation where there are expected departures from common language patternsfamily relationships daily chores work play cookery and even intimacies language has three basic forms if one is to try to assess its variations scientifically lexical phonetic and morphological lexically the negro has participated fully in adding to and perpetuating the word stock of his country this participation and contribution goes far back into the history in america proof of this is to be found all the way from his earthy southern speech to the louisiana patois to the gullah of south carolina and georgia to the bahamian traces in key west and miamito the classic epithets i remember from a dear lady nearly years old who though nearly illiterate in the specific sense was verbose in the use of such alliterative phrases as sitting there like a nut on a tusset said in sibilant disgust phonetically and morphologically perhaps because of the negros isolation from american cultural life for so long the negros speech variations are most apparent and to some obnoxious close examination will show that dialect forms are in many instances similar to th century english english teachers of the race no doubt overzealously have demanded strict adherence to the rule often forgetting the students and even their own erstwhile background certain pronunciations do seem troublesome picture vs pitcher diploma postponed mischievous to mention only a few yet listening in on rural radio or television stations one realizes that mispronunciations are not racially inspired nonconformity to morphological forms is apparent in numerous verbs principal parts of drink become begin do etc conjugation of the verb to be in the present and past tenses for example yet one immediately recalls that lil abner is not based on negro cultural life education is gradually wiping out grammatical variations and it seems to me that the time has come for the triplelinguistic revolution of appreciating the contributions lexically and literally that negroes have made to american culture allowing the negro a chance to see himself in perspective as he moves into a new era and allowing the negro at this historical juncture to begin to look back with natural pride not shame upon the folkways and folk language of his own group the great societys t war on poverty has one feature that cannot be overemphasized among the youth of the underprivileged and that is the various programs intended to introduce culturally deprived youth to books and libraries the project head start for preschoolers with its story hours and availability of many wellwritten and excellently illustrated childrens books and the wellstocked libraries for the young people in the job corps are not luxuries by any means but rather they are important ingredients for successful programs the mixture of the right books and poverty historically have stimulated some very interesting creative results among men excellent examples would be the cases of james baldwin ralph ellison and richard wright all three having several facts about their lives in common first they are americans from similar economic and cultural backgrounds second they are negroes and third somewhere in their writings they have revealed that books andor librarians have played important roles in their lives as creative writers it was as a youngster that baldwin discovered the librarya harlem branch of the new york public library he attended the childrens story hours in the afternoons and on saturday mornings where he listened to the stories told by the childrens librarian as a teenager he was a ferocious reader he read and reread uncle toms cabin and the tale of two cities and held as his favorite authors henry james ernest hemingway john steinbeck nathaniel hawthorne and many others he discovered in his community and school libraries by the time baldwin was he was a preacher at the storefront fireside pentecostal church in harlem the school librarian and some of his teachers remember him as a small bright sadlooking boy he was editor of the high school literary magazine and spent much of his free time reading and writing instead of playing stick ball on the streets of harlem after three hysteriatinged years as a preacher he discovered that he would rather be a writer than a boy preacher his big break came in when he was awarded a eugene saxton fellowship which permitted him to devote full time to his literary work following his first professional publication which was a book review in the nation magazine it was not long before articles and stories appeared in partisan review american mercury commentary reporter and harpers magazines like many of the earlier american writers who as young artists found themselves disenchanted with home and became exiled baldwin moved to paris in it was while in paris that he was able to develop in a more congenial atmosphere he stated that he wanted to go to paris so that he would not become merely a negro writer but after a few years he found that paris was not completely the haven he had expected at least he was able to publish his first book a novel with a significant enough title go tell it on the mountain following this first published work came several other works of fiction and essays there is no doubt that james baldwin is a significant contributor to american letters librarians like to think about baldwins introduction to the harlem branch of the new york public library as the beginning of his becoming a writer an author dedicates his book to an individual or individuals who have been an inspiration to him or contributed in some great way to the writing of his book in ralph ellisons latest book shadow and act published in his dedication reads for morteza sprague a dedicated dreamer in a land most strange it is significant to note that the dreamer the late morteza sprague was librarian at tuskegee institute for years or more sprague still remembers vividly the first time he encountered ralph ellison as a freshman taking an introductory literature course as a youngster ellison discovered t s eliots wasteland and because of his interest in poetry he attempted to follow up all the footnotes reading all those books perhaps it was in the library at tuskegee that he discovered the negro poet countee cullen and his powerful poem heritage a poem that was to make a profound change in ellisons attitude towards the negro who knows maybe it was cullens poem that helped him to answer the question what am i some years later with the following remark i answer that i am a negro american that means far more than something racial it does not mean race it means something cultural that i am a man who shares a dual heritage books librarians and poverty i am sure proved to be interesting chemistry in the life of the creative genius ralph ellison in the case of richard wright peasant life on a mississippi plantation was never forgotten as a youngster wright lived in natchez jackson greenwood and carters in mississippi elaine helena and west helena in arkansas and memphis tenn as we can see his childhood consisted of moving from one southern town to the next or parttime jobs and sporadic schooling at he ran away from home and took a job in memphis it was there that he had his first public library experience in his essay the ethics of jim crow published in he describes how he devised a way to borrow books from the public library it was almost impossible to get a book to read it was assumed that after a negro had imbibed what scanty schooling the state furnished he had no further need for books i was always borrowing books from white men on the job one day i mustered enough courage to ask one of the men to let me get books from the library in his name surprisingly he consented armed with a library card i obtained books in the following manner i would write a note addressed to the librarian and sign the name of the white supervisor i would stand at the desk hat in hand looking as unbookish as possible when i received the books i would take them home if the books listed in the note happened to be out i would sneak into the lobby and forge a new one in this manner wright developed even deeper his passion for reading cutting his teeth on such authors as theodore dreiser h l mencken sinclair lewis and sherwood anderson his first published pieces were poems articles and stories the federal writers project hired him and published one of his stories in the anthology american stuff his first book uncle toms children was followed by native son twelve million black voices black boy the outsider and several other works of lesser stature james baldwin ralph ellison and the late richard wright did not have the head start classes of today where hundreds of children are being introduced to not only books but painting music and all of the other wonderful things children need in todays world to make their lives more meaningful and complete we know that it was only through chance that these men discovered books but let us not leave to chance for future baldwins ellisons and wrights because we know now that books and poverty do mix in all the tumult and shouting over established racial discrimination in the various areas of community life in chicago the national spotlight has declined to linger on one of the most positive and concrete accomplishments to emerge from the freedom movements struggle it is just as well operation breadbasket proceeds most effectively in the quiet semianonymity of the phone call and the conference and it has been effective in early september after less than six months of pressure and negotiation operation breadbasket had secured for chicago negroes some jobs representing a staggering total in annual income of approximately operation breadbasket in chicago is organized along the same lines as its successful predecessors in other cities notably philadelphia ministers of both races and of many religious faiths and denominations band together to seek jobs for negroes in those industries which do considerable business in the negro community but which nevertheless hire few if any negroes a committee of these ministers approach the management of these businesses suggest that they add a previously determined number of negro employees and offer their services in steering qualified personnel toward the industry in the beginning many of the businesses balked when that happened the ministers returned to their pulpits advised their parishioners to boycott the products of the reluctant businesses and waited it was never necessary to wait long when the money stopped pouring into the coffers the business management saw the light negroes were hired operation breadbasket shrewdly concentrated first on dairies for the produce butter milk of dairies is perishable boycotts quickly show results there soft drink manufacturers are particularly vulnerable in the summer and campaigns were mounted to bring them into the hiring line dozens of truckdriving jobs paying to a year were made available to chicago negroes for the first time that the industries capitulated with such ease is in itself an indication of the widespread and longstanding inequity which characterizes the hiring policies of the firms even in those cases where the businesses employed some negroes a pattern of excluding negroes from toplevel jobs was clear operation breadbasket also demanded that negroes be upgraded in some of the boycotted firms chicagos operation breadbasket is an arm of the coordinating council of community organizationssouthern christian leadership council campaign against slums and their evils all the ministers of the community are invited to participate and most of those with some social consciousness and some sense of involvement in the freedom movement have done so a few notably influential ministers have refrained from lending their support to the program operation breadbasket is fortunate in chicago to have the services of a young minister and divinity student named jesse jackson not yet the rev mr jackson is blessed with the kind of balance and maturity which usually comes with age he is cool under fire determined and articulate but he also knows human psychology and something of the limitations of his movements power not the least important his wit and humor does not allow him to take himself too seriously not too many years ago after world war ii a azz pianist named thelonius monkal rnii ready a mature black artistwas struggling to be heard he had a new kind of music that some people couldnt quite understa it and others laughed at and called bebop we all know what has happened since this time and few people today are not familiar with monk and his music monk is now an accepted legitimate black artist what we dont know though is the hell that this man had to go through to be heard and appreciated and the fact that every black artist has these same terrifying barriers to go throughbarriers that take up a lot of unnecessary time for the black artist that has not made it the problem is how to reach a public that is controlled by people who to say the least are not with him i contend that every jazz lover if he could only see what black choreographers are doing in the field of modern dance would also be a dance fan but in this field the black artist finds himself in a strange position he knows the worth of his works he knows that the black public would appreciate and understand what he is saying as an artist yet he finds great difficulty in reaching not only the black public but any public at all lets face it the powersthatbe are not interested in seeing negroes in any way but as rhythmic freaks about whom they say they certainly do have a good sense of rhythm well i am not an animal and i wont tap dance or play the part of the maid i am a human being and have the same feelings that any other human being would have i dont want to entertain them if i am thrown in a ghetto and condemned to an outcast life of hating i am not going to create a ballet about swans it would be completely divorced from reality and a little bit insane if i did i can only create from the life around me i am sure that you realize as a black man or negro in american today it isnt pretty so when and if you do come to see my dances please dont expect to see pretty things the man that is the destroyer because he has had the seed of hate planted in him is what im talking aboutthe junkie my vision of harlem is that it is a modern equivalent of the slave auction bloc and the black mans work and worth is still being sold in a very subtle but direct way the auction block is the central motif of my work blues for the jungle premiered at an october concert at kaufmann auditorium in new york city the dancers who historically mount the block trace the development of the black man in america we see the railroad worker who built the west the jubilant new freedman the sanctified gospel people the blues singing entertainer the tap dancer and the junkie all of these people are the modern equivalent of slaves here in rich america today and because of this they end the work in a riot scene that shows they simply want to destroy what has destroyed them as human beings baby this is not swan lake this is america circa and any black artist worth the sweat on his back from creating has to deal with this reality which is exactly what is here now if you can see what i am creating now i certainly would appreciate it id hate to have to wait until the power structurepromoters and impresarios and you know who they arethink that you are ready in another or years in any case it is you that im talking to and its you that im talking about the blues i sing is our blues baby in early autumn last year a young britain of dutch birth and ancestry arrived in the united states for a particularly happy tour he had come to meet the galaxy of poets and novelists whose work he had knownand even publishedfor a number of years but who he had never met in person paul breman reached new york just in time to attend the ceremonies during which president leopold senghor of senegal presented awards to those americans who won in absentia grand prizes at last springs first world festival of negro arts in senegals capital city mr bremans new york host was poet langston hughes who he had met in detroit mr breman was guided by poet dudley randall in indianapolis by mari evans and in chicago by conrad kent rivers in new york mr breman met poet robert hayden winner of the festivals grand prize for poetry and an acquaintance and collaborator by correspondence up to that meeting in mr bremans capacity as publisher of the heritage series of volumes of poetry by north american negroes he had published a collection of mr haydens poems under the title also the title of the principal poem a ballad of remembrance the other three volumes in the series are sixes and sevens an anthology with many of the newer poets represented haverstraw a collection of poems by frank horne and personals a collection of poems by arna bontemps mr breman reported that a number of the elegant little volumes which he published at his own expense in london are still available and that they may be obtained by writing to him directly at wedder burn road london nw england as a consequence of his visit to the united states other volumes may now be in the works since mr bremans publishing venture to date has been primarily a labor of love it was presumed that some of his energies were directed toward some enterprise of a more certain remunerative nature that enterprise turned out to be the book business but a very special branch of it mr breman is an antiquarian bookseller or a procurer and vendor of rare old volumes in fact much of mr bremans sojourn on these shores was financed by the sale of a single rare old volume on stage chicagos hull house theatre which has established a south side branch offers classes in acting under the supervision of annette hankin formerly of actors studio the free southern theatre with a rockefeller foundation grant and a boost from the columbia broadcasting systems television series look up and live may be enroute to taking firm root in southern soil in july with tom dent at the helm the troupe was at home in a building in the desire section of new orleans during the summer the new heritage repertory theatre in harlem presented a series of performances in various locations in the ghetto the theatre is headed by roger furman and walter julio and is based at the hans christian andersen community center twice weekly the theatre went mobile on its tour of harlem frederick oneal president of actors equity received a certificate of appreciation on behalf of new york actors from the city of new york the certificate specifically praised the actors for outstanding contribution and exceptional services to the new york city antipoverty program because they performed without salaries for operation head start programs all over the city during the summer speaking of ruby dees performance during the ypsilanti mich greek theater festival last summer robert kotlowitz wrote in harpers magazine one revelation of the production is ruby dee who acts on the very edge of convulsion as cassandra when she is frustrated she simply lies down on the floor of the stage and thrashes around in agony no halfway measures here miss dee is clearly ripe for any part she would set her mind to both shaws and shakespeares cleopatra for example could use her talent which is made up of equal parts vigor suppleness conviction unusual stamina and a winning beautiful smile nat hentoff has a healthy list of literary credits and they grow more impressive each year his call the keeper viking is a brief but poignant display of his allround writing ability call the keeper is a fast reading novel perhaps even a novella which makes a swift excursion into black nationalism black nationalism is probably as old as black men but there are new inferences and ingredients as the black man continues his current search for himself in white america there are sequences in this book and messages which required some courage for hentoff to commit to paper this compensates for some of the false ring of the dialogue one of the most powerful characters sounds more like an english lord than an intellectual cop if you can imagine one hentoff makes some fairly sound statements about the basic philosophies and rationale of black nationalism as it now stands further he seems to have something of an idea of what its all about which is more than most negroes for example can honestly claim despite the fact that the book is about black nationalism one of the most attractive characters is randal a white musician i am not certain that hentoff intended this to be so but when randal is compared against other characters he seems to be the hippest of the lot randal simply is he plays randal white jazz musician he has the respect of the black chauvinist who leads the group randal plays in because he doesnt try to be black he plays out of what he knows this is perhaps the best message of the book a man simply has to play what he knows otherwise you sound like the sons of mothers who had colored maidsbrooks johnson ri the world of jakov lind is a place of unending horror there is no corner in it where the reader may settle down amongst familiar and normal signs and souls and be for a while at peace his collection of short stories soul of wood was such a place peopled by creatures out of a nightmare so real that it was impossible to dispel them and his new novel landscape in concrete grove is also such a place the central character of this picaresquefantasy is a german soldier named bachmann the time is the last months of world war ii when the wehrmacht is suffering defeats on the eastern front and there is an atmosphere of disarray and desperation bachmann is lost from his unit somewhere on the eastern frontwhile in retreat his unit was mired in mud and the novel begins with bachmann alone in a forest far from the front but he is not alone for long he comes upon a strange weasellike creature a soldier like himself who lives in a burrow in the ground the soldiers team up sharing a forest hut and a goose dinner but they are natural enemies the antipathy of each other the one burly and not very bright the other razorthin and as cunning as a cat the one stolid and disciplined the other sensitive and devious and bachmann the heavy plodding embodiment of all the germanic virtues outwitted and deceived ends by executing his antagonist but it is not his only murder in norway where bachmanns erratic search for his comrades leads him he calmly shoots down three members of a wealthy family on orders from a sinister civilian bent on exploiting his uncanny power over the german bachmann finds his way back to germany to the town where the girl he would marry is waiting passing her time evading the amorous attentions of her benefactress and bestowing her favors on imported laborers from nonnordic lands this girla mountain of a femalehas been ever in his dreams but when she is finally in his arms he sleeps but bachmann is mad he has been adjudged so and his flight across germany has been undertaken in an effort to regain his status as a sane man and as a true son of the fatherland for he is a patriot and it is impossible to imagine not serving his country in the end however having acceptedno insisted uponhis madness he is told that he is indeed quite sane and that he is absentwithoutleave from his unit he is sane then the world is mad these are the bare outlines of landscape in concrete conveying nothing of the special quality of terror and cynicism and symbolism with which the novel abounds for despite the figures of ridicule and satire evil overblown what emerges is merely a picture of a universe beyond the pale and that is imaginable that is believable indeed in reading landscape in concrete one can begin to comprehend the horror which flowered in germany and threatened to overshadow the world and one can begin to see how approval of murder in mississippi can set the stage for american buchenwalds the budding flower landscape in concrete is a grotesquely compelling novel it also is a warning thomas e eliots classic statement on the metaphysical poets in an essay by that title in is too well known to warrant explication here yet besides contributing to or more accurately spearheading the impetus for the revival of the metaphysicals as objects of study the essay stands as a classic example of the power and influence wielded conjointly by the critic and ralph ellison the university eliots essay gave rise to a new group of critics who less judicious than either dr samuel johnson or matthew arnold have dictated the tastes and forms of english literature mainly in america for over a decade and those new critics in most instances were connected with the university either in teaching positions or through prestige and influence the trend in recent years toward a different type of orientation in most cases going back to the biographicalhistorical method of taine and saint beuve only serves to point up the importance of both the critic and the university in determining not only literary standards but to a great degree the works which in the judgment of the combine criticsenglish professors meet these standards the result has been of course a dictatorship which makes the dictators of oldpope dryden dr johnsonseem like new deal democrats those who have been damaged most severely under the iron rule of this combine are negro writers never taken seriously in the american society never conceived of as much more than a protester the negro writer today despite james baldwin and ralph ellison fares little better among the men of the ivory tower than his predecessor saunders redding has adequately summed up the argument against the anthology writers who refuse to anthologize selections of negro authors yet the nucleus of the problem lies in the classroom itself and here the negro members of the combine are as guilty as the white members recently a young graduate of a distinguished negro college in the south who had majored in english literature and had taken several courses in american literature asked me after thumbing through one of the books on my shelf who is this man i never heard of him before this man was james weldon johnson and the book was his autobiography of an excolored man to document the ignorance of the white collegian would be needless for few white students to whom i have talked have knowledge of any negro writer outside of the big three wright baldwin and ellison however the example of a professor may serve as a case in point the professor holding a doctorate in english literature and at one time chairman of the department of a university renown for its english department on reading a paper of mine with saunders redding as the subject implored me to find out if the works of saunders redding could be found in the university library i think he remarked that every student should read the works of this man thank you for bringing him to my attention this was in and saunders reddings first book appeared in but more than ignorance of the works of negro writers is involved here much more pernicious are the concerted efforts by critics and professors to dispute the charges brought against the american society by the negro writer without having to engage in a dialectic the concept of the liberal professor willing to acquiesce in change and to examine the new and different is a concept nonapplicable to the professors of english departments for the most part english professors are the most zealous conservative upholders of the status quo more inclined to quote dr johnson to champion that which is right because it is established than that which is established because it is right a case in point is professor robert bones book the negro novel in america which for some years now has served as a source book for any study dealing with negro literature professor bone pretends to examine his subject with the scrutiny of the objective literary historian yet throughout the book bone drops his mask to record his personal reaction to any statement or any work as a whole that dares to point accurately to the reality of the american society let us hope it will not be taken as evidence of american chauvinism if we point out that there are in fact important differences between the negros status in philadelphia and in georgia between the systematic genocide of the hitler government and the supreme court decision of he writes in explicating william gardner smiths last of the conquerors if we concede that professor bone is not being chauvinistic we must then assume thatfor want of a better wordhe is being naive if we substitute new york for philadelphia not the philadelphia of when smiths book was published but today when according to bone great progress has been made and accept the basic contention of bones argument that the negro is better off in new york than in georgia then we would be hard put to explain why the most vocal voices of protest against the american society are the voices of two new yorkers james baldwin and leroi jones but the second half of the statement is not only naive but ludicrous in that bone attempts a feat of logical legerdemain which would not deceive even a first year philosophy major the analogy between the systematic genocide of the hitler government and the supreme court decision of is no analogy at all better would be the analogy between the genocide of the hitler government and the lynching of over negroes a recorded number which does not include justifiable homicide a favorite phrase of northern police courts or deaths from unknown causes such as bodies found in the mississippi river during the search for the bodies of chaney goodman and schwerner but this is an analogy which professor bone cannot bring himself to make and those negro writers who make such analogies receive the most devastating attacks in bones anthology nothing better illustrates this fact than the almost hysterical critique of the works of james baldwin in less than pages bone asserts that baldwin is everything from a sexual maniac to a psychopath indeed sex becomes the organizing principle around which bone bases his criticism of baldwin but clear to the reader is the fact that bone has undertaken a defense of the sexual and racial mores of the american society james baldwin in particular and the negro protest writer in general is then his dragon and he bone is the societys st george for an example of how baldwin can be criticized sanely and from an unbiased point of view see saunders reddings since richard wright and the problem of the negro writer but bone at least has the courage of his convictions unlike other instructors and critics bone brings his contentions out into the open and he discusses ofttimes skillfully the deficiencies of many negro novels yet the majority of the instructors of english literature those in positions of responsibility make no such effort in many universities both negro and white one may receive a doctorate without having read one line by a negro author in a western university whose english department ranks among the best in the country the only negro author included in the syllabus is ralph ellison in fact the selection of ellison evidences the fact that tokenismnot confined only to the industrial and social sphere of the american society some time ago when an english department wished to display its propensity for taking all literature as its province richard wrights native son was ushered forth to prove that the university had its one negro representative for some reason the wright stock has nosedived but a successor in the form of james baldwin was quickly ushered in to retain the universitys image but alas the baldwin stock proved to be even less solvent than the wright stock baldwin lasted only about three years and to fill the gap ralph ellison was quickly brought forth the reasons for ellisons ascension to university eminence range from the oftquoted but true statement that invisible man is a supreme accomplishment in its own right to the assertion an assertion which both irving howe and ralph ellison have given credence to that invisible man is not a protest novel invisible man remarked a college professor deals with modern man in the universe not an isolated negro in an oppressive society nearer the truth is the fact that ellisons novel no less that the novels of james baldwin is a protest novel the only difference and an essential one is that ellison has clothed his novel in myth and symbolism so skillfully that the average critic is unable or unwilling to search for the protest beyond the symbols and myth another user of symbols and myths william blake has not been as fortunate in this respect as ellison scholars have looked for the meaning behind the blakean symbols and have discovered that poor old blake was an avid protestor after all this has not however caused his literary demise but instead has added to his prestige the ability to deal with ellison then by skirting the indictment of the american society means that ellison will be read in universities for a long time to come yet the majority of negro writers and i mean the good ones though being good has been no criterion for the selection of white authors for college syllabi will remain unread in colleges both negro and white for the american society is not yet capable of looking at the negro through glasses cleansed of years of prejudice and the combine which controls the selection of the material which could do most to erase this distorted impression exercises its vast power in a negative manner lee came into v the cafe to drink some if beer he had worked hard today it had rained too much to do any plowingcouldnt put a tractor out in that delta land when it was wet the rich loose top soil was so deep that a tractor would sink down in it so his boss man had made him dig ditches all day ditches that led nowhere the man had only required the work of him in order to keep him busy and ossie lee had had to dig the ditches there wasnt much else he could do he lived on the mans place in his house owed him money but ossie lee set aside his thoughts he wouldnt worry about all that now just sit here and rest a while spend the dollar he had in his pocket for some beer and wait on his friends from the other plantations to come around miss lula bring me a quart of falstaff and some skins miss lula came over to the table she was a big woman not yet old maybe she called everybody baby how you doing baby look like you been working hard got that mud all over your clothes in your hair a good looking man like you ought to take better care of himself you still younghow old are you bout

broke down like a lot of the men around here and i always did like the way you held yourself you know like couldnt nobody walk over you miss lula was smiling she was pleased to be able to speak so well of him maybe hed feel a little better now ossie lee appreciated her effort and replied in kind well miss lula i always liked the way you carried yourself too it took some doing to keep the cafe open without even a man to help you you a pretty good old lady even if you are getting fat from your own cooking she feinted a slap at his head for this little insult and then resumed her businesslike air i got to see what jimmie lee and them want over at the bar ill bring you your falstaff soons i take care of them i got some good neckbones cooked in the back you want to try some no miss lula i ate at mamas already just bring me the beer ossie lee put his foot up on the next chair and looked around to see who was there it had taken him a while to get used to the darkness the only light came from the schlitz beer signs with the luxuriously dressed brown girls and from the music box which commanded one end of the small cafe nobody was there that he knew well hed just wait nothing else to do no reason to go home there were two girls sitting over in the corner of the cafe he had not seen them before looked like they might be sisters the smaller girl was very pretty she was black and so thin that you felt you could see everything that was happening within her the movement of every muscle the angle of every bone he liked the way she looked he figured that they were from up on mr mills place he had heard that mills had brought in a new family up there miss lula returned to his table here baby heres your falstaff she noticed ossie lees feet in her chair her lips tightened now why you want to mess up my chairs putting your feet on them come on and do right always wanting me to keep this place but youall wont help me to keep it up you years old had a house of your own you know how to treat other peoples things ossie lee was offended but he took his feet down he couldnt afford to get her mad with him miss lula had a shotgun back there that she would put to anybody seeing that she had put ossie lee in his place she resumed her friendly manner she said i guess you pretty lonesome now since your wife left you i never did know what happened what did happen nothing much she was mess ing around james edwardyou know him he live down on mr hendersons placeand i wasnt going to have that everytime i told her about it she tried to get smart with me so id just have to whip her she musta got tired of that one day she went down the road to the store and just kept walking didnt even take her clothes yeah well where is she now she sent three bus tickets for the children the tickets were to memphis i guess thats where she is now miss lula stood quietly at the table for a moment then she directed his attention across the room you see those two girls over there in the corner they just come over to this county come from up in tallahatchie county a week ago some nice girls too named minnie pearl and johnnie mae the thin little black one with the yellow dress on minnie pearl she loves to dance why dont you put a quarter in the music box shell dance for you ossie lee looked at the cents he had left from his dollar he weighed the value of spending it now on the little black girl against the possibility that later he might get somebody to match it and buy another quart of beer he didnt know anything about the girl but she did look nice she was a pretty girl he hadnt been getting much satisfaction from drinking beer or from doing anything else lately seemed like no matter what he did he couldnt get satisfied the disappointments of his life weighed heavily on him in fact ossie lee had for the sake of his sanity accepted his life situation he had yielded to it long ago at the age of eight the acceptance of his life style had been irrevocably forced upon him the night they came to take him that night they called ossie lees father to the door they were two jesse come here want to talk to you bout that smartacting boy of yours his father turned to his mother get them in the back sarah mae she hurried the children ranging in age from years to three months into the back of the tworoom house his father went to the front door forced a smile to his face how yall this evening we fine jesse only thing wrong with us is that boy of yours ossie lee he let one of my chickens get run over this morning send him out here got to teach him a lesson he got to learn to take care of property else he aint never going to be a good hand ossie lee saw his fathers shoulders drop well sir mr perry i knew he been running too much aint got good sense yet but he still young i give him a good whipping tonight he do better no jesse i think i ought to take care of this myself he going to be working for me years he got to learn how to take care of my things realizing that he was in trouble ossie lee slipped over to where his mother had gathered the smallest children perry ignoring ossie lees father walked straight through the house and into the back he had a long cotton sack on his arm sarah mae give me the boy ossie lees arms went around his mothers waist she folded him into her skirt pressed him to her she pleaded with the boss man please sir dont take him off he just a baby just made eight years we take care he dont do nothing like that no more spare him this one time he just a baby perry did not bother to respond ossie lee looked up at his mother and over to his father for help neither his father nor his mother could look back into his face he began to cry no mama dont let him take me mama daddy mama in support of him the other children set to crying perry seemed not to hear or to see any of them he leaned over to ossie lee pulled him from his mother and despite the boys kicking and struggling forced him into the cotton sack as perry moved toward the door no one offered resistance ossie lee cried hard he knew that they must have heard him were they going to let this man take him away why didnt they run after him and pull the sack from his hands mama daddy you always took care of me where are you perry carried the boy out in the sack and handed him to the other man who had been waiting in the truck he cranked up the truck and drove away no one came even to the porch to see in what direction their boy had been taken as the truck moved away ossie lee came to understand that his people could neither refuse to let him be taken nor even demand the knowledge of where he would be taken understanding this he himself ceased to struggle against so obviously powerful a force his kicking subsided his crying ceased his muscles relaxed he merely waited to see what they would do to him after riding about minutes the truck stopped ossie lee was pulled from the truck and emptied from the sack onto the ground they had come to the muddy river where ossie lee had fished only a few days earlier the white men stood over him perry said boy you been mighty careless lately letting that chicken get run over dont seem like you want to be a good hand do it ossie lees immediate reaction was to defend himself to assert that he had been watching the chickens as best he could but that there had just been too many of them that he couldnt have kept up with all those chickens but then he checked himself he admitted that nothing he said would matter to these powerful men that it was their show and not his accordingly he replied thats right sir look like i aint able to be no good hand perry went on you got to learn to take care of property thats whats wrong with you colored people now you dont know how to take care of nothing im going to give you this whipping so youll watch after them chickens from now on get your britches down for the last time ossie lees self revolted no not my clothes you cant make me take off my clothes daddy dont even do that no perry stood over him you not going to do what i tell you well ill take them off for you and ignoring the last willful act that ossie lee was to perform in his lifetime the white man tore off his britches and began to whip him with a corded rope perry whipped him until he got tired and then the other man whipped him they kept it up for about minutes it hurt badly and ossie lee cried but he didnt really care anymore when they finished they shouted some words at him and left him lying by the river at which he used to play ossie lee waited until they left and gathered strength to clothe himself and return home in another half hour he made it home his parents were waiting for him in the same positions they had held when earlier they had allowed him to be carried off his father stood by the door alone his mother sat in the back room only the smallest children looked into his face as he opened the door and entered the dimly lit house at his arrival the family went back to its normal activities his mother gave the baby to carrie the sevenyearold and set about cooking some bread for supper the older children went out to get water and wood for the next morning the little children began to harass one another ossie lee said nothing he went over to his space on the bed which he shared with three brothers and lay down and buried his face in the quilt his only effort was not to think not to assess the situation which an hour ago had been thrust upon him soon after he had laid down his mother called him to supper she handed him two tin plates with biscuits and molasses here take your daddy his supper too ossie lee walked to the front and gave his father his supper he sat down on the floor next to his father and began to eat his father leaned over took the boys head in his hand and gently shook him you alright boy yessir im alright thats just the way things is you know yessir i know the remainder of ossie lees life followed the order established that night he did carefully what he was told never more never less along with the other children he tended the animals and chopped and picked the cotton and when each year after the cotton had been laid by it came to be revival time he too went to the mourners bench and got religion when he was big enough he was told to start driving a tractor this he did and continued to do for the rest of his life he learned to drink whiskey and to go with women at some point he married and brought forth three children to share the life which had devastated him through it all there was something in him which refused the final admission that he was dirt under white folks feet and that he deserved the dehumanization that they meted out to him yet he could not reject it he felt too old to leave home and start over again and since his father had died and his older brothers had left for chicago he had to stay on the place and do the mans work so that his mother and the children would have a house to live in and something to eat thus being able neither to accept nor to reject his life ossie lee had constantly to buffer himself against it but lately things had been going badly more closely each week dissatisfaction had approached his consciousness and he no longer had the means to push it back he still found comfort in the church and release in fighting and drinking with his friends but not like before now it was hard work to get happy ossie lee had grown weary in the defense of himself after he had finished his beer miss lula came back over to his table she encouraged him further about the girl sitting across the room go on and put your little quarter in the music box aint going to do you no good sitting there ossie lee looked across at the girl once more he did like the way she looked under miss lulas prodding ossie lee walked across the small room to the glowing big bellied music box and deposited his quarter he turned his head toward the girls yall want to come choose some records come get the music you want and dance for me the girls conferred with one another for a minute and then came over to where he stood they looked to be about years old ossie lee studied the little black one she looked clean had a pretty face as he watched her she looked from the music box to him assessing her new arena of activity her sister asked him his name where he lived and all that she said nothing only kept time to the music until her sister would be ready to dance when the music burst from the music box the two girls joined hands and danced together they danced lithely gracefully to ossie lee the little black girl so thin in her loosely fitting yellow dress looked especially graceful his senses followed her and were refreshed he followed her so closely that for the while that she danced for him he was able to push away the disturbing consciousness of his life as she danced he relaxed and leaned back on the music box to watch her when the music ended the girls went back to their seats laughing and talking breathless from their dancing later someone fed more coins to the music box this time it sent forth blues music slow pounding insightful music about loving and living ossie walked quickly over to the girl in order to reach her before anyone else when he brought her to him to dance it was as he had expected her body fitted itself to him fitted itself and then relaxed into him as they moved slowly with the music he pulled her still closer drinking in the ease with which she lived and moved they danced for an inmeasurable time when finally they sat to rest neither spoke he remained beside her for several minutes and finding no words stood up and walked over to where some friends were lounging against the far wall they received him without comment he too leaned against the wall propping himself with his booted foot he inquired of them that little girl got a man round here one of the men answered no dont think so she aint been here but a few weeks and aint none of us hit on her yet we just been watching her miss lula watches her pretty close miss lula really likes that girl aint let us get next to her say we dont mean her no good she likes for us all to dance and have fun but she dont want you to take that girl nowhere ossie lee grunted something in acknowledgement and walked away from them he kept walking through the door and on to his mothers house his life thereafter was centered around evenings at the cafe his days assumed a strange proportion the mornings went quickly he easily did his plowing ran his boss mans errands and carried the other hands home from the field to eat dinner he was eager to make the day go by so that evening would come but then after dinner when the evening was indeed near time seemed to stand still every task took forever the cotton rows seemed to be miles longer than they had been in the morning it seemed that evening would never come when finally the work day ended ossie lee would go home and so that he could savor every aspect of being with her he would force himself to change his clothes in a leisurely manner and to walk slowly up the road to the cafe when one evening he directed her from the dance floor to the door of the cafe she followed him outside he motioned to her to get into his ford as he cranked up the car he turned to her were going to get your things i want to marry you you can stay with me and mama this week and next saturday well marry ill get you a house soon as i can the girl turned to face him what about your wife shes gone she knew what she was doing when she left do you want to marry or dont you she said yes she would marry ossie lee drove to her mothers threeroom house some of the children were sitting on the sagging porch trying to fight off the mosquitoes and to get some cool air she went in spoke a few words to her mother and her sisters and gathered her things to go with him her mother came to the porch to see them off as the girl climbed back into the car her mother called to her you know you can always come back home at ossie lees home the girl was well received his mother was glad to have another woman around to help in the field and to see after the children the children liked her at once she played with them yet took them seriously and she danced with them even with the baby who couldnt walk in the evenings ossie lee took her to the cafe when he told miss lula that they were to marry she shook her head she sat down at the table with them and took the girls hand in hers she said baby i dont know how to say this but i dont think you should marry its too much in you for you to go off with some man now i wish you wouldnt do it im a old lady i seen a lot a pretty black girls but you got something special dont throw it away i know you got to live and you got to help your mama well it aint enough work here for two but ill give you a job here in my cafe if youll just stay on with your mama the girl understood she answered simply i think the best thing is for me to go with ossie lee the older woman turned to him you a good man alright ossie but you dont mean this girl no good you ought to let her stay home let her stay out where she can dance ossie lee chose to take her words lightly he laughed you better get away from here talking like that me and minnie pearl going to marry on sunday and everybody is invited to the wedding down at pilgrims rest miss lula turned back to the girl remember baby if anything happen you got a friend here the girl smiled thanks miss lula ill remember andill be alright they married on sunday later in the week ossie lee saw his boss man about getting a house for them to live in the man told him where he could have one but he said it might have to be cleaned up some then ossie lee and his wife went to look at the house it was an old wooden tworoom house with a tin roof because of its age the whole building leaned to one side it was filled to the ceiling with hay ossie lee was slapped again by the circumstances of his life he sat down on the broken steps and leaned his back against the wooden roof support that bastard expects folks to live in a place that he wont use for nothing better than hay i dont know sometimes i just dont know his girl stood on the porch between him and the door of the house she said to him thats alright well fix it up come on lets go up to the cafe for a while no i dont want to go to the cafe i dont want to go nowhere he walked away from the shack his head down and his arms dangling loosely she followed him to his mothers house ossie lee came into the house stepping over children and around beds and ducking electrical wires he laid across the bed she laid down next to him and tried to make him feel better youll see it will be nice well get the hay out put in some windows buy some curtains from the ten cent store he just lay there when he tired of the noises of the house he sat up on the bed come on lets get out of here as they walked slowly up to the cafe she tried to take his hand but he shook his loose he didnt want her hand she couldnt help nothing could help nothing could remove the fact of that hayfilled shack to which he would take his wife they entered the cafe and took seats at a table in the middle of the room she looked around the room for her sister recognizing her in the back she went over to talk with her soon someone put a dime in the music box and the two girls began to dance ossie lee watched his girl she danced with the same ease and enjoyment that she always had but he could not come out to her he could no longer lose himself in her dancing he was held too tightly to the hayfilled shack too closely to all the meaningless ditches he had dug as he sat immobile in the chair he grew angry how could she dance like that when she had just seen that place what kind of a fool was she to think that there was anything to be happy about any place on earth to relax as he watched her his anger grew still more and his muscles stiffened he pulled himself up and went outside to get some air he sat down on the steps rested his head on the wall and looked out into the darkness a big hand descended on his shoulder it was his cousin willie c willie c was a tall thin brownskinned man with most of his teeth missing he and ossie had grown up together he leaned his dirty sweating face to within inches of ossie lees hey ossie lee i aint seen you out by yourself in a long time not since you got that little black girl from up on mr mills place i got some old corn whiskey out in the car jake and fats they out there now drinking it all up come on drink some with us before its all gone he pulled at ossie lees shoulder ossie lee said alright man lets go they went around back of the cafe to where the other two men were standing ossie lee helped them to finish off the pint of whiskey which they passed around he drank quickly thanked them and left he went back around into the cafe and took the seat he had had earlier in the evening his girl was at the table laughing and talking with her sister about finding her a husband they tried to include him in the talk but he only grunted when the music started the girls once more got up to dance she asked him you want to dance when he did not answer she went off with her sister again he watched her move and his anger swelled he could not permit her to dance like that not today not in the face of that hayfilled shack ossie lee held himself in his seat for as long as he could by looking the other way by talking to people at the next table but he could not ignore the pounding of the music he could not negate the sound of her laughter as she danced he rose from his chair walked over to his beautiful black girl and slapped her to the floor she got back to her feet but was too stunned to hit back at him again he hit her now in her stomach she doubled over in pain the other people who had been dancing moved back from the couple only the girls sister pushed her way over to her screaming at ossie lee to stop hitting her sister she enclosed her sister in her arms and stared back at ossie lee who was readying to fight her too as he approached them he was stopped by the sound of a gunshot the crowd moved aside for miss lula she placed the barrel of the gun into his side her face was tightly drawn her eyes shining her arms holding steadily to the gun ossie lee dont you touch that girl again in my place if you got something to settle take her home but as long as she is anywhere near where i am you cant hurt her now get out of here he turned to the girl you coming with me she nodded yes the two walked away from the cafe back to his mothers house at home they silently prepared for bed the thin black girl slipped into bed beside her husband he took her in his arms for hours he caressed her aroused her loved her he worked with her until he felt sure that he had given her a baby a baby which would weigh her down and destroy her balance so that she would dance no more the breeze moved in from the lake and across the campus e brisk and with the faint sharp smell of winter only a short time away don watched a leaf break away from a limb and start toward the ground he switched his books to his left hand and let the sounds of people greeting each other as they moved across campus break into his thoughts he realized again how natural it had all seemed and how he took such things for granted in high school so many centuries ago it must be at least that long but he knew it had been only a short time longer than a month when he had first reported for early freshman football practice it had been lonely as only a college campus can be without studentsdeserted empty stagnant it was as different from the same place as a football with no air discarded and forgotten during the summer months hed known it would be different when the students began returning for registration and it had been he found for the first time that the difference between loneliness in a place without people and loneliness in a crowd is a difference in intensity it was a comparison of pain such as the difference between a shin splintthat dull annoying ache along the shin bone that comes from running too much on hard ground that could be forgotten completely in the gameand the sharp biting pain from a pulled muscle that slowed you down and held you back no matter how tightly taped loneliness was pain and like all pain you could learn to live with it but he could never quite forget its first bite when the crowd of returning students first gathered in the union snack shack he stood in the surging laughing crowd and he had never felt so lost as in the shouts of greeting and the inquiries of how the summers had been spent he hadnt even had the compensation of being one of the many other freshmen who could share misery of being new alone and so on the outside of things because he had been on the campus early and had registered two weeks before and when the newcomers had been drawn to others like themselves recognized from the endless registration lines to enviously watch the easy closeness of the upperclassmen over a coke he was shagging punts on the practice field he entered the snack shack in the union basement and waited in line for a coke he walked into the lounge and scanned the crowd for a familiar face and walked toward terry bates who had been his roommate in the athletic barracks until hed been cut from the squad because he was too slow for a tformation fullback and too small for a lineman terry had pledged his older brothers fraternity and moved into the house and he hadnt seen much of him since he walked to the table spoke sat down and was introduced to terrys pledge brothers talk about the team and the coming season drifted into the party at the house that weekend and he was glad that he no longer had to contribute because ann bennett came in laughing in that fresh easy manner as always with that easy glide that had caught his eye the first day of practice anns father was a member of the faculty and she had been on the campus before the other students began to arrive her father had been an allconference quarterback some years back and ann was often with him she had led an orientation tour early the first week and was in his english and history classes and on this basis he developed a speaking acquaintance that had advanced to the smalltalk stage and hed called a few times and had been refused a date and the more he saw of her the more he wanted to see of her his glass was empty and so was the talk at the table so he got up and walked toward anns table in high school he had always laughed at the way fellows would describe the trouble they had talking to a girl they happened to like but now he felt just as he did before the kickoff for a big game hi ann how are you hi she returned and her smile tied his stomach into knots hows english coming finished your theme for the week well just about ill probably finish it tonight and he wondered what to say next if she didnt ask him to sit down he could feel her friends staring at him and he wondered what they were thinking and he felt his palm moist on his books he found he was looking to see the color of her eyes they were a deep dark brownalmost black he suddenly knew she wouldnt ask him to sit down and he moved off stammering something about the english assignment who was that ann hes kinda cute gee i dont know i can never remember his name hes in my english class hes only a freshman though she pondered a moment she should know his name it wasnt important however anyone want another coke im going over to the counter don watched as his ankles were being taped and felt himself beginning to withdraw it would keep up like this until everything around him would be hazy and far off and he would be almost sleepy he always wondered about the pregame tension being described as butterflies in the stomach because his stomach only felt tight as if he had tensed his muscles and they had frozen stiff it would be like this until he was hit or threw a block or caught a pass and then everything would be all right he pulled on his shoulder pads and tried to think about ann bennett but he couldnt because todays game kept crowding in this was the final scrimmage before the season opened and the freshmen and varsity squads had been combined and divided into equal teams the last squad cut depended on todays performance ann was a question mark but football was no mystery all he wanted was his signal and the ball in his hands he sat on the bench watching the game and waiting to be called he knew there was a question of his being cut in spite of his record in high school because he came from upstate and the conference was made up of smalltown schools and he could easily be another upstate flash who failed to stand up under the tougher competition his high school coach had told him not to worry that everything would be all right once he got into a game he was the type athlete who no one noticed in practice who could never seem to have the drive and the speed and the fire that had every eye on him in a game from the first time he carried the ball his eyes were halfclosed slits now and he almost seemed not to breathe he wanted his hands on the ball and he wanted the sharp clean thrill of body contact the tension built slowly inside him and he could release it only when he was out on the field doing the thing he loved more than anything else he knew he was in the huddle at last and the mixed smell of sharp sweat and green grass quickened his pulse he heard his play called and he licked his lips and almost smiled he moved forward hard and seemed to hear the signal after he started toward the line though he knew it had started his motion the quarterback was almost too slow moving around for the handoff because he had never started as fast in the signal drills theyd run he got the ball and saw the hole open just before he reached the line steve johnson was moving in with that deceptively swift motion that had made him an allamerican line backer don faked to the left saw him hesitate and drove hard to the right he felt an arm slap his leg but he was free and he knew he would go all the way and he could almost taste the feeling he would have when he was in the clear and the goal was coming closer he watched the defensive halfback and safety as he drifted towards the sidelines don looked across the lake and wondered how long it would be before it froze and thought of the picture of the people ice skating on its glazed surface that had looked so inviting in the catalogue the reg istrar had sent him he thought of the girl in his last class who had never spoken to him before and how she smiled so warmly and congratulated him on the game yesterday and of the people he didnt know who had been speaking on the campus all day it was real easy to make it from an outsider to a guy everyone spoke to and smiled atall you had to do was score three touchdowns in a football game it wasnt for him he was the same person nobody had known or cared about the day before and those characters could go jump in the lake before it froze over this was the place the catalogue talked about with the songs and lifelong friendships it had said nothing about bringing along a football to get acquainted with people he suddenly felt so homesick for the crowd at home in the drugstore after practice that he wanted to throw his books across the campus his desk lamp threw weird shadows on the walls and the french book lay open at the same page he had started on an hour before he thought of the girl who had never spoken before and how she told him which dorm she lived in three times in her conversation and how they were having an open house sunday and why didnt he stop over if he had time because shed love to show him the place and maybe they could study together sometime because he seemed to know so much about the subject and she was just lost and how did it feel to score three touchdowns in one game and she bet he would make allamerican his first season just like the papers said he thought of all the people who suddenly knew his name and smiled and waved on the campus and of terrys brother who had urged him to come to the rush next week because he felt he was the type man his fraternity sought it was real easythree touchdowns he heard his buzz from the bell on the wall and walked to the phone in the hall it was ann and he felt his palms begin to sweat why hadnt he called lately and how did he like the campus and how was english coming along and congratulations on his wonderful performance and then it was hard remembering the rest it was something about a party that weekend and would he like to be her date and he was hating himself more than her for saying yes three touchdowns he walked back to the room and the bitterness was a knot in his throat and he thought of calling her and breaking the date he thought of this idea and smiled at her imagined reaction he sat down at the desk and read awhile he stopped and stood up walked to the door and fingered through his ties the blue gray and red would go well with his new charcoal suit he would have to look sharp this weekend for those with hearty appetites for violence it is no longer necessary to stay awake half the night watching late late shows on television nowadays one only has to tune in a newscast to see the sights and hear the sounds of violence in american society there is sufficient variety to satisfy every taste or proclivity and for those who prefer a less vicarious violence than the news of the day offers more direct exposure and excitement are readily available for example one might want to spend the january or spring collegiate holidays at some beach where students congregate to riot or later in the season go to newport for all the jazzgovernor wallace of alabama who is no novice about violence has recommended a ride on a philadelphia subway since should you not witness an assault or have the fortune to be attacked there is at least the chance of being bitten by a police dog according to the new york daily news which also betrays an affection for violence those who would prefer their action aboveground should take a stroll in central park at night italianamericans can seek membership in the mafia while white gentile protestants as usual have the most options since they are eligible for the american nazi party the minutemen the ku klux klan and the john birch society with the right connections in certain localities careers in violence are apparently still possible in the teamsters union those who would be victims rather than aggressors need only burn their draft cards the young and hardy can enlist in the marines and with any sort of luck end up in vietnam as perhaps a final resort one can become a cop and seek assignment to occupation duty in one of the black ghettos of the urban north all this of course is only a way of saying that violence is manifold and commonplace in american society it seems always to have been so in the colonial protests for fair taxation and political independence and in the revolution itself in the indian wars and the conquest of the frontier in the war between the states and the trauma of the reconstruction crisis in the emergence of the labor union movement and in the era of prohibitionto mention but a handful of historical examplesas well as in the present day whether violence is more widespread today than in earlier times i seriously doubt but how could any accurate measurement possibly be made whether there is a pattern of violence peculiar to our time which did not previously exist i equally doubtprobably no one really knows whether the violence modern society suffers is more vehement than in other periods is impossible to assess what is most significantly different today is that communications are virtually instantaneous the whole country watched ruby shoot oswald the impact of the incidents and images of violence is immediate upon the consciousness if not always upon the consciences of citizens everyone saw the troopers savagely charge then lash and gas and stomp the selma marchers on black sunday in march of all knew immediately when and how and who murdered jonathan daniels the watts riot kept millions watching their tv sets what is different now is that the facts of violence cannot be ignored or rationalized or suppressed or even distorted too much because there are so many onlookers to every violence that makes it difficult to accountin a rational wayfor the popularity especially among the white middle classes in both north and south of the falsehood which equates civil_rights demonstrations with violence in the streets one recalls however that this mistaken notion has had faint echoes from ordinarily responsible quarters notably in statements of former president truman ridiculing civil_rights demonstrations such as the selma march and in some of the general lamentations for former president eisenhower about the disruption of law and order before that however the alleged equation of civil_rights protests and violence gained notorious currency in the presidential campaign indeed this propaganda became so abrasive and blatantly exploitive that senator goldwater himself was moved to repudiate some of his campaign material as racist that repudiation has not of course prevented others most notably the john birchers from persevering in the same savage lie the truth however is that violence initiated by negro and other citizens in the civil_rights movement has been rare and minimalso farespecially so if the scope duration and depth of the protests are taken into account the overwhelming number of acts of violence in the american racial crisis has been instigated and executed by white people their murders tortures mutilations and bombings of negroes have almost always been perpetrated with impunity if not actually accomplished either directly or collusively by the police authorities themselves from through the end of there have been sixtyone homicides directly related to civil_rights as to which there has yet to be a single conviction for murder or manslaughter it is not possible to ascertain how many other homicides have been committed which have never even been reported on a police blotter no plaintive rationalizations can erase that dismal record no amount of whitewash can conceal that much blood the violence that has erupted in which negroes have taken the initiativeso farhas been in the riots and skirmishes in the ghettos of northern cities it is hard to determine what degree of violence is necessary to have classification as a riot but by my own calculation there have been seventeen ghetto riots in and whatever the computation these incidents have not beenso far associated with any civil_rights demonstrations as such there remains an urgent need for an objective inquiry into the causes of the riots they cannot fairly be blamed upon negro civil_rights leaders in fact negro civil_rights leaders have done much more than any others both to curtail the riots and to work on the scene inside the ghettos after the riots have been quelled bayard rustin dissuaded some in the harlem riots from exploding a cache of dynamite that was capable of obliterating an entire city block dick gregory was wounded while pleading for a halt to the rioting in watts the southern christian leadership conference has established a beachhead in chicagos black belt and the northern student movement has been working for months in several eastern cities to forestall or ameliorate riotprone tensions the negro civil_rights leaders who have been committed for so long to the ethics and tactics of nonviolence recognize of course that the riots immediately pose a threat to their philosophy and strategy of social change they also realize what apparently most white people cannot comprehendthat nonviolence can prevail in the negro revolution only if it yields significant results perhaps malcolm_x the assassinated leader of the black muslims knew this truth better than anyone he was much misunderstood and editorially maligned as an advocate of violence this is not true he doubted that passive resistance would bring substantive progress foreseeing that it might evoke a greater recalcitrance toward change among the whites in the face of that prospect he did not advocate aggressive violence by negroes against white society but he did uphold the conviction that when a man is assaulted he has the dignity and right to defend himselfone of the most vulnerable principles of anglosaxon common law i am an episcopalian not a quaker although i trust a peaceful man i am not an ideological pacifist i do not assume that all violence is the same or that every incident of violence is to be uncritically deplored or that one may never revolt or that a christian may never be found in violence most likely the american democracy could not have been constituted in the first place without the revolution and nowhere in the world has it been easy to overthrow colonialism without violence the conscience of bonhoeffer involved him in a conspiracy to assassinate the head of state in his countryadolf hitlerand both in his life and in his death jesus christ was not a stranger to violence at least this should suggest that there are different sorts of violence no attempt is made here at any exhaustive or definitive analysis of the ethics of violence but the history of american social protest teaches us that an important distinction exists between intentional deliberate tactical violence on one hand and unpremediated spontaneous sporadic violence on the other for example in the early part of the labor revolution especially in the s both those in protest and those defending the status quo engaged in willful violence as a means of pursuing their respective social aims for both sides violence became integral to strategy and was thought to be the necessary and effective way of achieving certain objectives the northern ghetto riots of the rep resent a very different kindofjviolence they havenot beertpremeditated acts but have incarnated a violence of despair they represent a spontaneous violence nobody planned or plotted these riots no one conspired beforehand no one calculated that such violence would gain anything for anybody they were not the work as the fbi itself has repeatedly confessedof professional agitators disgruntled beatniks adolescent hoodlums black supremists or communiststhough once the fires of revolt were ignited it would have been astonishing indeed if some attempts were not made to feed the flames it is also significant that up to now the violence of the ghetto riots has been internalized what happened took place inside the ghettos and did not represent a direct assault upon white society or white property or white people in this sense the riots have been a symbolic violence the day when the despair of ghettoized negro citizens turns into wrath will be the day that someone tries to blow up city hall or burn down a white department store or sabotage an urban rapid transit system that will be the day when the violence of despair is no longer internalized and confined inside the ghettos but becomes open insurrection against white society almost all the riotsso farhave been occasioned by comparatively trivial and superficially unrelated provocations the two exceptions are in chicago and new york in chicago in the summer of a negro woman was fatally injured by a fire truck being operated in a grossly negligent manner there was no driver for the rearladder apparatus in new york in the summer of a negro boy was shot and killed in the presence of scores of other school children by an offduty white policeman in circumstances which to say the very least were extremely ambiguous in both these cases there had been serious incidents human beings had been either mortally injured or killed in the other cases howeverin trenton new jersey springfield massachusetts in watts in los angelesthe occasions for riot were relatively inconsequential and in some cases actually innocuous in rochester new york for example a man and his wife evidently drunk were arguing with each other on the sidewalk and were properly arrested for disorderly conduct by the police in philadelphia there was an ordinary traffic violation and the arresting officer was a negro such common and apparently insignificant incidents were enough nevertheless to kindle into riot the accumulated and inherited passions frustrations hostilities grievances hurts and pains of an imprisoned people in other words these northern city riots are a most radical form of violence perhaps the most volatile there can be unpremeditated unpredictable without tactical goals undisciplined chaotic without focus or definite purpose a spontaneous combusion of fury that is the mood which now threatens to overwhelm the civil_rights movement despair is probably the most pathetic human response of all because it operates on the assumption that there is no honest hope of meaningful change how can we ask the negro to believe that their everyday lives are about to be transformed and that their fragile dreams will not again be shattered despair in the ghettos can no longer be appeased by promises and pronouncements about gradual improvements despair expresses the defeat of human expectations for society now that it has been unleashed it will not be easily or quickly distracted not even by war much less deterred or displaced the despair which spawns the violence of the american ghettos is nourished as much by the apathy of white society as by the abominable conditions of ghetto existence the despair of urban negro citizens is as profound as the apathy of white citizens is obstinate no more appropriate symbols of the apathy of the american white establishment exist than in the incumbent political administrations of the principal northern cities warned of impending trouble in watts in the spring of mayor yorty of los angeles refused assistance from federal trouble shooters which had been offered by representatives of the war on poverty mayor daley shortly before the first chicago riot in publicly boasted that there were no ghettos in chicago in boston a militant racist mrs louise hicks has fashioned a promising political career by her skillful manipulation of the apathy and latent racism of white parents thereby entrenching her personal power in the school committee and evidencing her availability for the mayoralty office equally typical was the response of mayor wagner of new york to the harlem riots of the summer of after that trouble had been ruthlessly suppressed by the police the mayor called a press conference at which he stated that the unrest in harlem had some connections with the conditions in which the people there lived from day to day he mentioned the decrepit ratinfested tenements the obsolete academically inferior schools the shortage of jobs the absence of equal opportunity he even suggested that something should be done at the end of his administration a year and a half later however nothing had been done categorically and literally nothing in this respect new york is not unique among the great cities of the nation but it represents the epitome of white apathy if the promises of white people are regarded by negro citizens as not only empty but perhaps calculated deceptions and if the white mayors and other public representatives are thought to be somewhat shrewd if not very subtle cynics more than any other single thing it is the complacency of white society and the city halls they still dominate which is responsible for the secret premise the hidden assumption the unstated commitment the unconscious sentiment of most earnest wellintentioned lawabiding churchgoing peaceloving moderate white citizens is that the circumstances of life within the black ghettos should be improved somehow but that the ghettoization of society will indefinitely remain most white citizens are as yet not pathological in their attitudes toward negroes they are not vulgar and vicious racists but they have been reared in an ethos of white supremacy for so long that ghettoization is assumed as normative they have the idea that the racial unrest in society is due to an insufficient degree of white paternalism not yet realizing that parternalism is itself a form of racism what most whites who are not militant racists envision when they hear the words integration or civil_rights is a time when a significant empirical betterment of places like harlem and woodlawn and watts will have been achieved they entertain images of black ghettos becoming decent and pleasant habitations what white moderates do not realize is that they themselves are ghettoized not only racially but physically in the places where they live and study and work and play and worship and also in their minds and mentalitiesand hence in their morality white moderates are still enamored with the possibility of a society in which there is equality but separation not understanding that equality is inherently incompatible with the radical division of society by race in the basic spheres of life and that it represents an inequality suffered on both sides of the racial barrier whites who fondly assume that negroes prefer to live with their own kind must face the fact that it will only be when negro citizens have free access to reside and work and study and vote and live wherever they please that such a proposition can be seriously tested what incites despair inside the black slums is manifestly the failure to remedy glaring inequities in housing education and employment part of the secret of such despair is found in the profound psychological emotional and moral insularity of white people who complacently assume that such places as harlemeven if somewhat improvedwill continue to be ghettos indeed the atrocities of white racists in the deep south are probably easier to bear than the recalcitrance and ingenuity of white paternalism in the urban north this accounts in part for the strong reaction within the negro community to the celebrated moynihan report which had been advanced as the basis for deliberations at the white house conference on civil_rights and was properly controverted by dr benjamin f payton now executive director commission on religion and race national council of churches the moynihan report prepared by daniel p moynihan while he was assistant secretary of labor argues that the legal barriers to the assimilation of negro citizens have been substantially removed but that the critical obstacle that remains to integration is the breakdown of the negro family structure ajid tjie emasculation of the american negro male such a position is not exactly untrue but it is terribly incomplete and misleading unless placed alongside other important factors the moynihan report uncritically assumes that the inherited white family institution and the patterns of assimilation appreciable to white immigrants are the criteria of social stability which should and can overcome the disintegration of negro family life without acknowledging inherent strengths in the negro family though moynihan himself is obviously no racist and is a strong advocate of an immediate policy of total employment his report inadvertently furnishes a subtle rationale for the continuance of white paternalism it represents a halftruth because it fails to take note of the decadence of the american white family as it may casually relate to the plight of the american negro family or as an appropriate standard for a socially mature family structure as such of course if a moynihantype report were writtenas it well could beon the parallel breakdown in the white family structure in america and its accompanying defeminization of the white female it is unlikely that the white house would convene a national conference but in any case the racial ghettoization of society will only be more cruelly entrenched by any efforts to make negro families into facsimile white families what is needed to absolve despair is the determination that there be an end to ghettos every ghetto blights every city and town in this land with a negro population must be erased only by beginning with that commitmentand there are few signs that white citizens are even contemplating such a commitmentis there a serious possibility of conceiving and executing public policies which can at once free the prisoners of the black ghettos and emancipate white americans from the ghetto of their own complacency the ghettos must go both white and black must be freed from their imprisonments but what does that imply in terms of concrete public policies while i have no panaceas the most significant change would be a conversion in the mentalities of both white and negro citizens as for a black ghetto like harlem it is now so congested so deteriorated and so insufferable as to be mostly beyond rehabilitationa place unfit for human habitation but to destroy the harlem ghetto rather than futilely to patch it up would mean that the existing population of harlem would have to be dispersed and relocated elsewhere in the city and more than likely in the suburbs in localities where from the outset of the dispersion there would have to be integrated housing education and employment opportunities legitimate questions could be asked of course about whether society has the right to uproot people from where they now live and relocate them somewhere else but it seems that this is the practical reality wherever citizens are consigned to places like harlem no doubt white neighborhoods and schools and businesses in communities where dispersed negroes would find many patterns of society threatened or changed in such a process but the answer to that is that the bourgeois white ghettos must also be erased if this is to be integratedor simply a human society perhaps dispersion is not an appropriate remedy but it is an imaginable step and one that could be undertaken in fact it is the sort of policy that might well be considered if the moral commitment of this society became one of abolishing the ghettos instead of merely at best preserving and improving them the important thing is that integration means the disruption and rejection of much that has been taken for granted for many generations in americaa drastic reappraisal of values which has not yet been even theoretically contemplated while i mean to furnish no comfort whatever to the pathological racist among white americansto those of the ku klux klan or the john birch society or others whose reason has been pervertedlet it be nevertheless confessed that there is no serious ethical distinction between such racism and the more benign and more secretive white supremacy so common among the great multitudes of moderate middleclass whites no doubt there are aesthetic differences a mayor daley or a mayor yorty is not as vulgar a person as a bull connor or a governor wallace on the other hand a wallace seems far more candid than a yorty of course there is an aesthetic difference between those who have bombed negro churches in the black belt or those who have shot at civil_rights workers and those whose dividend income is gained in fact if not intentionally from speculation in slum real estate or investment in enterprises which practice de facto discrimination in hiring advertising customer services and the like but the differenceat least in new testament termsis one of aesthetics not ethics the massive indifference of the ordinary white citizen of good intentions is the moral equivalent of the perfidy of the white racists the profound apathy of the white moderates is ethically tantamount to the radical impudence of the white racists that the difference between the pathological racists and the socalled moderates in either north or south is a matter of aesthetic distinction rather than ethical significance can be documented in all too many ways in the colleges and universities of the north for all their venerable liberal traditions there is almost universally only token integration this has now been achieved even in most southern colleges and universities with a few exceptionsdartmouth is onethere is no significant evidence of any inclination to move beyond tokenism in higher education in either section of the country or to address the issue which realistically remains the chief barrier to admission of qualified negroes to college the cost of tuition and room and board despite all the dropouts among negro secondaryschool students there remain thousands of negro students qualified for college who do not goor even applybecause the costs of higher education are prohibitive other factors affect the collegiate admission of negro students too many with college potential are diverted early in their public education into vocational and commercial courses many are reluctant to attend overwhelmingly white schools and become exhibition negroes conventional recruitment and admissions procedures are often designed in a way which disadvantages the negro applicant because built into those interviewing and testing practices is the unarticulated assumption that the applicant will be a white middleclass type much as a female applicant for law school is at a disadvantage because admissions formalities are still geared to male applicantsyet in the face of the most urgent need for increased access to higher educational training for negroes one repeatedly encounters the pathetically unrealistic rationalization of professing white liberals that negro students already qualified for college entrance should be spared special preference in admissions lest they suffer reverse discrimination when in fact the effective barrier to their admission is simply lack of money there is also the gruesomely hypocritical matter of church investments where mission boards denominational institutions local congregations and parishes synodical and other regional authoritiesnot to mention legions of individual churchgoershave the audacity to utter praises to the name of christ whileagain with a bare sprinkling of exceptions profiting financially from a racism as evidenced by their endowment investments and by their current contracting hiring and spending policies as to that there is no important difference between the actual social witness on the side of racial segregation and discrimination among the churches and their related agencies in any part of the country or again the moral kinship between the moderate and the professed racist can be seen by comparing the political regimes which both support and the similarity in tactics with respect to the racial crisis practiced by those administrators both in the northern cities and in the southern hinterlands just consider those tactics as they have unfolded in the racial strife in both parts of the country separation in both north and south regimes depend upon the separation of society between the ghetto and the rest of the society in order both to nurture a mentality of acquiescence and a capacity to endure hardship among the ghetto residents on one hand and to supply the ignorance and prejudicial stereotypes of other citizens about the ghetto people on the other concealment in both there must be substantial concealment of the suffering and deprivation of negro citizens by keeping the actual conditions of ghetto existence out of the convenient sight of white citizens a necessity often met by the routing of traffic under over around but never through the blighted section toleration demonstrations for equal rights while undesirable must often be tolerated within the ghetto where sometimes they tend to relieve tension but seldom impress the people outside marches however outside the ghettos must if possible be stamped out suppression if violence does occur it must at all costs be localized within the ghetto and be suppressed by overwhelming force in the name of course of preserving law order and domestic tranquility rationalization when trouble does occur the authorities must be quick to locate a scapegoat in harlem hoodlums or drug addicts are always handy in alabama blame the communists and outside agitators they must be sure in applying this principle to repeat the scapegoat charges after the trouble subsides in order to impress the people outside and just as important in order to provide them with an excuse for any future violence proscrastination appease everybody by promising anything usually the ghetto people will be quiet for a while if a delegation is received at the executive mansion allowed to refer to grievances which in such a reception will be understated generalized and vague and solicited with a few indefinite assurances that whatever should be done will be done sometimes inviting the delegation to pose for news photographs ameliorates tension and abets evasion in case of emergency however keep promising to get to the bottom of things and to cure any legitimate ills or evils if pressed further though it is unlikely appoint a committee if truly desperate try to keep ones head and name a commission because it sounds more important and impartial of prominent citizens to investigate an investigation has an automatic virtually magical effect since people still suppose that investigation is a synonym for decisive action distraction the maneuver is to be employed especially by mayors or governors in times of crisis attention can be preempted for example by staging a parade for astronauts or by denouncing air pollution or engaging in harmless controversy with a politician in the other party tactics such as theseall too common in both north and south cater to white apathy and thereby show contempt for the selfinterest of those who are white and prosperous as much as for the rights of those who are black and poor perhaps only a psychiatrist could fathom the meaning of white apathy in the racial crisis to me however the most significant single factor in the present situation as ghetto violence embodies the profound despair of negro people is that the apathy of the great majority of white citizens may itself be a parallel form of despair realism enlightened selfinterest human reasonall argue convincingly for the constructive involvement of white citizens in working the social changes required to banish poverty abolish the ghettos and rehabilitate the nation economically socially and politically as one society but apathy prevails the reason cannot be any lack of public information or absence of warning about the crisis it has been almost literally impossible during the past decade to read a newspaper or watch a newscast without gaining some awareness of the scope and ominous potentialities of the racial struggle no white citizen including those who still live in communities where there are no negro residents can plead ignorance to excuse noninvolvement perhaps white citizens have received some sort of mass inoculation perhaps in fact they have become so conscious of what is decadent in this society so sensitive to the magnitude of the racial crisis so aware of how many assumptions of white society are threatened so astute about the upheaval in their own existence that would be wrought by significant integration of american public life that they have become paralyzed so they read the news of demonstrations and see photographs of riots and hear the cries of the poor but can no longer understand any of these things allowing themselves to become victims of the repeated lies of the racists or despairing of finding anything they can do which would not risk their property their status or their very lives if they do not themselves become racists they remain mute pretend that the problem is somewhere else fasten onto ingenious rationalizations remind themselves that they are personally innocent of any offense toward black men or revert to the banalities of brotherhood observances no one escapes this debilitating fatigue in some form or other i know that i am sick and tired of the racial crisis god knows how negroes must feel but i as a white man am now almost overwhelmed with the feeling that i do not want to hear anything more about it or see anything more of it or do anything more in it i wish it could somehow be escaped or evaded or avoided there was another great crisis that this nation endured within my own recollection and about which i felt somewhat the same during the korean war i was in the military service though mercifully i was not stationed in korea or called into combat but nevertheless i vividly rememberas many others also mustan acute fatigue in which i did not want to hear or see or do anything more about that awful war i wanted it to somehow evaporate and make no more demands on me i am pretty sure that this sentiment which was fairly prevalent did not alleviate or abbreviate that war in any way on the contrary if anything it must have contributed to its aggravation and prolongation something similar is true now in the american racial crisis wish it would end without my being any longer or any more deeply involved i would rather escape from what now happens to this nation yet i am certain both in my mind and in my guts that this exhaustion will not hasten the resolutionmuch less reconciliationof the racial crisis it can only frustrate and compound iteveryone in the united states is now involved in the racial crisis if there ever was an option on this subject it has expired the only issue that remains is how one is involved obstinately stupidly irrationally or with concern intelligence and compassion on that matter let us at last face some simple truths the racial crisis is not a good cause in the sense of some conventional charity like cancer research or aid for victims of disaster let whites renounce the romanticism of good works and the preposterous condescension of socalled liberalism no white man is doing a favor for any negro citizen by now advocating the ordinary rights of citizenship for the american negro in if such involvement constitutes favor it is as much for the selfinterest of whites as for any negro citizen the negro revolution must be considered within the context of the ethics and traditions of american social revolution there is no great novelty to social revolution in america and if the present crisis is seen as part of this history an astonishing fact emerges all earlier revolts were characterized by the ethics and tactics of violence until the negro revolution with the possible exception of the woman suffrage movement the women were apparently nonviolent in their demonstrations in the streets considering the vast numbers of citizens involved in the present revolution and the depth of their provocation it is incredible thatso farthe negro revolution has been for so long dominated by the ethics and tactics of nonviolence the dimensions of the negro revolution are such that the very survival of the nation is at issue the life and livelihood of every citizen is at stake however damaging it may be morally and psychologically the united states can probably survive even while continuing to exclude the american indian from the mainstream of its political and economic life politically and economically the exile from american society of the indian is hardly noticed but the denial to twentytwo million negro citizens of decent housing educational opportunity gainful employment political responsibility and free access to public accommodations is bound to threaten the survival of the nation for everybody the exclusion of that many citizens from society jeopardizes the political freedom economic solvency psychological stability and moral integrity of those who are not excluded just as much as those who are white people must finally wake up to the fact that their own welfare is quite as much at issue as that of the negro at least let profound selfinterest in the nations survival finally end the paternalism of white men for black men in these united states civil disobedience is not uncommon among americans there are probably very few citizens who have not in one way or another indulged in acts of civil disobedienceespecially in realms of the law concerning taxes traffic liquor sales and consumption gambling and sex the laws of some jurisdictions invite disobedience by evasionas in the case of new york states divorce laws all citizens need to remember as we observe daytoday developments in the racial crisis how widespread civil disobedience really is of course there are different forms of civil disobedience until the riots the civil disobedience characteristic of the negro revolution for the most part has been such that those who have disobeyed state and local lawsagainst which they were protestinghave willingly borne the consequences of their disobedience they have submitted to arrest endured prosecution served jail sentences and paid fines even in their disobedience they have upheld the rule of law the other form of civil disobedience opposes and denounces the rule of law as such and is not only a disobedience to existing law but an attempt to overthrow the rule of law by taking the law into ones own hands this is the civil disobedience of the lynch mob the assassin the birmingham bomber this is the civil disobedience that so far has been maily practiced in the racial crisis by whitesespecially in the south but not only thereand to which all too often the police authorities themselves have been privy the negro revolution is the eye of the hurricane but it is not the whole storm it is the most intense focus of contemporary social crisis but that crisis involves many other citizens all those who are poor all those who are sick and uncared for all those who are old and unwanted all those who are young and neglected all those whose skill and labor are made obsolete by automationall those in other words who have either been cast off or outcast in americaall those for whom the promises of freedom and humanity and society remain unredeemed in america in the twentieth century that the crisis is acutely dramatized in the situation of the negro citizen does not mean that if there were no negroes in america or if the negroes continued to acquiesce in their own humiliation and oppres sion this nation would escape the reformation that history now forces upon it the truth is rather that american negroes have become the authentic pioneers of a reconstruction of american society sorely even pathetically needed by all americans and of which we will all be beneficiaries should it come to pass but will it come to pass that is ominously doubtful it is now about twelve years since the negro revolution broke into the headlines and has evidenced organization and direction there have been all these years of peaceful protest sitins and freedom rides and picketing and prayer vigils and marches in that time thousands of citizens have been arrested thousands have lost their jobs thousands have suffered shame and humiliation in the churches in schools in the courts in hotels and parks and other public places even in their own homes in the pursuit of their rights as citizens the question which now plagues the civil_rights movement is whether the ethics and tactics of nonviolence have been vindicated in results it is a very american a very pragmatic question which now overtakes the negro revolution what does the american negro citizen have to show for these long years of unparalleled dignity and humanity and restraint in the south they have to show the decomposed remains of those sixtyone human beings some negroes some whites who sought to help citizens there to register to vote or who joined in peaceful demonstrations and protests and who were murdered for it and whose murderers have gone free hundreds of citizens can show you the scars on their bodies where they have been branded by cattle prods or bruised by police clubs or bitten by dogs in one sixmonth period in one southern jurisdiction alone more than forty churches and homes were bombed and burned and like the homicides this terrorism remains unpunished if that furnishes a macabre consolation to any northern citizens it need notnot any moreafter one counts the homicides committed by the police during the northern ghetto riots and the multiple indignities which ghetto citizens endure in the north every day in both parts of the country it is true there is now token integration in some schools and in most colleges and universities but tokenism is all it is almost anywhere meanwhile the churches remain steadfastly segregated with but rare exceptions and the unions have been far slower to desegregate than many businesses the congressional legislation of and the civil_rights act and the voting rights billhave been the two most tangible results of the pressures of peaceful protest the former was at least responsive to the march on washington the latter to the selmamontgomery march yet the impact of both of these measures as necessary as each was and as significant as both are has been chiefly localized in the south there even before the public accommodations section in many cities white businessmen had acknowledged the breakdown of segregation as an economic institution and had voluntarily opened their shops and restaurants and hotels to negroes though comparatively few southern negroes can afford to patronize them regularly in the northern jurisdictions local legislation had long since pretty much covered the scope of the new federal laws and the patterns of de facto segregation had long since been established thus the new federal acts have had little practical impact when therefore the pragmatic question is askedhave the tactics of nonviolence yielded significant restiltsthe truthful answer must be much more so in the south than in the north but only at afl eoimous cost in death and human suffering and nonviolence has not produced generally changes in the practical daytoday lives and livelihoods of the ordinary negro citizens of the land while only that sort of change can possibly vindicate the nonviolent leadership in the civil_rights movement thus the negro revolution has been plunged into a profound tactical crisis marches and sitins have never been as effective tactically in the north as they have been in the south and when other forms of peaceful protestlike the school boycotts advocating the bussing of students to achieve integration and quality educationhave been attempted in the north they have met with massive opposition from the incumbent political authorities and school boards as well as from white parents and teachers white intransigence has frustrated most forms of peaceful protest in the north and has in fact served to discredit nonviolence as a viable means of social protest meanwhile as the vietnam war has expanded and the demonstrations against that war have become more numerous and frequent many civil_rights advocates committed to nonviolence are bewildered as to what can be done tactically because they see that the antiwar movement has elicited such a wide public hostility to peaceful demonstrations about anything in this same period too the despair of ghetto residents has erupted in violence these pressures make it most difficult to maintain a nonviolence strategy in the tactics and ethics of the negro revolution the kind of social change which has impact upon the practical lives of the multitudes of negro citizens has not been launched by these years of peaceful protest nor is there much evidence it has even entered the minds of most white citizens thus the spirit of revenge is loose to prey upon the frustration and despair which american negroes have inherited from three centuries of slavery and segregation the mood becomes more militant and aggressive and explosive as each moment passes there is the passionate conviction that it is better not to live than to be a negro in the united statesnorth or southso what is to be lost by turning to violent assault upon white society and white property and white people many of the stereotypes still prevailing about negroes in this country can be traced through books of various kinds written from the middle of the th century to the beginning of the civil war this proslavery antinegro writing made its impact in spite of the mass of literature written against slavery one can only say that it is unfortunate that through books the peculiar institution of slavery was strengthened the writers of these books were just as much a part of the conspiracy as the slave holders although the term slave was not applied to the negro in the early decades of the settlement of this nation the fact remains that the colonists looked upon the negro servant slave and even free man as inferiors oscar handlin documents the fact that although slavery was not legally fixed until around the institution of slavery nevertheless was in existence and in looking at the literature of colonial america one will find it explicit colonial writers viewed negroes as inferior and different many of them said yes inculcate piety so as to save the black mans soul but remember he will never be equal cotton mather that great new england puritan certainly wanted to christianize the negro but ironically he nevertheless assumed the negros incapacity for freedom john woolman the quaker minister in an antislavery pamphlet stated the blacks seem far from being kinfolk and they are of vile stock yet woolman was a champion of converting and manumitting negroes he offered an ingenious defense of converting slaves conversion would serve as a measure of control thomas paine and thomas jefferson demonstrated their thoughts on the subject of the equality of black men in their writings perhaps jeffersons philosophy is the most glaring incongruity of all when comparing the slave in this country with the roman slave in his notes on virginia he stated that among the romans emancipation required but one effort the slave when made free might mix without straining the blood of the master but with us a second is necessary unknown to history when freed he is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture jefferson went on to prove his point about the distinctions between black and white men by concluding that nature not slavery produced the distinctions he injected a pseudobiological basis into the argument when he stated besides those of color figure and hair there are other physical distinctions proving differences of race they blacks have less hair on the face and body they secrete less by the kidneys and more by the glands of the skin which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odor jefferson like woolman advocated manumission of the slaves but also in the same breath he suggested returning them to africa for this manumission this ambiguous attitude towards negroes was in fact the basis of condescension among so called colonial liberals and even much later the separate but equal theory negroes know so well today there were those writers who felt the racial barrier had to be strengthened in the colonies particularly since slaves were learning to speak english and were becoming christians which of course was a threat of cultural assimilation some wrote popular tracts which were widely read on the negro being inferior because of his life in africa which inferred the worship of snakes and exotic objects this theme of the negros inferiority and godlessness persisted in books as late as charles carrols notorious the negro a beast or in the image of god which was published in during the last decades of the th century americans began to write novels as would be expected the first novels were heavily influenced by the novelists of england and had little concern for the realities of life in this country whenever a negro character appeared he was a shadowy figure looming in the background only a few writers attempted to attack slavery in their novels and unfortunately their works were not read widely in the north and certainly much less if at all in the south after and prior to the civil war there were those writers who included negro characters but described them as the mammy with the bright varicolored turban spotless apron and eversmiling face the uncle and the banjoplaying minstrel of the plantation slavery was depicted as benevolent and necessary for a childlike peoples transition from savagery to christianity these writers were convinced that the brutality of slavery existed only in the minds of fanatical yankees because the southerner was of a gentler breed sterling brown stated it accurately when he said that the writers of the plantation tradition felt that the grownup slaves were contented the pickinnies were frolicking the steamboat was hooting around the bend god was in heaven and all was right with the world the proslavery writers had as their model j p kennedys novel swallow barn a poorly written work which could be classed as a modest best seller of that day kennedy depicts negroes as clowns essentially parasitical and happy as long as the meddling abolitionists left them alone it is interesting to note that many of the kennedytype novels were written by women one northern woman writer married to a southerner celebrated the mammy she had her leading character comment to her husband oh my husband i never dreamed that slavery could present an aspect so tender and affectionate in this work the husbands slaves are shown as fat sleek and full of laughter on sunday at church they are attired in the latest fashions another writer a mrs eastman wrote a bestseller that was popular among the women on the pantation entitled aunt phyliss cabin the book glorifies slavery and denounces abolitionists all of this of course for the slaves welfare one observer of the women writers of the plantation tradition noted that they were too kind to mistreat slaves but nevertheless tarred and feathered and even lynched their characters who were abolitionists indeed a study of the proslavery women writers of that day would be very revealing harriet beecher stowes uncle toms cabin created a mild sensation when it appeared in the three years that followed miss stowes publication there were at least novels published to counteract it w l g smiths life in the south or uncle toms cabin as it is is typical of the antistowe novels which appeared in smiths parody uncle tom is urged to run off to canada by abolitionists upon reaching canada he is placed in slavery again he begs his master to return him to the south which was done out of christian consideration it is inaccurate to suggest that all white authors wrote in an attempt to dehumanize the negro we did have such writers as washington irving and herman melville to name a few irving was a young brisk manabouttown and he recorded his curiosity about the negro in knickerbocker history of new york there is the negro character caesar who perhaps is the first comic negro in american fiction however he is comic in strictly a human sense and crafty and quickwitted as well herman melville has his character pip in moby dick characterized as a coward not because he is black but because he is naturally human in benito cereno we see the noble slave babo plan a revolt aboard a slave ship off the coast of chile babo is shown as a hero and a natural leader other slaves are shown as men willing to fight for their freedom they revolted as mankind has always revolted when subjugated james fenimore cooper has a negro character in the spy who is courageous and in the pioneers he characterizes abraham as a robust free black man who actively takes part in the life of the frontier in his last of the mohicans cora the negro woman is shown as a strong and resourceful character it should be mentioned that prior to the civil war the first novel by a negro was published william wells brown wrote clotei or the presidents daughter browns work was followed by frank webbs the garies and their friends and martin delaney followed webbs work several years later with blake or the huts of america these three novels are noteworthy because they were written by black men at a time when whites were saying that negroes were incapable of learning and in the words of jefferson are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind as can be seen then there were writers prior to who were sympathetic towards the negro and his condition but there were too many writers who were in favor of slavery and who never became convinced that the negro was an equal american literature reveals that these early writers exerted all of their energies in perpetuating the peculiar institution through books wherein the civil war was fought and the slaves emancipated the antinegro books made so great an impact that we are still faced with the consequences of their prejudices which were passed on through the printed word and this too could have y y been a paean but cons y r tradictions abound in our history and there are historical discontinuities fortunately we are constantly inevitably moved moved by the haunting memory of minutes measured in drops of pawned manhood or by the centuriesold whip like a mule desperate bobbingandweaving uphill on this slippery road possessed with frenzied rhythms of passionate desire to grasp this historical moment and redefine man in order to keep moving with clarity so now i want to talk about somebody most of us are familiar with the young selfavowed black revolutionary artist and intellectual he says he has read marx engels lenin guevara mao nkrumah du bois frantz fanon he says he has looked into negritude and though he was somewhat moved and sympathetic he came back with a frown he likes leroi jones plays because they run the crap down like it really is this young man knows about the nature of revolutions and counterrevolutions the world over and is never hesitant to express his hostility to the western world he is so disillusioned with western values he claims that he will never ever trade in his retrieved soul rhythmic reasoning for the western analytic sensibility the upholders and defenders of western christian civilization kill lumumba and his heart bleeds the upholders and defenders of western christian democratic ideals put kaunda kenyatta sobukwe mandela and countless others in jail and his heart bleeds the upholders and defenders of western christian morality kill millions of people in vietnam latin america africa and america and his heart bleeds he probably wishes he had builtin bombs to mow down all these devils that shows a lot of potential but potential which remains potential does not help alleviate or solve anybodys problems potential has to grow and the fruits of that potential have to be realizable in very concrete terms as a way of life hence my accusation i accuse the selfavowed young revolutionary artist and intellectual of negligence or irresponsibility should i say it might even be downright cowardice let me point out here that in ioparticular i am talking about the young afroamerican and the young south african artist and intellectual for a number of reasons in most cases artists from colonial countries have grown up in a notsohighly industrialized urban society the south african and the afroamerican are from highly industrialized societies run by racist capitalist exploiters and judeochristian ethics at all stages of his training right from kindergarten on up the values of the colonized were are systematically destroyed by the oppressor the young colonial subject is trained to look down upon everything that is his he is trained to aspire to the colonialists ideals and to emulate the oppressor his heroes artistic and historical are colonialist the success of the colonialists damaging of our minds is reflected for instance when a young colonial subject watches an american cowboy movie he finds himself without knowing why identifying positively with the white plunderer he even sees the indian who is fighting in defense of his person and his land as the villain by the time he is through the masters college he is so whitewashed and westernoriented he might as well have had a grecoroman ancestry but as much of european culture as he assimilates he finds himself still a nigger in the eyes of the oppressor exceptional maybe or different but still a nigger to the oppressor this frustrates him and he begs the oppressor to accept him for he is ashamed to go back to his people because he looks down upon them the african in what the oppressor calls the underdeveloped countrymeaning that his country is not western christian industrialized that the people there do not worship the dollar the pound or the franc and the bombdoes not have our hangups he has never mistaken himself for a carboncopy noball whiteman his identity has never been questionable thus what we are faced with demands more discipline more tearing apart of the rot in our minds and very conscious planning the oppressor is not going to say all right fm sorry i was so inhuman when we decide we have had enough of his nonsense he will be more repressive and he will kill us any time we say his game is over anybody who thinks the oppressor will take his hold off our throats when we say it hurts lives under a criminal illusion first the oppressor throws christ and that gloryafterdeath bull on you when that ceases to work he throws money on you or a separate development plan or a civil_rights bill and selects your leaders for you he will pass laws to proscribe whatever you attempt to do if it is not in line with what he prescribes when that fails he throws a bomb on you ask the vietnamese people or any people involved in national liberation wars it is at this point that history calls upon us to try the best we can to fulfill our mission we owe it to the generations that will come after us we owe it to the dead of sharpeville watts and the harlems around the world we owe it to malcolm fanon and the rest of suffering humanity it is at this point that we must clearly realize that our problems are not going to be solved in conference rooms the fight is going to be bloody and our art if it is valid is going to be carved from that portion of history it is going to reflect explore and celebrate the nature of that blood condemnation alone spills no liberatory blood at best condemnation without action remains a tensionreleasing mechanism but people trained under fascist savagery to be so afraid settle for the least bit of comfort but that fear too like all western references must bleed to death all these years our passion and desires have been lying dormant like animals in hibernation or like leafless trees between the winter and the summer not dried up and dead but alive and waiting for the spring to blossom our spring has been here too long and im afraid imperialist floods might ruin us before we bear fruit if we linger here too long but still terror reigns in the mind we are so full of fear where is the decolonized mind many of us realize that the attempt to establish a collective expression of a constructive revolutionary program a pulling together of our heads to work out a new system of values and an unconditional assertion of those valuesnational and international in scopecalls for discipline and responsibility of duty we are afraid to shoulder this responsibility as a result we do not even totally reject the oppressors values we rationalize we become dishonest we are never hesitant to proclaim our identification with the people but our identification remains strictly theoretical because there are no acts to give our statements substance we make an art and claim it is the peoples art but that is questionable it seems as paternalistic a gesture as that of the white liberal the liberal never hesitant to make statements about how justifiable our fight against racist domination is is not willing to fight by any means necessary against oppression and i am afraid the attitude of some people who claim to be black artists is similar to that of the liberal recently i asked a group of colleagues if they believed most of our art was truly with the people theres a thing like selling black you know and it seems like its a commodity very much in demand in liberal circles one of them replied man dont be so naive you still think them niggers is worth dying for please note that this attitude is not representative but it exists among people who write what they never hesitate to call black poetry then there are those who do not do much more than talk about or quote marx if that is one of the best things we can do for our liberation we are in bad shape look i do not have anything against marx in fact i like him he is one of the few europeans who tried to make the white sensibility human for those selfstyled nationalists who are as antisocialist as the oppressor let me point out here that there is a difference between socialist political and economic theory and the historical sellingout of known communistsi mean cardcarrying ones every nation in the world today which rejects western racist ideologies operates from a socialist economic and political base what we have to clearly realize though is that for the solution of our problems conventional marxism is inadequate we do not have a class problem this does not mean that there is no black bourgeoisie but they do not have any kind of power in decisionmaking bodies which have shoved us where we are they are insignificant toolsshowcase stooges for the oppressor to use in defense of his sinister ways if we had a purely class problem if poverty was the major problem to be solved in a rich country like america or south africa the poor regardless of color or race would necessarily have been reasonably united and fighting together to eliminate poverty but our problem is both economic and racial at the same time and these two are so intertwined that we do not know which one is really the cause of the other and it does not matter what is abundantly clear is that we are colonized and exploited by white peopleall of them western christian racist and even the white worker a little pawn without imagination benefits from this thus class exploitation is not similar to racial domination and exploitation and marx developed theories and strategy to guide and attempt to humanize precapitalist europe but even he did not spend all his time theorizing his peoples problems he was not afraid he was out there organizing and mobilizing those forces to get the revolution off the ground where is our program of action the salvation of the world we now clearly know lies in the destruction of the power of the western world it lies in the establishment of a system of values hostile to any manner of exploitation oppression and the domination of one race by another race or one nation by another nation this calls for an understanding of the world we live in and a clear vision of the world we want to construct this calls for collective planning our lack of planning programs of action and establishing revolutionary social institutions renders us weak as a group and i say lumumba got killed because of our collective weakness mandela and sobukwe and thousands of others are in jails immobilized because of our collective weakness brother malcolm was assassinated at the beginning of his revolutionary maturity because of our collective weakness countless other perverted atrocities are continually perpetrated on us because of our collective weakness brothers what i am driving at is for instance the following if our historical enemynow practically our natural enemyhad known that should anything have happened to brother malcolm_x there would have been chaos in harlem that night that the following day there wouldnt have been a single whiteowned store on th street that the very foundations of this system would have had to cope with a black uncontrollable power the chances are that brother malcolm would still be with us i do not accuse the group of wanting to be ownedeven remotely psychologicallyby imperialist forces i believe that we would rather die than be weak and enslaved in whatever form modernday slavery is practiced i believe that we want to live in a world with a new order of things a new image of man loving love loving life feeling and really living instead of being perverted with material values i believe that we all no longer want any stupid iffy concessions from liberals who are essentially in sympathyand collaboratewith the forces we want to destroy for the survival of humanity we know the aspirations and the needs of the people because if we are not just maladjusted western artists with black faces mere carboncopy whitemen our consciousness and collective conscience find direction from the throbbing of the peoples collective heart of course the people are not always right hence the absolute necessity for institutions that would guide the development of their values if we have this consciousness and we are moved by our conscience as men in search of a new order of things we will realize that the frustrated opportunistic dishonest white lefts anticapitalist whimpering is not our problem i believe it is time for us to stop and check ourselves out thoroughly and as leroi jones said you might surprise yourself right out the window we are preoccupied if we are sincere not necessarily with the atrocities of the western world but with turning the world into a better place for human habitation we feel and think as we do only because we now believe that we are inherently more interested in humanity than in the material values of the white western world this does not mean that we have not killed men and raped women but our historical experience is such that since we came into contact with the white sensibility the concentration of our efforts our attempt as a race to live has boiled down to means of survival however right now we are not concerned with what we might have been but with what we will be we clearly understand that we are at war we have always been at waronly for so long we pretended that we did not clearly realize we were now we clearly realize also that whether we fight back or not the enemy continues to molest us there are some mature artists and intellectuals around unfortunately their growth is mainly personal virtually divorced from the masses of the people though forever given momentum by the peoples collective desire for liberation in this aspect of our development our acts the constant broadening of our consciousness of the world we live in our psychological liberation have been mainly personal because we have not developed a body of thought an ideology to determine our collective behavior a firm uncompromising stand as a liberatory vehicle the people must know what is going on and what can be done this means we should be prepared to analyze situations and help to clarify the peoples vision when johnson comes out and threatens remember theres only ten per cent of you we must clarify the implications of that move to the people a speech at a rally or an article in a magazine will not do this we have to establish institutions which will facilitate the political education of the people where our strategies can be mapped out and then there is the crucial question of symbols the symbols that the majority of the people relate to have been created by the oppressor to ensure our psychological captivity we must create more relevant symbols that the peoples development of a system bols that will intensify the peoples determination to be free politically economically and psychologically symbols that will facilitate the peoples development of a system of thought which will enable them to readily see through the oppressors strategies so that we will not be caught offguard again as it so damned frequently happens our awareness of where we are historically demands this responsibility of us finally i think our method at this historical moment as a group is bankrupt our literature and the arts i believe should be the solid coil around our collective desire and method make no mistake there is some beautiful poetry around some beautiful music and the rest of the arts too but the people do not know this the people do not read they are too busy at the grind trying to make it perhaps even if they read at this stage of our development they would not recognize the beauty because of the symbols they have been trained to relate to and poetry is not enough it is not and has never been because of a lack of poetry song or dance that we are in our present condition somewhere tucked away in the recesses of my being is a hazy e memory as time has passedi have occa sionally reflected on this reminiscence and wonder whether it is a dream or an altered childhood fanft tasy with all of us the passage of time makes dreams fantasy and reality blur and mix so that our memories are a coalescence of what was what we longed for and what we were afraid of i recall a time when i was approximately nine our minister announcing that at the end of the service the next week a mr rasmussen would have a few words to say ours was the colored methodist episcopal church in los angeles in later years to further an identity search and discard an outmoded image the church changed its name to christian methodist episcopal following the announcement by our pastor there was a general buzzing in the church i became aware that mr rasmussen was white and heard mutterings that it was election time in keeping with the practices then current he was expected to give an innocuous talk and the adults in the congregation were subsequently expected to go out and vote for him except in rare circumstances no one in the church would see him again until his next political campaign our visitor would stay for just a few minutes and then visit other branches of the church in south los angeles south los angeles was an euphumism for watts which even then was the last district on the agenda of any politician in those days and i imagine even now all the children sat in the balcony or loft of the church there we could sleep pass notes and from our lofty perch make judgments on the presumed sinners in the congregation below i still cringe as i recall the minister stopping in midsermon to admonish the children to be quiet for us the voice of god himself could not have been more frightening or commanding after the announcement of mr rasmussens forthcoming visit i vaguely hoped he would not come i was uncomfortable at the thought of his observing our congregation if our pastor was in good form there was a possibility that sister tyler would get happy or that someone might get carried away with amens sister tyler was our barometer indicating whether a sermon really swung or not on some sundays the large dark lady sang vigorous solos she was resplendent in her robe and her mobile face and body conveyed her mood as much as her voice she was able to control the congregation in accompanying any speaker often punctuating the preachers message with short replies if he began to really move she served as a catalyst for the entire congre gation to pour out their feelings and shout while we could get happy among ourselves i was uncomfortably aware even at that age that we could never let white people observe us carrying on the next week was one of tremendous excitement and anticipation for me several times i went to bed and drifted off to sleep only to be awakened by a nightmare in which sister tyler had indeed gotten happy jumped up and yelled and fallen prostrate to the floor as in the past the ushers came up with their fans and placed magic potions under her nose but this time the good sister continued her assault on the devil by jumping up and starting the whole sequence over again i could never reconcile the ambivalence of getting happy in church with being joyful in that there was always much crying handclapping and body writhing accompanying the former my mother once spent all of a summer talking me out of a youthful concept that when sister tyler got happy she was really quite angry the nightmares continued all week long until sunday arrived i could hardly wait for sunday school to end so the service could proceed we had the various offerings and songs followed by the sermon mr rasmussen was to appear at the end of the service our minister seemed particularly slow that day dragging the service on and on by the time mr rasmussen actually appeared my dreadful anticipations had left me so emotionally spent that i heard only a small part of his very brief speech he came in through a side door and immediately began to vigorously shake the hand of our pastor after the introduction he began to talk in a low voice and kept referring to himself as your friend occasionally his head would nod back and forth and i vividly recall seeing a single white face silhouetted in front of the choir while the details of that face have long since fled my memory many of the feelings experienced during that day have remained from a seat in the balcony i had gotten upstairs early to be assured of a front row i looked down at the congregation sister tyler was serene and relaxed with a masklike face influenced by her the other ladies were also sitting quietly the only overt signs of any feelings were occasional nods of the head more perfunctory and habitual than anything else i have often reflected on my week of painful expectation mr rasmussen came and spoke and left for watts i wondered what he did when he was not making speeches did he have any children did they go to church i felt he did not know us and we did not know him the minister had not sounded like himself when he introduced the guest no one had gotten happy all of us had held back and i perceived that mr rasmussen had also held back i wondered if he would make the same speech in watts and if he would know the people there any better or if they would know him something had been missing in us when mr rasmussen came and i felt sure something had been missing in him also we did not know ourselves in the presence of each other at first this realization was one of relief later it was pain i one of the most significant and disturbing problems of contemporary america is the continuing and as yet unsuccessful effort to delineate a national identity in our sloganeering culture this effort has been characterized as a quest for identity writers discussing this search have had many and at times conflicting views but the concept of identity itself has remained an important one identity now appears as a central idea among people of the modern world from peoples all over the globe the word is heard to describe the highest ambitions of men in some unifying manner the patriot in africa the slum dweller in rio de janeiro and many people in this country all appear to be making the same appeals new national entities such as kenya and established ones such as france all use the term to exhort their people to more eloquent heights erik erikson the foremost student of identity defines the term simply an identity provides the ability to experience oneself as something that has continuity and sameness and to act accordingly he was the first social scientist to relate man to an environment that was both internal and external only after the contributions of erikson did we begin to take into account how a mans caste and class influenced so totally his thoughts about himself a healthy identity encompasses basic thoughts that one has about his body and sex parental love and admonitions which have been effectively assimilated an important aspect of a viable identity is the capacity to perceive oneself as something having a past present and future in short a personal historical sense this is seldom conscious but more a subtle awareness that one has alternatives and can make choices the familiar adolescent crisis is our most visible example of an individual groping for identity as adolescents make the transition from dependence and reliance on others to independence and selfsufficiency there can be many outward evidences of change some of these are delicate and barely noticed and some are explosive and frenzied for an individual to achieve completeness and the ability to give and receive mature love then many basic questions surrounding identity must be resolved contrary to popular misconception these are rarely if ever accomplished by asking who am i outside the offices of psychiatrists or the imaginations of philosophers few people ask themselves this question they may unknowingly pursue an identity adopting or discarding several but the question is invariably asked inwardly the question manifests itself with patterns of thought or by feelings and behavior but seldom by open conscious questions another important consideration is that an individual is never without an identity it may be hated devalued and despised but it is present nevertheless in this context the negro in this country has always had an identity namely that of an anomalous black man in a white mans country one of his core problems remains the assimilation of his blackness into the white american identity he has been seen as a person of sorts but not as a whole man with a full range of choices of central importance here is the following concept where expression of ones identity has been denied one of the dangerous paths open is the seizure of identity through destructive action the article on a philip f ir randolph portrait of an afroamerican d radical by john henrik clarke ne gro digest march raises serious questions about the way our history is treated in the popular press although mr clarkes purpose in writing this piece was ostensibly to present a brief sketch of what went into the making of an afroamerican radical it so happens that radicals such as mr randolph do not make history solely according to the dictates of their own personal designs such leaders are also shaped molded and propelled by social forces outside of and beyond themselves hence it is impossible to get an understanding of a radical fortyodd years after his beginnings by telling only what he accomplished we have a right to also know some of his failures and at least a hint of what outside trends and forces during his career made for both his successes and his failures mr clarke failed to do this although he could very well have a philip randolph is one of the more outstanding leaders in the th century history of the american negro this is emphasized in order to separate the th from the th century this is done because the most serious weakness in the outlook of the negro civil_rights niques is blunted by racial realities in america the militants are in serious trouble they are forced to retrench behind slogans like black_power etc and to formulate new programs for action there is very little understanding here that as leaders and activists this new militant breed of the s is nothing but a conmovement in all its factions is that most of the new leaders and ideologists have very little understanding of the negro movements th century beginnings and the mixture of ingredients that went into those beginnings this ignorance of the th century is most glaring in the socalled militant nationalist black_power wing of the negro movement once the effectiveness of militant direct action tech tinuation or repetition of similar trends issues slogans and programs brought to life from to the s the very period which produced a man like a philip randolph our movements for freedom equality liberation emigration separation integration and even migration from one state to another section are th century movements they have only the most tenuous historical connections with th century trends of frederick douglass and others yet there is a persistent belief in articulate negro circles that our present day movements are traceable back to precivil war slavery emancipation reconstruction etc but this is true only in a historical romantic sense we honor a frederick douglass in this historical sense but all that douglass stood for and fought for in postcivil war reconstruction was washed away by southern bourbon restoration of the s and s douglass died in during the very decade when the united states became an openly aggres sively imperialist nation in its war against spain in cuba and the philippines when america became imperialistic in foreign policy the relationship of the negro to american society changed character and became something else not experienced by frederick douglass and the leaders of his heyday the negro was still committed to struggling for the same objectives as douglass had but under radically changed social economic political and cultural conditions it was for these reasons that the s and early s produced two entirely new leaders in the person of booker t washington and w e b du bois who came into mutual conflict over program in a way that douglass never had to experience with his own black contemporaries over slavery and emancipation thus the th century produced the movements the leaders the trends the ideas the conflicts which formed the historical and organizational beginnings to which our current movements are heirs from to we had washingtons tuskegee movement in we had du boiss niagara movement which helped establish the naacp in in the urban league was formed and a few years later began the greatest mass migration in american history of the negro out of the south into the north in the meantime the american socialist party had attracted a corps of negro intellectuals of whom a philip randolph was one of the most outstanding the messenger magazine which he edited along with chandler owen was a black socialist organ which grew out of the hotel messenger which randolph had founded in in the american communist movement was established following the russian revolution of as a result certain negro socialists associated with randolph on his messenger broke with the socialists to become communists randolph however remained a socialist and became an anticommunist thus there developed a bitter political feud between randolph and certain of his former socialist colleagues in the communist party which lasted from the s into the s and beyond a philip randolph emerged as a socialist leader just prior to the time marcus garvey established his nationalistic back to africa movement in harlem after having failed to set it up in jamaica british west indies there developed a bitter feud not only between randolphs messenger group and the garveyites but also a fight between the garveyites and the very same excolleagues of randolphs who had become communists there was also a violent polemical conflict between marcus garvey and du boiss naacp at the same time the young writers on randolphs messenger were criticizing w e b du bois as an old leader from the old school who no longer spoke for the new negro this was the same thing du bois had told booker t washington about years earlier when he revolted against booker ts conservative economic nationalism with the niagara movement what was going on here in the s negro movements it was a fateful clash between naacp civil_rightsism garvey nationalism negro socialism negro communism plus black trade unionism when randolph launched his brotherhood of sleeping car porters organizing drive in then to add to this wild conflict of black politics and economics came the provocative and as yet illunderstood question of cultural consciousness of the negro renaissance movement which produced langston hughes paul robeson claude mckay countee cullen etc and the jazz age the grass roots ferment underlying all of this provocative social ferment was the mass migration into new york of southern negroes and west indians the west indian character of the garvey movement spawned a clash between west indians and american negroes over group social values leadership priorities and accommodation to the ways of life in american northern cities the attacks on garveyism emanating from randolphs messenger and du boiss naacp took on an antiwest indian flavor and garvey saved his choicest blasts for du bois yet the facts are that behind the scenes garveys most effective enemies the ones who had him jailed were west indians all of these and more were the basic ingredients that went into the formation of the th century negro movement we know today and every single one of these issues are still with us only in a more complex and exaggerated form what we are dealing with in todays civil_rights movement are the unsolved problems not of the s but of the s it was against such a background that a philip randolph started the brotherhood of sleeping car porters but for mr clarke to merely cite the opposition of the pullman company against randolphs efforts is of little crucial importance today everybody knows that industry management was always antilabor whether white or black what is more important for us is an insight into randolphs personal socialist politics before he started organizing porters for example who were some of the other prominent negro socialists randolph was allied with why were they so critical of the politics of w e b du bois clarkes freedomways magazine is a very produ bois publication but in randolphs messenger said that du boiss conception of politics is strictly opportunist within the last six years he has been democrat socialist and republican he must said the messenger editorially make way for the new radicalism of the new negro during the same period several of randolphs socialist colleagues around the messenger broke with the socialist party and joined the newly formed communist party movement they became the pioneer negro communists of the s it is important for us to know why randolph refused to become a communist himseff while some of his friends did randolph always remained an anticommunist at least two of randolphs former s friends are still alive and one of them even writes for freedomways occasionally in view of the fact that w e b du bois finally joined the communist party in some years after it was formed and in view of the fact that freedomways is produ bois how can mr clarke as a freedomways editor call randolph a radical what was the precise difference between du boiss radicalism and randolphs radicalism the communists of the s looked with disfavor upon randolphs organizing of the pullman porters into a separate allblack union none of randolphs exnegro socialist friends who had become communists supported randolph in his efforts to organize the porters why did they take this attitude during the same periodrandolphs messenger said editorially that negro communists were a menace why did randolph believe this what about randolphs relationship with the garvey movement it is a fact that randolphs messenger writers were implacable enemies of the garvey movement in the messenger attacks on the garvey movement were so bitter that a w a domingo one of randolphs exfriends among the negro socialists wrote a letter of protest accusing the messenger of being antiwest indian domingo had quit the messenger as a staff writer because of randolphs handling of the garvey question domingo complained who are the bitterest enemies and most persistent opponents of garvey arent they west indians w a domingo was antigarvey randolph was antigarvey and the communists were antigarvey and garvey was particularly anticommunist but what was garveys attitude towards randolphs organizing of the pullman porters this question is no longer crucial for garveyism today since garveyism is no longer an important force however it is still important relative to the communists because the enmity between randolph and the communist party has been an everlasting fact mr clarke however must pass over many of these facts as if they were not important but they are not only must we review all these historical trendsgarvey nationalism black socialism black communism black trade unionism black civil_rightsism etcwe must also have some historical understanding of why all these factions were at each others political throats what were they really fighting over consider mr clarkes treatment of randolphs role in the organizing of the national negro congress clarke gives us a long quotation from randolphs speech at the founding convention of the nnc in which he optimistically accepted the presidency of the new organization but mr clarke has nothing to say about why randolph quit the nnc four years later he quit because the national negro congress very quickly came under the control of the communist party and randolph the radical did not go along with the communist takeover again randolph clashed with the communists as he had back in the s why this conflict according to one historian of this period randolph quit the national negro congress because the nnc was now nothing more than an enlarged communist party cell he knew that to continue in office would mean acceptance of a program which he could not endorse in principle he knew too that it would mean serving as a stooge for the party bureaucrats and their errand boy who now firmly held the reins of all the governing committees randolph stated his own reasons for quitting the presidency of the nnc in the new york times of april the national negro congress should be dependent on resources supplied by the negro people alone the grounds for my belief is that history shows that where you get your money you also get your ideas and control e franklin frazier writing of the national negro congress meeting of said the large attendance of whites in was the result it was reported of the influence of the communist party when one considers the diverse interests that were represented in the organizations officially affiliated with the national negro congress it is obvious that its unity and solidarity rested upon a precarious basis from the beginning these were some of the facts concerning randolph and the national negro congress thus for mr clarke to contend that the nnc was a forerunner of presentday civil_rights groups such as the congress of racial equality core and the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc is a gross distortion of historical fact core started in as an independent nonpolitical noncommunist affiliated civil_rights group while sncc started in the sixties as a studentyouth movement under youth leadership the nnc was certainly not a youth group how can a historian as experienced as clarke make such shallow and inaccurate comparisons the nnc was a product of the severe economic depression of the s plus the ciolabor organizing upsurge that distinguished this period it was a product of its times and had little in common with the issues of the s except civil_rights which has always been with us through the lean years and the fat lastly comes mr clarkes glowing account of randolphs role in organizing the famous move for his march on washington of the threat of this march caused president roosevelt to issue his renowned executive order establishing the presidents committee on fair employment practices committee fepc this order was effective in outlawing racial discrimination in war defense industries randolph then called off the intended march on the capital having achieved his aims but here again it is important to note that none other than the communist party randolphs antagonist since the s was in opposition to this march on washington in fact both the communist party and randolphs former organization the national negro congress were against randolphs march on washington movement the reasons for this opposition were too complicated to be analyzed here but they were based mainly on the communist partys enmity over randolphs undisputed influence in the negro community which the communists tried mightily to undermine the historian quoted earlier wrote some of the most vitriolic attacks ever leveled by the communist party at a negro organization were visited upon the march on washington during this period if it was mr clarkes intent to merely write a laudatory piece on a philip randolph as the dean of negro leaders that is his privilege yet clarke is a historian and more is demanded of a historian today mr clarke however succeeds in lifting randolph out of too much of the social context that is pertinent to our understanding of what made randolph what he is and was randolph as a leadership personality was molded by a great conflict of th centurytrends that emerged between and the s it was practically these trends which created the th century negro struggle in all its complexity the negro movement in all of its aspects we know today are nothing but a continuation of those early trends on another level anyone who does not understand these early trends cannot grasp what is wrong with the negro movement today the negro civil_rights movement is in a serious crisis now therefore it is necessary that the entire th century development of leadership trends must be researched analyzed and reevaluated from booker t washington to du bois to randolph to garvey to robeson to elijah muhammad down to malcolm_x and even adam clayton powell for without such a thorough going reevaluation and reinterpretation all such slogans as black_power remain empty talk this should be the objective of all history writing today especially about leaders oddly enough the editorial of mr clarkes freedomways magazine for fall supports the freedom budget another of randolphs achievements it says the freedom budget proposals have the support of all of the major organizations in the negro freedom movement although a philip randolph guided the preparation and publication of this budget freedomways does not mention him in the editorial we the members of the students afroamerip can society realize the need to comprehend more fully our perspective and our roles both as negroes and as members of the society in which we live we form this organization seeking to unite and utilize the resources and experiences of the students of columbia university in order that we may achieve a greater understanding of the complexity of racial problems in america thus states the preamble of the constitution of an organization which appears destined to play an important role in the future of the human rights struggle in the united states that organization is the students afroamerican society sas of columbia university this society of afroamerican students founded in by hilton clark son of the noted psychologist dr kenneth clark has one of the largest memberships of which are activeof several such societies which have sprung up on the ivy league campuses it is an example of a new much needed and muchwelcome trend of group identification which is developing among black students on prestigious ivy league campuses for many years and in most instances rightfully so black ivy leaguers have been accused of practicing a genteel uncle thomasism the chief purpose of which was to achieve individualistic material prosperity without a second thought to the wellbeing of their fellow afroamericans this tendency has severely hurt the overall progress of the human rights movement for it meant that afroamericans as a group were denied the benefit of skills that these highlytrained group members possessed with little if any group identification they felt no sense of group responsibility on december sas hosted the first intercollegiate conference of afroamerican students according to robert belt a senior government major at columbia college and current president of the columbia group the purpose of the conference was to examine the role afroamerican college students should play in the black revolution and their responsibility both individually and collectively to the civil_rights effort also according to mr belt the conference hoped to encourage the formation of afroamerican student societies at other universities and colleges and to lay the groundwork for the eventual federation of these groups into a nationwide association of afroamerican students among the schools represented at the conference were harvard yale princeton mt holyoke radcliffe barnard and vassar delegates also came from howard university and morehouse college speakers at the conference included james farmer former national director of the congress of racial equality core ivanhoe donaldson of the students nonviolent coordinating committee sncc roy innis president of harlem core floyd mckissick current president of national core and james meredith when asked by this writer to give their opinion as to the chief significance of the conference farmer replied that the chief significance is that at long last black students have overcome their fear of associating with other black students the students gathered here are wrestling with the major debates of the civil_rights movement and we need their minds in those debates innis said it gives me a chance to meet a good crosssection of the young black students and to sample their thinking this group is extremely important because like it or not they are future leaders and it is my job to try to influence them as much as possible in the interests of black people we have to compete with the enemy for their allegiance mckissick felt that it had brought afroamerican students together from all over the east this will benefit the cause of black_power and should hasten the end of uncle thomasism to meredith the very occurrence of the conference was the chief significance most meetings of black students have been for purely social purposes and the fact that they have met together for such serious purposes is the utmost importance donaldson of sncc told the students that it was important that they use the knowledge and skills gained in the prestigious universities not just for narrow individual attainment but as a means to help improve the nationwide and worldwide position of their group mckissick innis and donaldson also warned the students to beware of greeks bearing gifts they told them that the white power structure would expect payment for the honors scholarships and awards currently being bestowed upon them the payment of acting as a somewhat privileged buffer group between the white majority and the black masses the chief protection for the students against these notsosubtle attempts at seduction is a strong sense of group identification which will insure group loyalty the involvement of afroamerican student societies such as sas in the human rights movement indicates a new awareness among black students an awareness which should be supported by all elements of the black community the skills they are acquiring if put to the use of the total group can change the course of the movement and help to speed up the groups progress towards liberation afroamerican experts in such fields as history economics sociology journalism social science and politics should volunteer their services to the students the student movement if successful could eventually lead to an effective alliance between black students and the black masses such an alliance are dreams made of i was stationed in nigeria for the us information agency during eight of frdjrilkragj jts seventeen officers in the country were american negroes the spring of that year and the advent of birmingham presented the american negro officers with a particularly difficult informationpersuasion problem several who became especially adept in parring nigerian questions about us race

happening in birmingham was a good thing painful evidence that a basic change is being wrought etc at no time during nigerias current crisis have i had the opportunity to ask a us based nigerian information officer whats going on over there whats the trouble all about but if i did ask one and he were a good information officer hed probably tell me precisely what we told him its bad yes but lets put it in perspective he may or may not convince me that what appears to be nigerian chaos is really a good thing but the arguments he could marshal deserve far more consideration than they are getting in the current unbalanced reporting of these events what is happening in nigeria is bad but lets put it in perspective to accept the current press view that nigeria the most stable and most democratic black african republic is coming apart is to betray ones lack of information regarding what the real precoup nigeria was like for one thing it was never really stable or united if we mean by that a relatively permanent sovereign systemit was a subsystem of the british colonial em pire and in spite of a series of constitutional conventions sponsored by the british in preparing nigeria for independence little effective preparation took place instead the british left the country firmly in the hands of its favored tribe hausanortherners via a suspicious head count census that turned out to be the seed of the troubles currently reaped hence precoup nigeria never successfully solved the riddle that baffles newly sovereign states the problem of powerwho shall rule in accord with what authority this problem was particularly crucial for nigeria because this was not a country of disorganized tribal groupings but a combination of several peoples who as basil davidson put it had every right to consider themselves nations even within the narrowest meaning of the term he later remarks that it is extraordinary after all that nigeria should exist at all this was indeed extraordinary because the differences that existed and still exist between nigerias big three nonnations yorubaland iboland hausaland include differences in language religion in the ways communities are organized and ruled and basic differences toward the nature of life itselftheir only significant common heritage was british colonialism and that even differed between northern and southern nigeria the hard truth is that the multitribal multinational combination called nigeria was never the united sovereignty we came to hail in our press but rather a trial marriage in which the issue of who should be boss was never really settled in retrospect the myth of one nigeria was perhaps as much the creature of nonnigerians as nigerians and one of the side tragedies surrounding this myth was that we the west needed and wanted a united nigeria more than the nigerians so what relevance does this have for what we are seeing in nigeria it means that what we are witnessing is not the disintegration of in the us than to the failure of a colonial effort to make it so this event is less akin to the civil war in the u s than to the failure of the league of nations if we concerned ourselves less with predictions of doom for the rest of africa and more with an analysis of why this is happening we may well learn a few things as important to africaafterthenigeriancrisis as was the myth of one nigeria to the africa before the crisis the most potent lesson to be learned is that most of black africas nations created by the arbitrary groupings of former colonial simply may not survive under the circumstances it may be better to let them come apart and regroup along lines of their own choosing forming new nations with more workable economic and cultural eombinationsand certainly with more harmonious tribal groupings this possibility of complete disintegration followed by a more meaningful reintegration is a bitter pill for most africans and their wellwishers to swallow facing the first part of the proposition disintegration would be less painful however if they had more confidence in the ability of the africans to pull off the second part reintegration i am one of those who is confident that they can all the africans talk about african personality and african unity simply has to mean something and it could mean much more in more meaningful african states whats happening over there is bad yes but lets see it in this perspective during world war ii the nd infantry di vision left its heado quarters in the arizo w m na desert and crossed the atlantic to italy to engage the nazi and fascist enemy in the mountains of tuscany and in the valley of the po trudging to the front and in the cities that served as leave centers between battles the black soldiers of the nd division took up fists and guns against still another enemythe white fellowsoldier from back home across the nation now veterans of vietnam are returning home to take up their lives after having foughtstill one more timefor the preservation of democracy and the black veterans among them face as did their fathers after world war ii and their grandfathers after world war i the same denial of their rights of citizenship they have put their lives on the line for an idea which for them remains a promise such is an old american custom as old as the republic itself for crispus attucks the bold black man who was the first rebel to give his life in the revolt against the british would have fared no better than his heirs had he lived to enjoy the fruits of his heroism partly because black men have been refused their due as citizens and as warriors history has not underscored their roles and their heroism but there are movements afoot now to put history in perspective and a number of books are being published which unearth facts of the black mans contribution to the story of america which historians once very carefully buried one such book is the buffalo soldiers a narrative of the negro cavalry in the west written by william leckie and published during last spring by the university of oklahoma press the author is dean of the graduate school of the university of toledo ohio and author of another book on the west also published by the university of oklahoma press the military conquest of the southern plains the buffalo soldiers is a carefully researched report on the black men who were recruited for the ninth and tenth regiments of the united states army following the civil war they were taken into the army primarily to use in controlling and pacifying the indians whose lands the government had seized there were no experienced negro officers and the congress provided that all the officers were to be white mr leckie says and he indicates that the officers selected to head the two regiments of cavalry were capable and compassionate men considering the circumstances the commander of the ninth cavalry was edward hatch a blond blueeyed native of maine and a veteran of the civil war who had ended his duty there as a brevet major general of volunteers the commander of the tenth cavalry was benjamin grierson a scarredface former music teacher who had contributed materially to grants successful operations around vicksburg the order to form the two regiments was sent out by general ulysses s grant in august and colonel hatch established headquarters in greenville la while colonel grierson set up headquarters at fort leavenworth kansas there were the usual arguments about the impossibility of black men becoming good soldiers and the recruiters who fanned out over the east and south to enlist recruits made little effort to select ablebodied men the pay was a month plusof coursefood clothing and shelter which seemed a very good proposition indeed to many freedmen despite the fact many of them were too light too young and had weak constitutions also white officers were extremely reluctant to join units made up of black recruits and the securing of a necessary complement of officers delayed formation of the calvary unitsmr leckie sheds an amusing sidelight on one of the officers who refused to command black troops the dashing boy general george a custer refused a lieutenant colonelcy with the ninth and wrangled the same rank in the newly formed seventh calvarya decision that was probably a stroke of good fortune for the ninth and launched custer on the road to the little big horn and a dubious niche in history years later in the training camps the black soldiers were quartered in the least desirable areas causing many to become ill they were not permitted to march in review along with white troops on the post and they were the victims of general discrimination at fort leavenworth colonel grierson complained against such treatment and against the fact that the horses supplied to the troops were for the most part old and cripple by august eight companies of the tenth calvary were in the field three in indian territory and the others stationed at posts and camps along the kansas pacific railroad then under construction soon afterwards colonel grierson transferred his headquarters to fort riley kansas where the organization of the other four companies of the regiment was completed for more than two decades following the ninth and tenth cavalries served the nation on the great plains and in the mountains and deserts of arizona and new mexico during the first decade the black troops were pitted constantly against the nomad indiansthe comanches the kiowas the kiowaapaches the southern cheyennes and the araphoes the troops won the indians were forced back into reservations it required at least another five years for the black troops to defeat and pacify the indians along the rio grande frontier with mexico and during this time the buffalo soldiers also fought the apaches of new mexico and arizona in mountain nests and on waterless desolate desert wastes writes mr leckie the duties of the regiments would not be limited to fighting indians law and order were little more than a hope in the postcivil war southwest and civil authorities were compelled constantly to call upon the army to assist in rounding up border scum the region swarmed with cattle thieves as well as men who killed with little or no provocation petty scheming and sometimes murderous politicians combined with greedy land and cattle barons crooked government contractors heartless indian agents and landhungry homesteaders were the source of civil broils of a scope far beyond control of local or state authority the result was inevitable involvement in civil affairs for the ninth and tenth with little hope or expectation of gratitude regardless of outcome or contributionthe two regiments moved west right into the middle of an indian war of almost unprecedented scope and violence the indians had brought the building of the railroad to a virtual standstill and were chasing away settlers scalping traders and scattering cattle the troops moved in to protect railroad workers and stations escort stage coaches and trains and generally scouting the area even an outbreak of cholera among the men which killed a number of them did not relieve them of the heavy responsibility to guard the encroaching forces of civilization battle experience and responsibility mellowed the black recruits and turned them into efficient soldiers mr leckie reports the indians gained a great respect for them as fighting men and it was the indians who gave the troops the name buffalo soldiers many of the individual tales of extraordinary heroism and valor exhibited by the black troops are recounted in the book as well as the facts of the governments lack of consideration of them and the tendency to overwork them an example the buffalo soldiers hardly had time to cool their saddles detachments were necessary for constant escort to stages and trains to protect workers at the end of track and to scout along the smoky hill saline and solomon rivers in august alone the overworked troopers scouted more than miles searching for the flitting red raiders september was more of the same until the middle of the month then captain g w graham with men of i company struck and followed a trail along the denver road until they reached big sandy creek here cheyennes were waiting and engaged them in a bitter fight at close quarters the men of i in their first encounter and outnumbered badly fought like cornered wildcats when the engagement ended at nightfall cheyennes were dead and wounded graham reported his loss as one man wounded and horses either killed or missing the book throws significant light on the career and fate of lt henry flipper the first and only negro officer in the tenth regiment a hero on the front lt flipper later faced disgrace because of the jealousv of his fellow officers all of whom were white the summer of found lieutenant flipper in major trouble the only negro officer in the united states army flipper had been assigned to nolans a company he was well received by officers and men and proved an excellent soldier his services in the victorio war had won plaudits from both nolan and grierson and a bright career seemed assured clouds appeared on the horizon when a company came in to fort concho flipper found a riding companion in one of the few eligible young ladies at the post and his attentions aroused the resentment of some of his fellow officers one of the officers who resented lt flipper was a lt charles nordstrom who previously had enjoyed the ladys favors the upshot of the antagonism was that lt flipper named post commissary was arrested for embezzling and confined to the post guardhouse the black officer was later cleared of embezzlement charges but nevertheless convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer and booted out of the cavalry to the end of his days flipper maintained that he was the victim of a plot hatched by colonel shafter lt nordstrom and lt louis wilhelm by the tenth was no longer needed on the texas frontier settlement law and order which the regiment had done so much to further had arrived the sioux troubles of and the fight at drexel mission capped the long career of the ninth cavcontinued from page airy on the frontier this performance was in keeping with the record of the regiment since its departure from san antonio years before four companies marched an incredible miles under blizzard conditions fought two engagements and saved a command twice their strength from grievous loss they received little official recognition alas that is a familiar story it was true of the original buffalo soldiers and true of those who followedunder the buffalo bannerthree quarters of a century later in the mountains of italy and no doubt it will be true of all those black young men now fighting the nations war in southeast asia the buffalo soldiers were brave and valiant men and though there is little reason to be happy that they helped to destroy the indian tribes who were the original settlers of this land it is more than a little appropriate that their role in the development of the west be toldat lastin detail and with fairness it was not until rash man x the little black muslim began talking to us my friend teddy crawford and me that i began to notice for him the teasing seemed all for fun but i was living through a very serious vulnerable summer so there was something deeper than fun in it for me rashman was a small man four inches shorter than i and though i was skinny then rashman was skinnier he was a neat taut man with skin the color of pitch his neatness and his dignity prevented his looking scrawny even with his knees and elbows coming to points as they did when he bent them beneath his starched white barbers uniform his hair was peppergray and always neat and parted and i never saw him once when he needed a shave that saturday morning when teddy crawford and i entered his barbershop the bums off ninth street followed us bringing with them their usual odor of tobacco filth and wine to mix with the odor of talc and aftershave lotion in side they took seats along the wall to wait for the teasing that always followed when rashman and i got together rashmans wit was as sharp as the razor he shaved himself with and i was foolish enough to challenge him he had a clever way making small things seem significant thus leaving them no longer small for example that saturday while i was in the chair he brought to my attention that all the women in my fathers churchs woman society for christian service were even as dark as teddy crawford and i and we were only medium brown yes and i remember how rashman had stopped me when i said only medium brown thus succeeding cleverly at making the bums think that i had said that we had fallen away from grace by only that much that at least we were not black i didnt say that i challenged quickly but rashman was already laughing what i called then his little wickerwire laugh way back in the roof of his mouth he cut me off so i would not have a chance to explain myself dont let folks brain wash you son he said whenever we faced off like this and he scored first he always spoke rapidly so i would not be able to score back i guess the christians taught you that black is the color of evil he laughed deliciously be careful son be careful then of course brain washing is seldom very painful and if its done subtly you never know its happened i knew a fellow once who went his entire life brain washed died happy though he winked at the bums and bent over to pump my chair up a little higher the bums smiled a few of them cleared their throats and there i was defenseless sitting in the middle of the shop with the silly barbers cloth tied around my neck wait youre trying to make these gentlemen think that i no im not criticizing you nooo i dont blame you one little bit its very hard to stand against an entire christian civilization its no fun having to make up everything from scratch better a servant in the house of the lord than a king among the unholy huh is that the way the bible says it he laughed again i dont blame you one iota why why enter the woods if you are not sure you can find your way out the bums laughed partly at me and partly with me we all have to enter the woods sometime i said oh sure yes yes its not bad to come in just dont come too deep come in look around then scat back he spun my chair you jump to conclusions too fast i said but this was not one of my good answers it did not get a rise out of the bums as some of my cracks used to doyes i do i do i shouldnt blame you for give me a chance to talk oh yes alright i got down out of the chair talking trying to hit on something that would swing the bums to my side but rashman had me too far down he could afford to smile complacently while i argued someone else got in the chair and he began pumping the chair up again after much grumbling from teddy crawford we left but only after i declared that i would be back as soon as i got myself together he sent me out onto the sidewalk with laughter and catcalls following me i laughed myself i liked rashman and i knew that he and the bums liked me but the only bad thing was he had been defeating me too soundly and too often ever since back in may when too much seriousness began to creep into my mood rashmans barber shop was the cleanest business on ninth street however my father warned me many times not to go there and listen to rashmans bile but teddy crawford and i with our money in our pockets would go down to ninth street on saturday morning and wander around until i could talk teddy into going to rashmans shop instead of to one of the others i always had to promise him that afterwards i would go with him up to maxine greens apartment over the tom thumb tailor shop maxines mother was never home on saturday mornings so i kept maxines three younger brothers outside while teddy slipped the meat to her in the bedroom okay teddy said on the first saturday in july only one week after he had promised never to go with me again ill go if you promise not to waste all day arguing with that nut okay to hell with rashman i said as we were coming down from teddys house toward the upper end of ninth street now youre talking baby teddy said walking widelegged filling his lungs with air obviously thinking about maxine green hey looka here rashman said as i pushed his front door open my little friends from the hill have come back the heavy glass door sucked close behind us i thought i scared you children away last time making light of your lord and saviour jesus christ like i did he spoke loud enough for everyone in the shop to hear at least ten men had followed us in two of them had to stand because there were not enough seats teddy and i took our seats along the wall under the row of gleaming mirrors to wait our turns in the chairs rashmans assistant a leanquiet boy who came in from st louis each weekend to work at rashmans mosque barber shop always cut teddys hair he liked to cut close and that was the way teddys mother liked it rashman did not say anything more to me until i got in the chair this was a tactic of his then how are things up home he said as i sat down did you tell the reverend what i said last week yeah i lied he said one of these days a bolt of lightnings going to hit your vilifying soul shaderow who had just sat down in the seat i had vacated laughed and repronounced my word rashman laughed and shook out the large pinstriped cover cloth he waved it in front of me like a magician teddy got into the chair next to mine the two men who had been playing checkers back near the shoeshine stand turned around to watch the bums seemed out of place with their tattered clothing and dirty bodies in the gleaming tile glass and porcelain shop the bright july sunlight passing thru the large clean front windows highlighted their filth it showed clearly the spittle in the mouth of one toothless one who was smiling as rashman spun me around rashman began by combing my hair briskly it was kinky because with all the reading i was doing i did not have time to care for it he made it pop and made the dust fly to put me further at a disadvantage by now all the bums were smiling waiting for the argument between me and rashman x the only negro in town who had courage enough to turn his back completely on christianity what words of wisdom do you have for us today my young man rashman asked none i answered and looked over at teddy crawford still believe in the saving grace of jesus christ he asked biblically knowing that i was going to say yes doesnt it frighten you being in here where lightning might strike then no how about you young man rashman asked spinning teddys chair so abruptly that the other barber had to jerk his clippers back teddy smiled fawningly his oily peanutsmooth complexion reddened his fat slick cheeks and round slick head seemed to fill up with blood no sir rashman let him go teddy was not the one he wanted he wanted me i was the outspoken one besides i had secretly been considering following my father into the christian ministry i suspected that rashman knew this and this was why he taunted me more than teddy we argued but everytime i was about to make a good point rashman would spin me away from my audience i would be facing myself selfconsciously in the mirror behind the chair the image of the row of bums bouncing back and forth between the mirrors on the opposite walls then rashman would pop my hair and the bums would roar i stood up when he was done and let him brush the hair off my green and yellow polo shirt teddy was finished long before i was he was in a hurry to get up to maxines christianity is dead thats a fact and it makes you a necrophiliac rashman sang the bums broke up over this word they smacked their thighs and laughed amen yea tell it like it is i waved rashman away as i followed teddy toward the door i had to laugh too when shaderow almost choked trying to repronounce necrophiliac but my laughter was not deep too much of what rashman said was too important the next sunday was a bright hot day i got up early let the sun into my room dressed carelessly and went outside thinking about rashman i wanted to skip church but i knew that i would not be able to tell my father why i walked around for a long time trying to decide what to do our church was the largest negro methodist church in the district and there were only three or four white churches largerall of them city churches up in st louis it was a natural stone building like the parsonage in which we lived they both sat on a grassy plot a block and a half from the negro college the neighborhood was not at all like you would picture a negro ghetto the houses and lawns were all wellcared for most of the houses were brick or stone and the few of them that were woodframe were in good repair the vacant lots around the campus and the church were all well cared for the streets were all paved sidewalks ran on both sides all the way up from ninth street back past carson avenue and laterally on all sides from bullock to canterberry except for the two blocks where the wall and the iron fence of the community cemetery precluded sidewalks nearly everyone in the entire neighborhood was a member of my fathers church most of them were teachers at hl single high school or over at the college ours was a world of secure jobs and easy living the bigotry and injustice which menaced the lives of so many black people during these years was closed out of it i walked down toward mason street thinking about that when i got down almost to where teddy crawford lived younger children started to come out of the houses dressed for sunday school i thought it best that beat it back and get ready to teach my sunday school class all during the hour i was hot with anxiety in the airconditioned building the lesson was about david the shepherd what i wondered did that have to do with anything obviously rashman had a way of getting weekly bulletins from the church for just as he said this was installation sunday for the new officers of the womans society for christian service i watched them as they filed past me toward the front of the church ah and you watch them rashman had said everyone of them past the age thirty has to wear glasses because their eyes are weak mongrelizations done it and you watch every one of them will be fat from over indulgence and lack of discipline on sunday as i watched the women i hated their stuffy sanctimonious smiles all of them were lightskinned plump and slightly bent all except two wore glasses i wondered if this was just a coincidence that rashman had noticed and decided to use against me or whether however silly scientifically it might seem his statement about mongrelization had some truth to it i thought for a moment then i shook my head no i could picture him behind his chair his image in the mirror showing his scissors poised above my unkempt hair his face caught for one static moment between smiles his own eyes aided by thin rimless glasses as i sat there in church i thought that i could hear his brief wickerwire laughter old mrs turner my high school civics teacher was standing two down from the end she had been called forward as the new recording secretary i focused my attention on her she used to call me her little preacher i shook with fear at the prospect that rashman might find out and tell it in the crowded barber shop as i looked at mrs turner i filled up with anger because even now i was arguing with rashman and losing mrs turner was too much for me to explain to someone like the bums rashman would get the better of me mrs turner was a big buttercolored woman who wore heavy coke bottlebottom glasses she hated her job and she hated the kids she had to teach all she taught for was the money in it that was plain from the way she acted i knew how much rashman would make of the contempt she had for the poorer kids from over in chambers who came to school poorly dressed and often a little dirty these kids were either timid and backwards or too manish or womanish for their ages to suit mrs turner the one group she ignored as often as she could and the others she expelled whenever she could get away with it i knew how rashman would tease me about the way mrs turner complimented me for not being like them her little preacher i shook my head again she did have the biggest tits on the faculty i could score with the bums by mentioning that and by adding that i was sure they didnt grow because of heavy sexual activity she must play with them every night and boy you ought to see them big yellow thighs when she sits up in the window sill at school i would say to make the bums laugh id sure like to get some of that stuff they would break up over thatlittle skinny me and big mrs turner still i would lose the argument with rashman because he knew me too well to be sidetracked but i was beginning to know rashman too he was wrong his science was screwed up shaderow and the others knew he was wrong too they were christians i had heard how groups of them would get juiced up on saturday night and pile into filberts car and go over to elder nashs church and sing and cry about whatever they had losta mother or father or something but rashman was right about them in a way christianity would never do more for them than make they feel a little better for a little while like a piece of blues for a month i did not go back to see rashman i was not ready to face him he was wrong but i did not know how to convince him his house sat across a vacant lot from his shop it was one of only three or four neat houses amid the squalor that was ninth street the house seemed very small sitting by itself behind a very straight wire fence unlike most of the houses around it it was freshly painted and all the boards were in place the house sat on piles and back under it the dirt was raked as level as concrete usually after eight oclock in the evening the windows in his house would darken i would see them as i passed taking nancy adkins home to chambers as far as i knew the lean boy from st louis was the only nonrelative who had ever entered rashmans house shaderow and filbert never had even the insurance man left him alone often i wanted to stop by nancy would say that it was all right with her but i was always a little too afraid i knew that rashman would be different without the bums to show off fordifferent and deeper often as i passed the house i would comment on how lonely it must get for rashman in there because at heart he was a talker the windows in the little old house would seem like halfclosed darkened eyes looking out on this dumping ground of christian civilization i went for six weeks without seeing rashman when my mother made what seemed her final threat i went to mr granisons barber shop to get my hair cut but the sunday after father let the man from the state fish and game board mealymouth the morning service i decided to go down to see rashman i was met at the door by his wife she was a small black woman who looked or years older than rashman my husband is not home she said but do come in she did not wait to see if i was going to follow but simply turned and walked ahead of me down the hallway into the living room the house had a stale odor inside like the odor inside the houses of very old people no sunlight came through the windows which were heavily draped the living room that we entered was small the heavy oldfashioned chair and sofa were covered with matching faded flowery slipcovers the rug was of a hard weave on the wall was a picture of rashman receiving his diploma from a high school in st louis this made me wonder how old rashman really was he had many gray hairs but his skin was very smooth he could be any age i examined the picture for a date but found none when i turned away from the wall mrs x motioned for me to sit in the chair under the picture she sat on the sofa across the room rashman has gone to st louis now for a little while she said he was very discontented here he told me a lot about you said you were the smartest youngster he had seen in a while not really i said and waved her comment away she looked at me and smiled he said when you get out of college you will be a great asset to the race the masses of our people need so much it always must be hoped that your generation will do much better than ours she examined me again with that curious look of hers two barefooted baldheaded boys of about four or five ran to the living room door and peeped in she laughed and called them forward pharoah and benda this is mr billy aaron she pushed them forward to meet me the bigger one took his fingers out of his mouth and gave me his wet hand to shake i was glad for their presence because i felt that their mother was very sad about something and i was not sure that i would know how to respond to it if she would decide to tell me what it was i took the smaller boy and tossed him toward the ceiling the bigger one pushed into my arms for some of the same treatment while i was engaged with them their mother slipped out of the room and brought back a glass of iced tea the two boys sat on my knees while i drank then i heard their sister come downstairs i knew that it was shera because i remembered that she was a very slow walker at home she was a much more imposing girl than at school she wore no makeup and her hair had been cut very short and had not been hot combed in a long time how was church this morning she asked she did not call me billy as she did at school but mr aaron as her mother called me when she asked shera you do know mr aaron do you not yes mother mr aaron is the best athlete in the tenth grade well her mother said rather sagelike rashman told me that how was church shera asked and smiled good i said and shrugged she must have known about the man from the fish and game board i did not know if she were going to tell rashman i did not know if i really cared we were christians once even shera was mrs x said we were church of god in christ she waited for a moment she seemed happy remembering you dont sing spirituals in your church do you no we sing anthems chorals neither word sounded right so i tried again you know hymns yes she said chorals are nice i knew she was saying this to make me feel good she looked like the kind who had loved spirituals in that other life of hers i talked for a long time with shera and mrs x about my plans to go to college and someday to be a writer as i talked i kept thinking yes education i must get that i cannot allow this disenchantment in me to drive me to the same conclusions that rashmans had driven him for i was sure now that his wife had with sadness let him go away to do whatever his restlessness was forcing him to do i was sure that when he left home he did not know himself exactly what that was in st louis the black muslims had started to make stands against the police i hoped very hard that this would not lead to violence in his absence i felt closer to rashman than i ever had i was afraid for him i was afraid that he had gone away to do what he said to make a stand against an entire civilization i wished that he had not gone i wanted to argue with him again i wanted to convince him that what he felt he had to do was not necessary but i was sure that if i had been given the chance to talk to him again i would not have known what to say the second annual fisk university writers conference settled into the comfort of an established institution during the threeday session april the fireworks of the student rebellion earlier in the month echoed on the campus and in the city of nashville but the conference proceeded in an atmosphere of calm and congeniality the conference theme was the black writer and human rights and novelist john o killens who as writerinresidence and head of the campus writers workshop had organized the conference invited seven writers to participate in panels devoted to a consideration of human rights as relates to the writers particular literary disciplines the writers were novelists ronald fair and mr killens nonfiction authors lerone bennett jr and john henrik clarke poets gwendolyn brooks and margaret danner and playwrights leroi jones and ronald milner mr killens was assisted by workshop students bessie frazier lonnetta gaines donald graham phyllis griffith harold lazard and kathryn mickens four of whom introduced the visiting authors to the audiences in the appleton room of historic jubilee hall the turn out for all the panel discussions was large and enthusiastic and the final sessions drew a crowd which left even standing room at a premium the attraction understandably was leroi jones the poetplaywright delivered a meaty and provocative speech and then ignited the student audience with a thoroughly effective theatrical reading of a group of his poems the conference proceedings were marked by a notable lack of controversy probably because those who might have disagreed with the panelists declined to appear or if they were present in the audience they remained silent from all indications also few members of the faculty were in attendance with one or two exceptions the visiting writers were not received by faculty members and those faculty members who made the effort to greet the writers were not from the english department on a singularly unfortunate occasion two panelists were forced to answer one of the young workshop hosts who implied impertinently that older black poets had not been paying their dues the student might have saved himself considerable embarrassment by reading in advance some of the work of the poets who shared the platform with him lerone bennett jr who is senior editor of ebony magazine as well as author of four published books and a fifth to be published this summer was asked to explain how he a blackoriented writer justified his association with a magazine which appeared to disdain blackness in its advertisements and in some features and to idealize white middleclass values in its features the author who is frequently confronted with such questions made no effort to justify the magazines editorial policies and directions however he did point to the magazines contributions in the area of negro history and black consciousness and sought without much success to explain the hard facts of economics which influenced the magazines publisher in catering to what is demonstrably the general public preference the growth of black consciousness on the fisk campus was evident it is not possible to gauge novelist john o killens direct influence on this phenomenon but the writers relaxed informal manner and his total lack of pomp and pretention cannot but have proved a remarkable change for a faculty member on the campus the thrust of his relationship with the student has been to narrow the distance between teacher and student rather than to expand it during the final session of the fisk conference those in attendance drafted and approved a statement in support of dr martin_luther_king jr and his stand relative to the war in vietnam the statement which had the prior approval of writerpanelists who had departed for home lerone bennett jr ronald fair read as follows we support dr martin l kings stand in his opposition to the war in vietnam for many diverse personal reasons but most especially because dr_king has been consistent in his desire for nonviolence both within american borders and by america herself abroad we find it difficult to understand why a man hailed for his stand on nonviolence and a recipient of the nobel peace prize should now be castigated because he refuses to mount the white charger to lead brave young men into armed battle dr_king has never stood for armed battle and we can find no overwhelming reason for him to send young men to kill now he has stood ready to give his life in love for peace not in malice for war and for this we commend him those endorsing the statement included john o killens john henrik clarke leroi jones ronald milner the week following the writers conference ushered in the th annual festival of music and art on campus during which at least three other noted writers appeared before the students paule marshall novelist and short story writer spoke on legacy in black robert hayden poet and fisk teacher read from his recently published book selected poems and robert e lee coauthor of the comedy auntie mame addressed the assembly other highlights of the festival included an exhibition of sculptures by john w rhoden and paintings by walter williams a concert by miriam makeba a concert by the fisk jubilee singers and a dance recital under the direction of mrs mabel r love choreographer should the new african nations try first to organize their own human resources and concentrate on building viable economic institutions at home or should they seek to develop into modern nations through allout policies of economic interdependency with the great industrial countries of the west this was one of the questions posed during a conversation with africa seminar sponsored by the phelpsstokes fund may at holly knoll the robert r moton conference center at capahosic virginia during the seminar an american employee of a federal agency advanced the suggestion that emergent africas best bet for development lay in economic interdependency with the industrial giants the american was forcefully challenged by the ambassador of an east african nation who described the true nature of economic interdependency between africa and the west as one of western rapacity of african natural resources the ambassador agreed that africa needs the technology and capital of the west but he declared thatfor his country at any ratethat technology and capital was welcome only if it came to africa on africas terms during the threeday seminar some africans and afroamericans spoke with eloquence candor and occasionally much heat on such general topics as the nature of africanamerican relations the role of afroamerican colleges can play in the advancement of africa the urgent need for the intellectual emancipation of all black people the mutual problems and destiny of black people on the two continents and the need for afroamericans to rally to the support of freedom movements in those areas of africa still under european domination capahosic is not much of a town and the casual motorist is likely to drive past it without being aware of holly knoll or of the existence and purpose of the conference center however the group of black people of remarkably varied career backgrounds and philosophical outlook who travelled to the idyllic little retreat on the banks of the york river had the best of motives for seeking it out they came for a serious dialogue on the problems facing black people everywhere most of them believing that the genuine freedom of black people in any land is compromised so long as black people in any other land remain unfree it was the second such seminar organized by the phelpsstokes fund and possibly because of the previous experience all went like clockwork a few of the guests arrived by automobile driving in from washington points in virginia and even from new york city but most arrivals were met at the airport in richmond and chauffeured out to capahosic through verdant and peaceful country holly knoll which is growing in importance as a conference center is equipped to accommodate up to people comfortably the spacious manor house has more than a dozen bedrooms as well as a dining room and salons there is a motel with some six apartments and a rustic log cabin with three bedrooms for relaxation there is a game room which adjoins the conference room tennis courts a swimming pool and a pier jutting out into the river which makes boating fishing or even swimming possible holly knoll was established by the robert r moton memorial foundation in honor of the former president of tuskegee institute and it is supported by gifts and guided by the phelpsstokes fund whose president is dr frederick d patterson himself a former president of tuskegee the retreat has played host to small groups concerned with dialogueparticularly on matters regarding race relationsfor a decade this years conversation with africa seminar attracted a remarkably diverse group of conversants a reflection

assistant personnel director for time inc and charles wilson a writereducator from new york city dr patterson and mr browne also participated in the conversations the negro in his struggle for an equal coexistence has been fed a teething biscuit with a gradualism flavor by his white counterpart in his trips downtown to negotiate that which is rightfully his he has been sent to the bargain basement with the staging of public demonstrations no longer capable of bluffing the white social regime into complete acceptance of the negro it is necessary that he abandon this weapon worn by repetition for a new and even more effective one the negro must unite into one force and together develop new ideas and methods of achieving true and genuine equality this can best be accomplished thru a master maneuver enacted by all black people and under close supervision of sincere leaders leaders whose every move is calculated and interpreted by a nationally elected committee a committee elected by a black vote and representative of that people a committee cognizant of negroes needs desires and goals realizing that the negroes present method for gaining equality is losing its effectiveness i would like to propose an idea designed to corporate all negroes and other liberal minded sympathizers into a tactful unit i suggest first listing the names twentyfive or more of responsible negroes negroes that are nationally known and whom black america feels is capable of legislating and controlling a mass negro movement the names submitted men and women by individuals or organizations would be negroes they feel possess the necessary qualifications to represent them and whose decisions they would respect and trust without censorship after composing such a list a national vote could be taken on the names received and the ten receiving the most votes would comprise the committee each committee member representing a certain number of states would have representation in that state these representatives primarily would be responsible for reaching negroes in their prospective precincts they will act as a liaison between the committee and the negro population relaying the strategy necessary to stage an effective national maneuver it is my firm belief that this committee with a nationally pledged negro support could effectively pressure the white society into complete admission people interested in discussing developing or modifying this idea may write to ronald l lyles central avenue washington d c enjoyed the march issue of negro digest with its informative notes on negro writers jazz etc clemmont e vontress article should your child attend a ne gro college particularly caught my attention his points concerning the autocratic often antiintellectual atmosphere of most negro campuses are very well taken however i think what is really needed is better negro colleges rather than none at all as the authors logic would suggest in spite of much superficial instruction it is worth noting the rich history of achievement that centers around the uncf colleges after all we didnt just spring from africa and arrive intact where we are now things happened things that are part of a history every negro needs to know at a time when negro intellectuals are bitterly grasping for some kind of meaningful racial identity there are many things that can be said in favor of attending a negro school at least for a while one thing the negro colleges have given southern negroes is an academic tradition however modest and a respect for family stability community achievement and the simple yes middle class things of the good life a lack of these traditions is what really makes harlem in sophisticated manhattan a bigger hell hole than atlanta ga pfc charles s brown fort monmouth new jersey black women dear editor any black woman who suffers from the wig and hot iron mentality deserves no respect the hot iron and wig are openbook manifestations that she doesnt respect herself arent you sick of seeing the wigladen paintfaced select few being trotted before the tv cameras they lean over backwards to satisfy one never hears so many oohs and ahs or sees so much skinning and grinning to please the white program host and audience i wonder if they have ever been schooled on the subject of a new day acomin or been hipped to the fact that there is a publication called negro digest it certainly is a sad day and no wonder a black writerprobably long ago dubbed responsible by the good white folkcomes out throwing love and kisses to a black woman singer for no longer wearing her hair natural the black woman must learn to respect herself the lack of her selfrespect is not limited to the hot iron and wig it reaches to far greater proportions the rank gall of some black women after reaching a certain stage in their climb to become a celebrity bemoaning the fact that there are no black men on their level is disgusting this is the best alibi that they can fabricate in order to do what they had in mind all along have white menand not necessarily in marriage it seems peculiar that so many black women embark upon careers in which white men are their chief benefactors could be that black women should stop concentrating so much on singing and dancing which so often be comes jigdancing footshuffling etc goodness knows that we have been entertained enough the black woman must break that ugly alliance with the white man that j often matures in halfwhite babies sitting on black knees she must stop j trying to build a logic around wigs and hot irons by using the tired excuse that miss ann also uses the beauty parlor why not a broad nose thick lips wide hips black skin i and natural hair all of these seem i to me to have been godgiven i i revere black women i respect a black women but only those who i live in the context of reality in truth the hopes of the great society have been overcome by the fears and frustrations of vietnam the pursuit of this widened war has narrowed domestic welfare programs making the poor white and negro bear the heaviest burdens both at the front and at home the antipoverty program is cautiously initiated zealously supervised and evaluated for immediate results while billions are liberally expended for this illconsidered war the recently revealed misestimate of the war budget amounts to billion for a single year this error alone is more than five times the amount committed to antipoverty programs the security we profess to seek in foreign adventures we will lose in our decaying cities the bombs in vietnam explode at home they destroy the dream and possibility for a decent america if we reversed investments and gave the armed forces the antipoverty budget the generals could be forgiven if they walked off the battlefield in disgust poverty urban problems and social progress generally are ignored when the guns of war become a national obsession when it is not our security that is at stake but questionable and vague commitments to reactionary regimes values disintegrate into foolish and adolescent slogans it is estimated that we spend for each enemy we kill while we spend in the socalled war on poverty in america only about for each person classified as poor and much of that goes for salaries of people who are not poor we have escalated the war in vietnam and deescalated the skirmish against poverty it challenges the imagination to contemplate what lives we could transform if we were to cease killing america is a great nation but in this war she seems bent on her destruction through rugged and dazzling achievements america has become the richest and most powerful nation in the world we have built machines that think and instruments that peer into the unfathomable ranges of interstellar space we have built gargantuan bridges to span the seas and gigantic buildings to kiss the skies through our airplanes and spaceships we have dwarfed distance and placed time in chains and through our subways we have penetrated oceanic depths this year our gross national product will reach the astounding figure of billion all of this is a staggering picture of our great power but honesty impels me to admit that our power has often made us arrogant we feel that our money can do anything we arrogantly feel that we have everything to teach other nations and nothing to learn from them we often arrogantly feel that we have some divine messianic mission to police the whole world we are arrogant in not allowing young nations to go through the same growing pains turbulence and revolution that characterizes our history we arm negro soldiers to kill on foreign battlefields but offer little protection for their relatives from beatings and killings in our own south we are willing to make the negro per cent of a citizen in warfare but reduce him to per cent of a citizen on american soil of all good things in life the negro has approximately onehalf those of whites of the bad he has twice that of whites thus half of all nev groes live in substandard housing and he has half the income of whites when we turn to the negative experience of life the negro has a double share there are twice as many negroes in combat in vietnam at the beginning of and twice as many died in action per cent in proportion to their number in the population as whites all of this reveals that our nation has not yet used its vast resources of power to end the long night of poverty racism and mans inhumanity to man enlarged power means enlarged peril if there is not concomitant growth of the soul genuine power is the right use of strength if our nations strength is not used responsibly and with restraint it will be following actons dictum power that tends to corrupt and absolute power that corrupts absolutely our arrogance can be our doom it can bring the curtains down on our national drama ultimately a great nation is a compassionate nation we are challenged in these turbulent days to use our power to speed up the day when every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain let me say finally that i oppose the war in vietnam because i love america i speak out against it not in anger but with anxiety and sorrow in my heart and above all with a passionate desire to see our beloved country stand as the moral example of the world i speak out against this war because i am disappointed with america there can be no great disappointment where there is no great love i am disappointed with our failure to deal positively and forthrightly with triple evils of racism extreme materialism and militarism we are presently moving down a deadend road which can lead to national disaster those of us who love peace must organize as effectively as the war hawks as they spread the propaganda of war we must spread the propaganda of peace we must combine the fervor of the civil_rights movement with the peace movement we must demonstrate teach and preach until the very foundations of our nation are shaken we must work unceasingly to lift this nation that we love to a higher destiny to a new plateau of compassion to a more noble expression of humaneness in october a year after the forma i i tion of the cardozo area arts committee the new school for afroamerican thought was opened and celebrated with a weekend of music drama and art that attracted guests and performers not only from the washington area but also from cleveland pittsburgh new york city and philadelphia within the year they had been organized the committee had held several fund raising efforts became incorporated and rented and decorated a storefront building for classes in art negro history dance basic education music and tutoring services for the neighborhood children the school located in the heart of the cardozo ghetto is managed by a board of directors composed of residents of the area the idea for the school came from gaston neal a poverty program worker who believed that the residents would participate in cultural programs if they could have their own facilities and could have a hand in planning their own programs while the new school is located near howard university which offers many cultural advantages neal felt that the people in the ghetto would not feel comfortable at howard members of the ninemember board and their friends contributed labor and services to cut the cost of making the building fit for use as auditorium classrooms and offices the twostory building once housed an auto repair shop the concrete floors of the main floor were painted battleship gray the back of the stage a slidomatic garage door is painted yellow and is used to bring in and take out large pieces of equipment and musical instruments for the opening artists loaned paintings a piano was borrowed and an announcement was made during the opening program that many items were needed and those wishing to make contributions could do so the director gaston neal is a neighborhood worker for the united planning organization the poverty program organization in washington d c he was born and grew up in pittsburgh and dropped out of school in the ninth grade when a school teacher told him he should take a trade rather than aspire to be a writer for playing hookey and breaking some street lights neal was committed to a reformatory for months many of the times when he played hookey neal could be found in a museum or at an observatory using his cents lunch money for admission fees after he quit school neal bummed around he sold newspapers in night clubs until four in the morning at he tried to enlist in the army but was turned down at he went into the army and learned practical nursing at walter reed army hospital in dc while in the army neal did a lot of reading and began to also do some writing he absorbed the works of langston hughes and richard wright and began writing about the negro gradually he drifted into writing prose poetry after the army he went back to pittsburgh and took odd jobs such as portering or washing dishes for the past years neal has lived in washington and boston as well as in pittsburgh associating with people who are interested in writing music drama dance and art in boston he made friends of harvard students and by listening and reading picked up knowledge beyond his formal junior high school training it was out of this background that gaston neal joined other neighborhood workers and residents whose interests were similar they banded together in the cardozo arts committee spurred by neals drive enthusiasm initiative and ability the group was incorporated organized such events as a weekend of soul and a sale of neighborhood art works when the new school of afroamerican thought opened in washington the cinder block and brick walls were freshly painted and a sympathetic mixed audience half white and half negrowas in attendance the house was crowded to capacity gaston neal greeted the guests thanked them for coming promised them that the opening was only a taste of better things to come and introduced stokely carmichael stokely dapper in dark suit said its good to be here and be a part of such an auspicious opening when i was a child my mother said that negroes were loud mama also said that boys are too loud here in this school we will be able to have loud music if it is a part of our culture we will be able to study art from primitive african to modern together we can raise the level of art to where it belongs we can hook up with that which was lost and reestablish it the opening of this school which began as an idea last year to a reality tonight is testimony of the fact that a baby lived sterling brown poet of howard university greeted the audience briefly congratulating the management on the establishment of the school he said this school was a long time acoming brown considered an angry young man in the early s spoke of his teaching experience in the south and how he had learned after college of the real pressures endured by the southern negroes he read his own poems of negro blues jazz and folklore he read a poem about ma rainey who taught bessie smith to sing the blues when bessie was singing in a church choir he read old lem they come by tens and strong men for sterling brown and for all of the performers there was an almost reverent quiet the audience appeared to be students artists devotees of the arts exceptionally sympathetic with the performers night club singer and recording artist donald leace played a guitar and sang folk songs and spirituals between songs he told how he had visited a class taught at howard university by sterling brown and how he had followed browns suggestion to get folk songs from the library of congress he sang a song of a roadgang chained together at the mississippi state penitentiary leace told how the men sang as they broke rocks to be used for a roadbed the audience joined him in the refrain of every time feel the spirit poet owen dodson chairman of the drama department at howard read some of his poetry we shall never die about the struggle of the jews i am a part of this and confessional his student louise heath read a song cycle of mary mother of jesus l written by dodson argo recording star buck clark who is also a painter played the bongo drums a b spellman poet and magazine writer read some of his poetry the beautiful days adventure of zapato the twist my unborn and wretched children william white john coltrane and jelly roll morton spellman also read some poetry by gaston neal autumn and i looked i and saw history on a hinge george ellis showed a film he wrote and produced ewuzi the title means murder in twi a ghanj ian dialect the film was shot in a ghetto where a negro boy was killed by a policeman for stealing a loaf of bread it was an arty short film strip showing many of the horrors of poverty in the ghetto from the karamu house in cleveland the black arts theatre performers came and read from leroi jones dutchman they also read from james baldwins blues for mr charlie gloria parker read juanitas soliloquy which told of the death of her lover and she expressed her desire to be pregnant in memory of her lover james farrell read funeral sermon after the readings gaston neal introduced lonnie x shebazz the leader of the muslim community in dc the jimmie jackson trio played way out sounds with frank geer on sax sonny man for two by sonny rollins was one of the tunes esp recording pianist guiseppe logan sonny murray on drums joseph from pittsburgh on bass frank wright from cleveland on tenor horn joined for a half hour of serious jazz the yoruba temple dancers from philadelphia played drums and read sermons and told how the history of yoruba began in nigerian culture and was taken to cuba brazil and trinidad the troop was dressed in yoruba attire and prayed chanted beat drums and shook beaded gourds for half an hour when bill harris local school teacher and night club performer played his guitar a bass fiddler from pittsburgh doffed his hat and played a background for him today over onequarter million negroes are attending colleges and universities in this country nearly twothirds of these are enrolled in predominantly negro institutions located in the south and border states are privately supported the remainder or are taxsupported in the main these institutions now house the negro leadership of tomorrow it is from these that one would expect to come tomorrows martin_luther_kings roy wilkenses stokely carmichaels and floyd mckissicks however such a possibility is remote for negro college students have become apathetic to the cause as a negro college professor put it recently they are more interested in their fronts suits wheels cars and skins degrees than they are in the voting rights of negroes in mississippi and alabama in fact the negro campus has become a bastion of conservatism although the students wear their hair au naturel and go to hear stokely carmichael when he comes to campus they are in the main most concerned about getting ahead this means holding down a good job attending negro fraternity and sorority dances and carnivals in downtown hotel ballrooms and living quietly in black suburbia away from all that jazz about civil_rights they merely put in time in college knowing that if they play their cards right they too can live in black suburbia the majority do not want to run the risk of being kicked out of college because of their participation in activist rights programs they have seen what happened to fellowstudents and professors who spoke up ousted students are back home working at menial jobs and the profs many of whomespecially at the height of the civil_rights movement had to leave overnight their teaching posts in southern colleges are in the case of good ones teaching in liberal white institutions in the north or in the case of marginal ones teaching in high schools in the nations ghettos thus wouldbe campus radicals have gotten the message and fast the profs cannot run the risk of losing their expensive homes in black suburbia by participating in civil_rights activities in fact many college presidents encourage new professors to buy homes as soon as possible once they arrive on campus in this way the administration can more easily control their activities in visiting atlanta baton rouge knoxville and baltimore just to mention a few cities where major negro colleges are located one is struck by black college enclaves in which there are homes to be had ranging from to on racial matters residents of these of white legislators or benefactors for support of institutions which they head thus negro college professors have contributed to student apathy on campuses where they teach for some time now it has been recognized that negro leadership has typically been classified into two polar types of behavior accommodation and protest undoubtedly the largest accommodational group in this country is composed of negro college professors while many of them identify strongly with the race at least in privacy their espousal of the negro cause is academic in general they tend to have values similar to those of the white middleclass stronger desires to associate with whites more internalization of negative attitudes toward other negroes and relatively weaker ethnic identification than individuals in lower status positions in the south they like whites have a vested interest in segregation they boast of their nice homes swimming pools and foreign trips while simultaneously criticizing other negroes for acting like niggers in atlanta for example the negro class structure is as rigid as the racial structure upperclass negroes and college professors are generally considered in this category among negroes whose economic security has depended on the white community have accepted discrimination though utilizing in many cases their positions to avoid cruder forms of racial discrimination thus they enjoy a life of ease behind the segregated curtain because they are protected from having to compete with whites the outsiders having accepted so completely their way of life they often feel that it is foolhardy for other negroes not to strive for what they havea nice home in segregated suburbia and a solid place in black society it is understandable that teachers directly or indirectly contribute to the placidity of their students although they are surrounded by social injustice their lectures remain enervate and purblind the student who challenges them is often referred to the counseling center for social adjustment the nice quiet respectful and conservative student is the one who gets the as and ultimately the diploma so proper is the negro college professor that he is literally afraid to take a stand on civil_rights perhaps this is understandable in the south where negro colleges are controlled by white conservatives andor liberalsboth from the north and the southon whom the private colleges depend for contributions more difficult to comprehend however is the behavior of college professors at such universities as howard where ehomes are as conservative as the whites who control their lives through the college presidents who must depend directly or indirectly on the goodwill franklin frazier the late noted sociologist worked for many years while he was acclaimed internationally especially for his book the black bourgeoisie he was persona non grata not only on his own campus but on negro campuses throughout the country in his book dr frazier analyzed the pastimes and interests of the black middleclass in america he therefore caused much consternation among negro intellectuals in general when the book came off the american press in a noted sociologist who at that time was at southern university in baton rouge louisiana was so infuriated that he avowed to go right out and write a book refuting everything frazier had said to this day however his book has not been heard of following in fraziers footsteps is a young chicago university phd nathan hare also now at howard his book the black anglosaxons has created so much furor that he now reports that he is in danger of losing his professorship at the nations most outstanding negro university another negro scholar said that he hoped dr hare will not fritter away his career in contentions over this mass of controversial irrelevances on this score it is interesting to note that white faculty members at negro colleges are given considerable freedom to analyze the negro problem but when a negro professor on the same faculty attempts to do the same he is usually repri manded and runs the risk of being booted out as a troublemaker this is probably why today most of the scholarship on the negro is being written by whites not negroes frequently a few students will take up for their favorite professors who tell it like it is but the college administrators retort that the professors are not there to create racial upheaval but to teach that is teach like it is from the book which is generally written not to be offensive to anybody negro college students are also responsive to the demands of their parents mothers and fathers save and scrape to send their children to college to get book lamin they want them to come back home and be somebody therefore parents take a dim view of sons and daughters who get kicked out of college for getting mixed up in civil_rights actually parents are not always thinking for themselves for it is a known fact that white employers are often instrumental in financing in part at least negro youths in college were it not for mothers washing and scrubbing to send black youth to college many would not be able to go stokely carmichael relates often how his mother worked as a maid in long island for a week to send him to college and how the white lady for whom she worked wanted him a bright colored boy to go to college in the south many of the negro students come even today from sharecropper farms when the landowners discover that their tenants sons and daughters are causing trouble in college they will see to it that times get hard for the parents it is not just professors and parents who indoctrinate negro college students with conservatism perhaps the most influential in this area are the college presidents themselves in addition to controlling the profs they also have a significant influence on their student bodies in the main the negro college is a small institution ranging from to students with the average enrollment being slightly over on such a campus the president has frequent and close contact with the students often he walks through the halls of classroom buildings in the way of high school principals whom students have known back home he the president of a churchrelated or statecontrolled college or university reminds students constantly that they must be ladies and gentlemen above all this means dressing in sundaygomeeting clothes for dinner and staying off the streets like common negroes essentially he is more interested in his students being proper than he is in their learning to think for themselves during sunday convocations and wednesday evening vespers he admonishes students to lead a good life this means being men among men in other words he tells them that they must go out into an integrated society where the color of a mans skin doesnt matter that people are accepted according to what they are not who they are recently one college president advised his students to give up some of their soul ethnic identification if they wanted to be fully accepted in the american society this he said means learning to think talk and act like other americans significantly adults are not the only purveyors of apathy among negro college students today on a broader scale one might say that the total society has shaped the negros whole attitude toward his j existence as a human being in our j society as a member of a society characterized by discrimination the student although negro the subject of discrimination cannot see or understand the wrong that is being done him thus he cannot see he does not accept the propo i sition that negroes in this country suffer injustices because they happened to have been born black j in general the negro students world view is limited by tunnel j vision and egocentricism when asked why he is in college his reply is apt to be that he wants to make a better life for himself in contrast the african student when asked the same question generally relates his being in college to going back home to help his people last summer a young liberian studying economics at the university of wisconsin explained that my specialization is fundamental to help mg my people realize our national goals in other words the negro student like the american society as a whole is materially oriented whereas the african student is politically or nationally oriented differences in purposes for being in college make for strained relationships between negro americans and africans in this country it is because of these differences that americans and negro americans do not relate well one to the other on our college campuses a student from ethiopia reported recently that american negroes never have anything interesting to talk about about african students one american negro retorted that he gets tired of talking about politics all the time it appears that the tense relationship existing between black africans and their american counterparts may be attributed to what the africans perceive as indifference to social injustice on the part of the negro traditionally africans have sought to repeal and counteract injustice in a direct manner when they see american negro students laughingly going about their merry way and indeed seldom discussing intently the american dilemma they are somewhat dismayed to say the least apathy is also a result of racial separatism on the one hand and racial inclusion on the other socially the negro remains exclusive while simultaneously being a part of the total culture in which he lives his major ideas and attitudeshis weltanschauung if you willcome from the total culture not just his subculture in essence then he is driven to demand social changes when the total society promotes or initiates or at least provides an atmosphere for such a demand in the meantime his emphasis is on personal change not group that is subgroup change thus the individual student is interested in what he can do to improve his life not the life of his people as is the case with most african students whom he encounters on american campuses often this attitude is perpetuated through lack of acquaintance with vital issues which is obtained through staying abreast of social problems and alternatives to stay abreast of relevant issues is to stay in touch with ones immediate and current environment this means reading the daily papers and keeping up with the melange of social issues which affect our daily lives individuals who are acquainted with their history and know how it relates not only to their position individually but to the position of their race in general are the ones who are in tune with their immediate environment this implies that students who read and think about things which are not presented in their classrooms by their professors are far ahead of those who sit like buckets waiting to be filled thus in the final analysis the blame for apathy on the negro campus cannot be laid directly at the feet of any person or persons but the student himself so long as students remain passive listeners to impetuous speakers of the stokely carmichael ilk so long as they evaluate activist speeches as entertainment so long as they refuse to accept these as calls for action they will remain passive observers they will remain bystanders to what is happening around them and in so doing they will remain as a segment of the negro population the lumpenproletariat those who are least capable of engaging in concerted action to improve their lot in the meantime the struggle for civil_rights will undoubtedly be carried on by the present but limited number of young activists these in the main are dropouts or kickouts from southern and northern colleges for example during the summer of about onethird of the activists engaged in voter registration activities throughout the south were for the most part dropouts from white colleges and universities in the north and a handful who had attended negro colleges before becoming disenchanted with their campus existence others were jobless individuals who had latched on to the movement to find a place for themselves one young man a philosophy major at anderson college had been with the movement for three years either with sclc or a related group he reported that he had been offered a scholarship to continue his education but thought he would rather stay at his work in the south besides he had made a lot of friends while in the movement one of these a young blonde about he introduced as having been a student at mount holyoke how long the present group of young and sometimes crude and often undisciplined radicals can continue to carry the activist push for civil_rights by themselves remains to be seen how long they can withstand negative reactions to their aweinspiring slogans solicits speculation from present indications it seems safe to say that unless negro college students become socially involved and sensitive to the fulfillment of these rights leadership of and direction to the civil_rights movement will revert to whites in essence whites will determine what the goals of the movement shall be the chances of future martin_luther_kings roy wilkinses and stokely carmichaels coming forward to replace those already on the line will be nil recent events in africa have shown that something went wrong not only with the body p iic y f that continent but also with the ideology and the philosophy on which the african continents commitment to total freedom was founded men of goodwill who are interested in the future of africa and the welfare of the africans will agree that at this critical moment of human history africans ought to trace back their locus and reassume the beliefs and values that displayed their toga virillis and sounded the death knell of foreign domination they will also agree that the blessings of human and ethnic diversities have to be fully exploited if africa is to survive the second half of the twentieth century oddly enough many of the socalled african experts are postulating that tribalism and its intensity in africa are functions of education and that the more educated the african the more tribalistic he becomes this of course is a superficial generalization and total nonsense however we cannot deny the fact that some educated and corrupt africans tend to exploit the ethnic diversity in africa for their own selfish ends these selfish and unpatriotic demagogues have been partly repudiated by the present disruption in some parts of africa they will be totally disgraced when africans return to the philosophy that in part led to the political emancipation of africa this is the philosophy of zikism which as a package contains all the drugs that are capable of curing the present african illness and conglutinate all forces working for the good of africa zikism forms the core of what its exponents called renascent africa and is grounded on five postulates spiritual balance social regeneration economic determination mental emancipation and political resurgence renascent africa emerged in the latter s and grew into adolescence in the s it was given birth by the african youths whom dr james e k aggrey had prophesied would do the job dr aggrey saw the end of slavery in africa and also witnessed the beginning of modern education in that continent he foresaw a youth movement coming into africa that some day may startle the world said he this restlessness all over africa stands for selfdiscovery selfrealization it tells of power just breaking through the five zikist postulates will be examined separately to determine how they have been applied in the past and how they can be applied now and in the future as africa journeys toward her greater glory spiritual balance africa became a breeding ground of many missionary activities after the end of the slave trade needless to say these missionaries were and are stillchristians in many cases the missionary activities created conflicts and confusion there was conflict among various christian churches there was confusion between the christians the indigenous religious sects and islam at the heart of this confused state was the need for understanding the need to respect the views of others and the need for a liveandletlive attitude toward others these needs were to be met if africans in the process of being christianized and practicing christianity were to develop a spiritual balance divorced from the extremes and dichotomies of rightness and wrongness and therefore have the capacity to blend ideas for the purposes of progress rather than for the possibilities of self and socialdestruction it was only through this balance that africa would make yet another great contribution to the human race a contribution that dr blyden beautifully noted in a speech in when he said among other things africa may yet prove to be the spiritual conservatory of the world just as in past times egypt proved the stronghold of christianity after jerusalem fell and just as the noblest and greatest of the fathers of the christian church came out of egypt so it may be when the civilised nations in consequence of their wonderful material development shall have had their spiritual perceptions darkened and their spiritual susceptibilities blunted through the agency of a captivating and absorbing materialism it may be that they may have to resort to africa to recover some of the simple elements of faith for the promise of that land is that she shall stretch forth her hand unto god a very important element of the spiritual balance postulate is respect for the views of others in the field of religion in many parts of africa this respect has gained ground africans who were taught not to drink and eat in the houses of other religious groups have now learned to do the contrary and in many remote villages today it is not uncommon for catholics methodists anglicans and others to participate in harvests and bazaars and other common celebrations in the political field this respect developed but was later paralyzed by personality worship political jobbery and impatience politicians in their quest to become moneymakers and pose as the croesus of emerging africa became mean and intolerant in many african countries the leaders of opposition were recognized and paid out of the public treasury later some opposition members became prison targets and many of them crossed carpet either to avoid the myth and tag of the national enemies or on the pretext of adhering to one of the illdefined isms members of the opposition parties themselves were sometimes irresponsible and unpatriotic and therefore created doubt as to their abilities and sincerity to function as an alternate choice in the present state of affairs in africa the idea of spiritual balance should be made more practical by way of possible institutionalization it should be incorporated in civic courses and offered at all levels of education spiritual balance connotes sportsmanship statesmanship and the overall development of the individual and the society along a progressive continuum social regeneration social regeneration in the zikist context meant the detribalization of africa by africans africa has been naturally endowed with ethnic diversity which the slave trade exploited for a greater booty and which the berlin conference of distorted while engaged in what president leopold senghor of senegal called balkanization of africa the exploitation and the distortion left scars which are largely responsible for nigerians seeing themselves not as nigerians but as hausas ibos and yorubas ghanaians seeing themselves as fantis and gas and kenyans seeing themselves as kikuyus luos and kambas social regeneration called for what is ethical just and equitable when africans deal with themselves and with others and a total divorce from provincialism or localism the deadly weapon of tribalism as cities grew and be came laboratories of crossethnic diffusion and as communication facilities became widespread and relatively inexpensive detribalization became a must the penny press multitribal political parties and other organizations started to eradicate tribalism which was and still isa social vermin but the process of social regeneration dwarfed when cheap politicians started to preach the contrary when political leadership tended to decay when corrupt civil servants began to practice nepotism and turned their departments into family estates the process lost its tempo as some of the socalled african elite justified their crimes on tribal basis and evoked tribalism when confronted with the realities of justice honesty and duty furthermore the process was marred by religious fanaticism and the nostalgia of an empire that was long buried by the egalitarian wave that continues to blow on man and his conscience today social regeneration is another must for africa african educators must realize that it is one of the mature ingredients for peace progress and stability in africa the education of africans must therefore take it into consideration economic determination africa is the home of small farmers and petty traders these groups are well known for their rugged individualism and suspicion economic activities based on these characteristics are bound to stagnate and breed poverty and squalor the ethos of peasant farming and petty trading lacks effective bargaining position and is liable to fall as easy prey to foreign monopolistic economic activities economic determination in the zikist sense called for a wellgrounded and sound economic foundation for the development of african land labor and capital dr nnamdi azikiwe the leading exponent of zikism chided the africans for their psychological aversion to company formation and noted that the main reason for the difference between african and european business administration is the principle of cooperation the two words linked together mean working together azikiwe said further the european by pooling his financial resources together obtains a great capital with which to transact his business with this capital he gives employment to thousands he organizes branches of his business he makes important contacts he has good banking references and his business prospects are indicative of success if not in the immediate then in the remote future the african on the other hand prefers to work alone spending the greater part of his life in accumulating capital the african proceeds to control his business singlehandedly for a onemans business it works out temporarily but time will come when that one man will face problems which will require many heads to solve economic determination became a public policy goal in many african countries and had two main characteristics first the public sectors of these countries as members of the third world become the economic man and through the process of economic planning cooperation and coordination were required of all government departments second economic determination became the political catapult for launching the africanization process in the civil service in the private sector of the economy registered limited companies started to appear and with government aid and encouragement these companies achieved some degree of success some african businessmen got on the road to business modernization and were supported by indigenous banks which embarked on the policy of credit liberalization foreign private enterprises were persuaded to africanize their personnel or pack and go their commercial activities were limited to a certain segment of the marketing ladder and in some cases they were forced to accept african partnership training of indigenous personnel became a condition for new foreign enterprises planning to establish themselves in many parts of africa despite the above moves more has to be done to make economic determination a reality the cutthroat competition of many african petty traders and the proliferation that characterize some business activities a good example is rice milling in abakiliki eastern nigeria create excess capacities the call for economic cooperation has to be revived and people made to appreciate the wisdom of pooling resources to attain economic goals in the public sector the postindependence symbolic development must be halted and resources diverted to economic activities that are dynamic and capable of producing what gunnar myrdal called certain centrifugal spread effects of expansionary momentum from centers of economic expansion to other regions mental emancipation it is very common for some africans and some of the socalled africanists to overstate or exaggerate the african past for the simple sake of metooism it is even more common for the africaphobes to deny that africans ever had any history in fact as late as the s a british historian held that african history was nonexistent until the advent of the european overlords he wrote in part until the very recent penetration by europe the greater part of the african continent was without the wheel the plough and the transport animal almost without stone houses or clothes except for skins without writing and so without history this nonexistent thesis pervaded through the latter part of the th century but we do know that history is primarily made by people and has meaning because of its human content if africa ever had people they must have a history the existence of african history was further proved by the writings of such american scholars as w e b du bois and w l hansberry slavery the early missionary activities and later foreign domination at the doorstep made many africans think and feel that they were subhuman the painting black of the christian satan and the branding of things native as things diabolic led africans to develop fables admitting their own inferiority in the cameroons for example there is an old fable that tells how god created three sons a white man a black man and a gorilla while walking in the woods with his sons the gorilla and the black man got lost and god went on walking with the white man the zikists launched mental emancipation to educate the africans to have faith and confidence in themselves and all things african africans were told that biologically and otherwise they were equal to any other race in the world this revolution in thinking found expression in the writings of many african poets and people of african descent in the new world the latter spearheaded the search for racial identity and came up with the concept of the african personality while these writings became widely read in many african countries countries like nigeria came up with what the late mbonu ojike called bycott all bycottables the bycott doctrine stood for the glorification of african ways of life that were not inimical to african development it is in the arena of mental emancipation that zikism received its greatest response much to the dismay of the racists the average african now knows that he is a homme de bien this african realization must be exploited by african leadership in the building up of the continent political resurgence up to the midhalf of the twentieth century the african continent continued to be a political appendage of europe and was an important element of the european power struggle although the continent was a political football of european powers europeans held the view that africans were incapable of selfrule africans who had been educated in europe came back home as the noted beentos more english than the englishman and more french than the frenchman since they were assimilated as civilized natives they became strangers in their native land and parvenus of the learned clubs such acquired status enable those afroeuropeans to become assimilados in portugal notables evolues citoyens francais in france and hilldwellers of the british colonial administration having lost touch with their kind the afroeuropeans were politically paralyzed and incapable of questioning or fighting the status quo to this group of africans foreign domination was a datum and since they had been blessed to eat from the masters table the master had to be thanked and adored rather than attacked molested or alienated in short the group became totally blind to the lethargic pace of social economic and political development in africa and assumed a supine position and developed protruding stomachs the idea of political resurgence produced a dual attack on the po litical status quo first it called the africans attention to the fact that european hegemony was a recent phenomenon and not an act of god it demonstrated through various historical records that africans had enjoyed political independence in the past the existence of ethiopia atrophied the african servitude theory and the continued status of colonies as applied to africa was undemocratic unchristian and immoral second the zikists declared war on the african uncle toms then labelled old africa and called on the youths or new africa to wake up rise and shine at the early stage the political resurgence idea amounted to athanasius contra mundum to the colonial masters it was a minority agitation to the afroeuropeans it was reckless uncalled for and disruptive however the idea gained ground and the aftermath of world war ii coupled with the call for political freedom for all men everywhere added some form of exogenous factors to it there are now independent countries in africa each struggling with nationbuilding a journey which many countries all over the world are making or have made at one point in their history revive zikism the hysteria of political independence led to the drowning of zikism as a philosophy for political emancipation and nationbuilding the evolution of mushroom countries led to the establishment of local potentates surrounded by personality cults despite the fact that africa has become in the words of professor david finley a continent of conferences con tinental government one of the great dreams of zikism is as difficult today as continental government was in europe at the time of charlemagne in the face of african leaders perpetuating the colonial mentality african balkanization con m tinues as postindependence leadership in the african continent became internally corrupt and externally predatory a new wave of military regimes emerged young africans for whom colonial regimes are dim childhood memories are now finding themselves in a state of mental confusion because of the leadership vacuum that now prevails in many countries the situation is akin to what existed before the evolution of zikism thus the revival of the zikist philosophy is necessary and will provide african youths with a base for a further leap in the nationbuilding process revived zikism must be internalized by way of total domestication it should orient the youths to the noble task before them by teaching them the virtues of patriotism and the spirit of brotherhood duty and service since the original philosophy was dynamic and progressive its revived version should also maintain those attributes and should go all out to court and embrace not only the intellectuals and pseudointellectuals who parade the streets of lagos and nairobi but the total african society since zikism of the past had only access to the penny press the revived version should utilize all available communication media and should be incorporated as a complete course in civics for all african students in short efforts should be made to exploit the ideological content of zikism as a mobilizing factor in securing for africa and the africans a maximum developmental effort with a minimum of friction the two best known j r black artists in amerj j icacharles white and jacob lawrence charles white is by far the more popular it might even be said that charles white is to painting and drawing what langston hughes is to literature both men direct their art to primal human concerns to the simple problems and pleasures the ordinary joys and sorrows of the long journey from the cradle to the grave in his successful career as fulltime painter white like hughes has found favor and support among the black people who are his subjects more affluent collectors like harry belafonte and eartha kitt own one or more original works by white but thousands of ordinary people all over the country have for many years coveted the modestly priced reproductions which have been made available in art shops and book stores this spring for the first time a book devoted to charles white and his work has been published called images of dignity the drawings of charles white ward ritchie press the x a page volume contains photo reproductions of the artists drawings from an ink landscape executed in when the artist was seven to a charcoal representing black womanhood created especially as an ebony magazine cover in other features of the book are a foreword by harry belafonte who owns several white originals an appreciation by james a porter head of the department of fine arts and director of the art gallery at howard university and a long intimate perceptive commentary by benjamin horowitz owner of the heritage gallery in los angeles and the originator of the idea of the book of whites work the singer belafonte says there is a powerful sometimes violent beauty in his artistic interpretation of negro americana there is the poetic beauty of negro idiom this is the artists most profound contribution and it is significant that his art has never strayed far afield from the roots which gave birth to the artist himself in a period when many artists have deserted reality for the various schools of nonobjectivity and abstractionism mr white has continued to work for broader horizons of human expression and to explore deeper dimensions of truth and reality mr porter who is a distinguished artist in his own right says charles white is one of the great voices among those black americans who during the past i years have been the real interpreters of the american negro in this connection his oneman exhibitions have always been for me unforgettable events providing the highest opportunity for enlightenment through the revelation of powerful truths couched in a beautifully nuanced graphic poetry that unfailingly hits the mark indeed his art belongs not to one people but to all the world it is demonstrable that he has forged for himself an artistic language which transcends the boundaries set to art by a trivial subject matter or the shortlived vogue of social or political propaganda and mr horowitz says this in an era when the artist is expressing his detachment from the human condition by a cool and geometric style charles whites superb drawings challenge this lack of faith and selfinvolvement their epic quality affirms his deep concern for humanity his love of man and life and his belief that brotherhood is not just a catchword here on his canvasses the vitality and poignancy of humankind are captured for the eye to see and the heart to feel the artist who is part creek indian was born in chicago in he attended the burke elementary school where his interest in art was first aroused and later the chicago art institute school in the interim he also won two scholarships to local art schools but was rebuffed when he appeared to claim the scholarships he grew up during the depression and because of his talent was able to oin the famed works progress administration wpa art project where he remained for three years in along with a group of chicago artists he exhibited his work at howard university the other artists included archibald motley eldzier cortor bernard goss and charles sebree as a member of the arts and crafts guild he helped to organize the south side community art center during the late thirties and early forties whites work was exhibited in a number of cities and galleries and his reputation grew he also met and became friend or associate of a number of talented black people who were to make an impact on the cultural life of the nation among these were gordon parks katherine dunham gwendolyn brooks e simms campbell richard wright margaret walker theodore ward and willard motley in and white received rosenward foundation awards and in he finished the x feet mural at hampton institute which is one of his landmark works other white murals are in the chicago public library and at tuskegee institute a visit to mexico introduced white to that countrys artists the great david siqueiros among them and to the art of lithography he returned from mexico and lived for awhile in new york city where he met and was influenced by such artists as robert gwathmey and philip evergood and men like w e b du bois langston hughes and paul robeson he traveled in europe and returned to find that his reputation had grown even more in america the metropolitan museum of art exhibited his work in and his works were purchased by the whitney museum howard university and atlanta university for reasons of health white and his second wife left new york in and settled in the los angeles area where they now live frantz fanon s peau noire masques blancs black skin white masks first published in in french was made accessible to the englishspeaking public for the first time with the translated version brought out by grove press last spring this book will be of special interest to those already familiar with fanons the wretched of the earth grove press the collected body of fanons work all published originally in french is slowly becoming available in english though not in chronological order a brief resume may be helpful here peau noire masques blancs black skin white masks appeared in paris followed in by sociologie dune revolution lan v de la revolution algerienne published in translation as studies of a dying colonialism by monthly review press in the nowfamous les damne de la terre wretched of the earth made its original appearance in paris interestingly enough in there appeared posthumously in paris a collection of political and revolutionary writings scanning the period but with a preponderance of the articles written in the period pour la revolution africaine to be available in english in the fall of as toward the african revolution monthly review press if you have read his last and probably his most polished wretched of the earth you will now be able to look at his first serious fulllength statement of the whiteblack problem if this is to be your first experience of fanon you are fortunate to be able to take him up in chronological order for black skin white masks has a profoundly sincerely personal point of departure fanon published the book a young man of just after having completed his psychiatric training in an attempt to come to terms with the problem of racism and the deculturization and loss of identity engendered by it thus at the beginning of his career he had already blocked out what was to be his own special field of endeavor for the remaining ten years or so of his life in all serenity i think that it would be a good thing if certain things were said we read these words on the first page they are like the final line of the first stanza of a poem a minute or so further along we read this book should have been written three years ago but then truths were setting us aflame the underlying personal source is avowed from the beginning and a lyricism springs forth from these first pages which on occasion soars to the level of the poetic quest of man after his own nature his basic theme as the prefacer francis jeanson states is his own blackness his experience as a black man plunged into a white world the preface is from the original edition a postface was included in also by francis jeanson the purpose in the first case must certainly have been to break the shock for a largely white audience for fanons frankness is at times brutaland jeanson seems to feel obliged to justify the theme fully the postface portrays rather romantically fanons writings in terms of his beliefs with some reference to his lived experience the book proper is organized around an introduction in which fanon speaks in general terms of what he calls double narcissism the white who feels himself superior and the black who is bent on showing the white that he is his intellectual equal a vicious circle is then set up there appears to be no exit fanon suggests that only a psychoanalytical interpretation of the black problem can reveal the affective anomalies which are responsible for the complexual edifice he examines aspects of this complexual edifice in chapters dealing with the black mans attitude toward language the attitude of the woman of color toward the white man that of the man of color toward the white woman he gives his attention to the dependency complex of the colonized man then in an existential frame of mind and in a style reminiscent of the streamofconsciousness novel he turns to the thought processes and the emotional reactions of the black man being looked upon by a white world he is an object a stereotype fanon clearly prefigures his later writings in a chapter dealing with the negro and psychopathology then proceeds to examine whiteblack confrontation from adlerian and hegelian points of departure his last chapter is significantly en i titled by way of conclusion throughout the reader recognizes the environment in which fanons impressions and perceptions developed and matured the colonial west indies unproud humble in its underdeveloped status as a farremoved appendage of the glittering mothercapital the situation of the colonial student once in france coming face to face with white attitudesand white women the great majority of the examples and specific incidents are drawn from these two situations but the book is more than this fanon is writing after the emotional turmoil has subsided after the formalization of insight brought about by psychiatric training and unfolding before us we see a first attempt at a coherent statement of problem and causes a thought which starts other thoughts in motion a statement which is sometimes incomplete and sometimes hard to follow because the indirect statement of poetry and lyricism occasionally gives way to clinical style and an assumption that the reader is acquainted with technical and specialized literature but the statement remains dynamic inspiring ecause dancing behind it and luring us on we know there is an answer sensed but not yet attained peau noire masques blancs is a positive act and through its mere expression begins our bodily and mental liberation and weas did fanonfind ourselves free to question the quest and its lyric expression are sustained to the endthe morning star of elhajj malik shabazz arose in omaha nebraska forty years thereafter it descended in the dark chamber of a dark harlem ballroom malcolms fury on earth transformed the hopeless echoes of black nationalists into a sunset bust of flames in the way the story is told there existed in his cry the lost pride of africa malcolms walk through this century brought forth the image of high black kings and queens who knew the nile by sound and the sudan by sight poet lawrence p neal this curious but notable anthology of poetry for malcolm poems on the life and death of malcolm_x broadside edited by dudley randall and margaret burroughs beams a radiance few critics can dispute malcolms holocaust was a dramatization of our societys absurdity in dealing with people of african heritage malcolm died in the tradition of rare prophets these poems cover with clarity and honesty his career as a hustler prisoner muslim statesman and finally a moving spirit malcolm belongs to all ages he belongs to that feral voodooism which allows some men to seep through our fetid materialism he magnified through his words and deeds a royal alternative for doomed blacks he made marching middleclass blacks reexamine a white god and a black life he made a black god impossible and a white the editors have selected poems which treat malcolm as the prince of black manhood wordsworth said that poetry should speak of the man the malcolm one finds in this anthology is the christ one finds in the bible he is ghettorisen a philosophicaltragedy a soul brother a political seer a black christ weeping a denmark vesey urbanized a human thunderstorm more wretched than faceless waifs a song seeking melody why was he angry what made him an outlaw ossie davis brilliantly responds to those questions in his candid preface the poems in this anthology sprang forth from malcolms caravanserai they express malcolms brief life the mystery of his existence and the wry discontent of his distant drum beating out his seeds of wisdom and great argument and not even an hour has passed since malcolms death yet for an answer to his death we have no reply margaret danner in meditative response to malcolms spirit few black revolutionaries will venture into mississippis delta screaming for justice or upsetting the old order by virtue of its defiance and guns the spirit of malcolm whatever his life might have been honors and respects the ghosts goblins evil spirits fire clouds blackness that life is seemingly echoing from the ghetto to death we are caught in the opium of malcolms weeds his death diminished black manhood it is crowned by his upwardness near those final days of life the poets in this anthology sense the phantasy the hideous dreams in council with the man several poets seem to remember only one thing about malcolm his manhood for that which these poets loved most in malcolm seems clearer in his absence malcolms strange mixture of lights his exquisite negroness stripped of americana his islamic intuition and mass charisma comes through in the lyricism of this poetic requiem the interpenetration of negritude expresses itself in malcolms dialogue on earth the negro middleclass may miss the point since many of the conceptual images allude to the movement critics who dwell on the mellowness and softness of cullen and dunbar may not feel the ancient regime of stereotype subside to newer perceptions and feelings among todays black poets white poets like louis simpson will feel dismayed and left out not unless they now dance in the ballroom of malcolms truth simpson once believed the negro was incapable of creating good poetry there are poems in this volume simpsons talent could never bring forth dudley randall and margaret burroughs distinguish themselves by presenting new sophisticated voices angry voices anarchic bards but any real work of art must deal with the individual complexities of philosophy and life this book is a literary ghetto virgin one of many books that black people must publish themselves it is the most encouraging sign of black consciousness that ive witnessed lately the illumination of malcolms soul is so powerful that we must mark the pages for humanity for whoever touches this booktouches malcolm this is a book of truth as well as poetry this is malcolms aesthetic primer this is a black book malcolms soul is at rest bound by love and depression within these pages etheridge knight a first novel the last day of lin by gordon m williams is better coin charles stein day than could be deduced from the jacket blurb the author may have had his sights fixed on movie rights and the novel does have a cinematic documentary technique but it is still a better piece of work than the publishers imply in their lid off an english seaside town copy an american negro soldier chicagoborn and lonely gets drunk in a pub one night and vaguely remembers a woman the next morning a girl complains that she has been raped by a colored man and lincoln charless last day begins a brutal sergeant lovingly contemplates the time when charles will be at his mercy in the stockade the yearold boy starts forlornly to make a list of people who might help him but a contemptuous word from a cook corporal touches him on the raw he throws scalding coffee at his tormentor and crosses the line into violence as he ran between the wooden barrack huts of g squadron private lincoln charles shouted at bull krasko and all the other men who were his enemies shouted at them silently in his mind he knew exactly what he was going to do he was going to stop them once and for all from this point on private charles is lost and it is part of the authors achievement that as the long day wears on the tension never slackens seaton with its corrupt mayor its weak chief constable of police its ambitious frustrated newspaper men and the various dubieties surrounding the bathing beauty contest gives at the pressure points as charles with his carbine repeater ready proceeds on his hopeless quest for justice and revenge for a time like a drunk crossing a busy street he bears a charmed life but inevitably he dies on a deserted beach goaded beyond reason by the circumstances of his life and the stupidity ineptitude and cruelty of his fellow men it is an unsentimental novel and its subject is not a hero even though the end is violent lincoln charles is not the victim of a lynch mob he is destroyed by an indifferent selfprotecting society composed of the british facesavers and the american military machine gordon williams moves easily in the idioms of both countries and has cast his drama perceptively with characters who are credible and typical without being cliches that they are none of them likeable is scarcely surprising too often famous or infamous events of history are reduced to clashes between institutions and symbols even when the chief adversaries take on the guise of men they become institutions in the eyes of those who later attempt to explain what happened napoleon for example was a man and we partially know him as such it is also true that we know him as a typea symbol he is also to a very great extent an institution tana de gamezs the yoke and the star bobbsmerrill is a book that attempts to give us an understanding of the people involved in the cuban revolution of as personalities historical novels which is the genre of the yoke and the star have license to tell about a historical event without religiously adhering to the facts this same license allows the writer to give color and life to men and women involved who might otherwise lack these attributes missda gamez is not successful in either of the roles a successful historical novelist can play the book does not make the characters live as people but represents them as symbols and institutions also we are not provided with enough color or life in the characters to overcome the first deficiency the book is certainly not without points to recommend it we are provided with a glimpse of the kind of people who are necessary to execute the kind of event unfortunately this is too little to save the book itself the emphasis upon negritude in african writing in french inspired its countervailing force in its rejection by nigerian practitioners of their own sullen craft they with their ghanaian counterparts have for the most part resisted what they deemed a cultural imperialism an imposition from an alien source namely africans speaking french their reaction was epitomized by wole soyinka in his oftquoted remark to the effect that since the tiger does not stalk about crying his tigritude why then is it necessary for the negro to proclaim his negritude senghors reply in his howard university speech in september was scarcely calculated to inspire the reconciliation for which he is celebrated in so many words he laments that the brute saxons have evidently beaten an inferiority complex into their colonials cerebella let us only remark that whatever course the debate will take both writers possess imposing talents and will doubtlessly acquit themselves well soyinkas feeling however is shared by many others it has been expressed in a different sense by alioune diop one of the architects of the reconstruction of the african cultural edifice it is a sad thing diop has said to find it necessary to extol ones race at this historical juncture however in the century of the color problem it is a necessary task the world is emerging from its hierarchical vision of mankind and such evangelism is an inevitable stage through which the evolutionary process must pass soyinka however cannot accept what he seems to consider to be merely a forensic necessity his explanation reminds us of the first roosevelts injunction to speak softly but carry a big stick it seems after all it is this which is more akin to soyinkas intent than to reject as many think he has done the effort to recapture the african identity according to report soyinka in berlin in clarified his attitude it is true he said the tiger is silent on the subject but this does not mean he does not demonstrate a tigritude he lies in wait to pounce upon his prey and to perform a very specific tigritude similarly the implication is obvious negritude also though not proclaimed may be nonetheless a reality a consideration of soyinkas writing posed against the evangel of leopold senghor foremost articulator of negritude will not enable us to pin the former neatly on a map but perhaps to learn something of the terrain on which he stalks about comparison is made difficult by the fact that the two write in different media soyinka is essentially a playwright while senghor is a poet it is axiomatic that poetry lends itself more freely to the demands of the creative imagination senghor in writing a poem is not subjected to the same necessity of plot motivation of character etc although the difference impedes the contrast it does not totally obscure it our concern is with the presence in their work of an african inspiration which may be expressed although differently in either form the pervading tone of senghors work is one of faith an affirmation of faith in his continent his people and more broadly in mankind and in life itself his is a whitmanesque embrace of the other a pantheism finding the life spirit in all things as well as in being in every aspect of nature this pantheistic emphasis however is not indiscriminate the clearly evident and overwhelming love in senghors work is for his homeland and his people it is at once a personal and a very public poetry he retreats within himself to externalize in his essentially declamatory manner the traditional values of africa of old his is a work of nostalgia the nostalgia of exile of redemption of a fallen people affirming and celebrating their past greatness in the return of the prodigal son he returns to the land of his ancestors after the years of wandering in europe elephant of mbissel hear my reverent prayer give me the fervent learning of the great doctors of timbuktu give me the determination of soni ali son of the lions slavera tide race

is quickly evident that almost a generation separates the two writers an observer remarked in that as he examined the content of presence africaine he was far more interested in the cultural aspects of the african experience than in the voluminous embroilment in the unfolding political scene the editor replied however that the cultural life could not flourish until the political conditions to nourish it were achieved this preindependence struggle between africa and europe was a major influence in shaping the creative consciousness of senghor running as a dominant motif throughout his work is the counterpoint of color the conflict between africa and the west senghor is forerunner he announces the goal he proclaims a new vision he rejects the old western domination focusing upon the tensions inher ent in the struggle toward freedom in his choosing between isabella and soukeina for koras and balafong iii in his prayer to the masks in his poetic encounter with new york we see how his work is pervaded with an awareness of the conflict as professor in the lycee in tours and in paris he muses as he watches his fair students you my lambs my delight with eyes that shall not look upon my age i was not always a shepherd of fair heads on the arid plains of your books not always the good official deferring to his superiors the good colleague polite elegant with glovessmiling but rarely laughing old france old university all the old routine my lambs my childhood is as old as the world and i am as young as the everlasting youth of the worlds dawn the poetesses of the sanctuary have given me suck the kings griots have sung me the authentic legend of my race to the sounds of the high koras soyinka to the contrary evinces no concern over the clash between europe and africa the reader searches in vain for the evidence that soyinka is even slightly aware of what looms for senghor as an overweening cosmic rupture into i am black and you are white with perhaps one exceptionhis well known encounter with the london landlady one can simply wonder whether this absence of racial motif stems from conscious decision or from the natural direction of soyinkas creative impulse obviously his early creative years were not shaped as were senghors by the political issues that dominated preindependence africa the political struggle against britain had been conducted largely by the generation which preceded him his relatively brief student years at the university at leeds contrast sharply with two decades of senghors exile amid the sly silences of the european night soyinka appears centrally oriented toward an essentially african experience a sophisticated intelligence at home in either culture but obsessed with no pervasive sense of conflict between the two for soyinka negritude would be as the term negro in elijah mohammads theocracy an invention of the devil a name inspired by the raceconscious west in none of his plays nor evidently in most of his poetry is soyinka concerned with the conflict of europe and africa in a searching essay however entitled and after the narcissist appearing in the african forum spring soyinka makes the accusation that senghor declaims upon the african reality but fails to produce it senghors poetry he asserts falls short of achieving the wonders it celebrates remaining static and sterile in a narcissistic contemplation of the poet himself he accuses senghor of deception in that while purporting to celebrate the black poet and to glorify the african heritage he is in actuality indulging in an increasingly monotonous selfadulation he fails to achieve the animist awareness to transform the minutiae of experience into the word of a new psychic sensibility which according to soyinka is at the heart of the african poetic heritage the charge touches upon a basic aspect of the creative impulse and should help to illumine the differences between the two the essay is immediately noteworthy in the clarification it affords regarding what some have taken to be as we have indicated a rejection by soyinka of negritude and of the existence of a unique african sensibility the reaction to this cultural imperialism can be understood in large measure by the resentment more hinted at than made plain against a movement purportedly imposing canons of literary and psychic law to which the hopefuls of ibadan and accra would have to adhere the creative instinct being by definition largely a reaction against fiat the result should not have been difficult to foresee it is ironic that this cast in iron aspect of negritude a force conceived to remove the western cultural yoke was probably due in large measure to wellintentioned europeans who were among the earliest enthusiasts of an african renaissance their missionary zeal to carry the word beyond dakar appears to have inspired a counter force which seemed at first sheer apostasy but which now begins to reveal itself more probably as a nailing of an edict to the door at the mbari club the divinity at least in african concern is the same the road to redemption is different as to soyinkas charge of narcissism a preoccupation with the self is occupational with the poet and as soyinka himself agreed what otherwise might probably be termed narcissism is a frequent and likely form of affirmation in a literature of exploration and of rediscovery walt whitman could reasonably be considered vainglorious as he celebrates in himself a new universe of concern langston hughes insists that he too is beautiful and that he will too sit down at the welcome table as he pushes back limiting american horizons the poetry of irelands cultural rebirth contained what could be termed its own imaginative narcissism selfglorification can serve a purpose someone remarked that thousands of persons since nobody knows my name will never again look down at the dark face of a negro boy without for a second wondering whether the keen intelligence of a james baldwin is returning that gaze it is true that senghor is much concerned with senghor but in thrusting himself upon the world he has to a degree changed that world soyinka quotes the following passages from senghor characterizing them as deceptive claiming that under the guise of glorifying man and poet and of exploring the nature of poetry he is in reality paying increasingly ecstatic tribute to himself in a sequence of static communal concretions am not the rhythm it holds me still it carves all my body like a statue of baule it must be admitted however despite soyinka that both passages display a compelling lyric beauty and serve an esthetic purpose evident within the context of the poems in their entirety it is also apparent on the face of them that they aid in the labor of rediscovery they speak to the lines of david diop hey boy a chair a napkin a drink le temps du martyr it is curiousfrom the victim of the colonial experience would normally be expected a reaction of bitterness and resentment here the contrary seems to be the case it is soyinka who is lacerating in his mood not we have seen against the european but adventitiously in regard to any or all who might fall under his critical gazewithout regard to race creed or continental origin this corrosive strain does not mean soyinka is without humor some of the scenes in the trials of brother jethro and the lion and the jewel are hilarious even in the serious dance of the forests we have the old mans interesting and homely advice if the guest wont go quietly we must shout out the price of food but there is in these plays as in his others a caustic overview a ready corrosive wit swift to obey the playwrights ranging inclination to thrust and cut to the quick it is an effective talent adding sharpness and excitement even if it may impede in another dimension senghor of course is not witless his poetry simply lacks wit this is not to gainsay an extraordinary intellectual capacity and a rare ingenuity of argument evident in both his poetry and his prose wit borders on the cruel and excels in giving pain senghor evinces no such inclination this absence moreover is of a piece with the public and solemn character of his creative work addressed as it is not to the interior experience of the individual but in its essentially declamatory manner to europe and to mon peuple noir as anyone concerned with the public mood is aware intellectual agility is not the tool to touch the wellsprings of the collective will whether by conscious design or by virtue of the nature of his talent senghors work observes this restriction this particular contrast in the work of the two writers bears a relation to what is probably the most crucial area of comparison between the two as we have seen soyinka accuses senghor of making resounding and narcissistic public utterances celebrating and calling for what he senghor is unable to achieve to make manifest the true african sensibility the charge makes crucial obviously the nature of the poetic heritage of which soyinka speaks he appears to find it at root in the animist concept of the universe there is no rigid distinction between matter and spirit matter is infused with spirit and existence is a continuum of spirit inherent in an endless variety of material forms the african poetic labor is to transcend the superficial division and by and through the word to breach the threshold of that merger of spirit and matter wherein diversity becomes one there are similarities here of course with other cultures and the concept is reminiscent in the esthetic world of the more ambitious hopes of the fauves among the painters and earlier in the latter half of the nineteenth century the symbolist poets in france it is true however that while europe upon occasion has arrived at this point in its esthetic hadj it appears to have been inherent in the african vision since its remote and obscure origins it does appear to be accurate to say that senghors avowed and declamatory return to african traditions is in a sense a staking of a claim stopping short of its more profound exploitation he acclaims the rediscovery of the african genius he renounces the cramping tutelage of europe he invokes the tribal totems and in eloquent praise poems celebrates the old gods and the old customs however having conjured upand brilliantlythe african presence he does not complete the task it is left to others to work the mine field which he has opened and proclaimed senghors work which has been a pioneer labor is to wrest recognition of a valid african experience from the hostile soil of western imperialism this concern is foremost throughout his first three volumes chants dombre h os ties noires and chants pour naett it is present still in ethiopiques as more confidently he speaks as the representative of his reclaimed people at the same time however his tone is becoming ambivalent and like armattoe of the gold coast for the first time he perceives and laments defects in his hitherto idealized homeland and confesses his need for the brilliance and beauty of europe i have need of the maytime murmuring at montsouris of the splendour of the tuileries at the end of summer epitre a la princesse v in the same poem he finds he must lament in his letter to his princess of belborg that the land of my mother is not a noble land yes i know it is not a noble land for it belongs to the third day half water half earth my nobleness princess is to live that land according to that land one is reminded in a reverse parallel of how gauguin in a last painting as death approached in tropical tahiti created an utterly nostalgic portrayal of the snowcovered town in the france of his youth senghors poetic need has gone full cycle from the shifting vision sartre described in orphee noir in in which the pole pull of african desire had moved from kamchatka and the capitols of europe to the sundrenched cities of africa and again in nocturnes senghor has gone a step beyond not however toward an exploration of the african tradition he has acclaimed but into a personal meditative examination of the nature of poetry and other questions upon which he is reflecting soyinkas work provides a fruitful contrast nowhere does he engage in a similar nostalgic and idealized invocation of historic africa there is no tribute to africas past glory things african appear to find no more worthy an assessment in his caustic lexicon than europe or any other spot on the benighted globe the characters of his plays curse evenly both europe and africa past as well as present in both the road and a dance of the forests for example we are made aware of the horror of motor travel obaneji in the latter remarks another passenger lorry they call it the incinerator of the seventy people in it five escaped it overturned you see and the body was built of wood we learn the extended family institution is a decided nuisance rola this whole family business sickens me a pack of dirty yelling grandmas and fleabitten children in the swamp dwellers we see that agrarian life is burdensome and primitive riddled with fraud but flight to the city lagos results only in personal disintegration in the lion and the jewel soyinka derides both the old and the new while in the strong breed though working seriously to explore tribal traditions he implicitly makes the severest criticism of its inadequacies particularly in a dance of the forests do we learn that africas vaunted past is tyranny adenebi the accumulated heritage that is what we are celebrating mali chaka songhai glory empires but you cannot feel it can you and the scorned queen of medieval africa madame tortoise who has a special punishment for her disobedient warrior guards pay close attention to my words do eunuchs not fetch a good price at the market guard madame woman the victims wife have pity have pity madame tortoise to the warrior you are lost but have your wish warriors are sold as men but eunuchs guard the harems of other mata kharibus drooling on wares they cannot taste choose and the bereaved wife eight centuries later my knowledge is the hate alone the little ball of hate alone consumed me was it for this for this children plagued their mothers and the historian we were so near to the greatness of troy and greece mean this is war as it should be fought over nothing do you not agree these plays force our awareness that as suggested soyinka is doing what senghor is not he is working with the materials and in the context of the traditional africanframework to explore the fundamental questions of his society and more deeply of existence not that he produces decipherable answers he can be said indeed to have achieved obscurity the dimly perceived cast of characters wandering murkily about in a dance of the forests clearly leaves us certainly at first with a sense of a dimly perceived cast of characters wandering murkily etc we must confess of course that we are as probably the majority of soyinkas readers ignorant of the yoruba lore crucial to fuller comprehension and also not having had an opportunity to see the plays two excepted that we have merely read them yet more significantly it is evident that the playwright particularly i n a dance strong breed and the road is seeking to come to grips with the inner reaches of reality not in terms of western values but in utilizing the resources of a unique african culture that he may not completely succeed does not diminish the merit of the effort we are reminded of faulkners appraisal of thomas wolfe as the first among american novelists not because of his accomplished work which was uneven but because of the scope of his undertaking although in the article in question soyinka addresses himself largely to mr senghor in the process he reveals his esthetic concern and states his concept of the task of the african artist he cites his countryman the poet okigbo who he feels is able to achieve the moment of imagic separation in which the poet is relieved of his personal identity and merges in awareness with his vision the african animist knowledge of the oneness of the objects of ritual and ritualism of matter and psyche is in okigbo he states achieved it becomes clear that this is soyinkas search as his play unfolds as well as his preoccupation in some of his poetry in a dance soyinka works with the materials of the animist tradition aroni the lame one is in communication with the ancestors who are invited to send representatives to the gathering of the tribes from eight centuries of death the reanimated couple emerge not the illustrious forebears hoped for but accusers as we have seen who remind the living of the shame of an ignoble past it is evident that while soyinka condemns aspects of that past along with that modern triumph the automobile he continues to work within the framework of the tradition ogun the yoruba god with both destructive and creative proclivities evokes the master carvers who pass their spirit into the wood the dead characters speak of their previous lives in the animist concept of cyclic life renewal it is in the words of ritual in a dance of the forests that the dancer uncoils the chain that leads into the dead as the dirgeman calls for space for the dead to danceand after the eightcentury flash back we hear the words of the rites of the dead the halfchild the dead woman the spirit voices of things and finally those of the colony of ants soyinka may be ambivalent about the tradition but still he is working within the area of its assumptions probably nowhere more so than in a dance of the forests in the swamp dwellers his protagonists search leads him evidently to reject both the tribal old with its superstitious frauds as well as the decadence of the urban new strong breed however reveals again the strong sense of the personal quest of the author severely critical of the inhumanity of the carrier or scapegoat tradition and yet presenting a hero who will not flee but elects to suffer under the system he condemns in the road published in soyinka moves closer toward a modern concern both in the physical setting and in the philosophic quest of the professor whose dedication to the word has animist roots but who we are informed was a lay reader in the christian church here again we are aware of the centrality of ogun in soyinkas cosmology ogun that yoruba embodiment of good and of destructiveness appears properly incarnated in the professor the master forger who is suspect of even darker misdeeds and who at the same time is the earnest seeker after enlightenment a paradoxical character cynical derisive gloomy and faithful advocate of the word in his superb essay salutation to the gut soyinka repeats in another fashion his old theme describing how even at the table the pleasurepain dialectic is the path the gourmet must travel to culinary bliss it is evident throughout his work even in the hilarious trials of brother jethro in that rakish mockery of modernity the lion and the jewel and in that tour de force salutation to the gut soyinka is engaged in a quest with his artists tools he explores the obscure trails of the animist heritage explicitly concerned with the root questions of existence in contrast senghors appears a more secular verse while he celebrates the african tradition he does not in the sense of soyinka work within it yet a curious paradox suggests itself stemming in part from the different vision of the two writers senghor in his expository prose has previously addressed himself to the subject which soyinka treats in his creative works in senghors vision the heart of the african sensibility would not be found in the unfolding riddles of soyinkas dance or his strong breed but through the rhythmic invocation of the vital force not through soyinkas knowledge not in the theme but in the style and in the manner senghor has written what is rhythm it is the architecture of being the internal dyna mism which gives it form the sys tern of waves which it emits to the attention of others the pure ex f pression of the vital force rhythm it is the vibratory shock the force which through the senses seizes us at the root of being and in the negroafrican it is in the very degree to which he envelops himself in sensuality that the rhythm illuminates the spirit senghor would thus find the african access to illumination through rhythmic utterance through an m open participative approach to other things and other beings as contrasted with what appears to be a strong cerebral inclination of soyinka whose style here seems closer to the detailed analytical proclivity of the west it is in the manner of his approach says senghor rather than in the substance of his concern that the african sensibility is manifest it is his intensely emotional and intuitive nature which is the hallmark of the african personality if senghors conceptual assumptions are correct he may be more relevantly endowed by a capricious nature than is soyinka to achieve or to inspire the african poetic vision while it is not in senghors work that sounds the great bass drum of cesaire nor mounts the crescendo of david diops rama kam yet through his poetry moves though more muted a compelling and complex rhythm which would place him within the presumed african esthetic consider for example congo femme noise in stanza ix of for koras and balafong toko waly my uncle nuit de sine prayer to the masks in these poems senghor does not in the manner soyinka cites in okigbo undertake nor succeed in cracking a mystic sound barrier but soyinka cannot fairly deny the evocatory power for example of the last lines of congo quent poem though in the tradition of his culture could be the invocation of an essentially western muse there is in senghor visavis the gods of his origins a crisis of belief the question is posed whether he calls upon the sacred powers of old for the profane purposes of a western esthetic this appears also to be soyinkas accusation and would seem to have more substance than if made for example against birago diop of the famous souffles ecoute plus souvent les choses que les etres etc on the other hand to continue with senghors concept of the african psyche it is difficult to perceive a sense of rhythmic impulse in soyinka either in his drama or in his poetry he appears largely to be almost assertively disjunctive indifferent to rhythmic order even arrogantly awkward his quotation from okigbo suggests also his approach to poetic illumination has little to do with senghors concept of rhythmic invocation the highest sense of style evident in soyinkas work is neither in his plays nor in his poetry but in his essays witness salutation to the gut and after the narcissist itself the argument could be made that the obscure and convoluted unfolding of soyinkas serious plays would in senghors distinction between the discursive analytic west and the intuitive emotional participative africa range soyinka more properly in the former category if the african is as senghor urges essentially participative seeking to install himself sympathetically in the other rather than to analyze to dissect to dominate we look with little success for evidence of soyinkas african identity there is in his works little of the generous warmly emotional quality which appears to infuse senghors poetry public and declamatory as much of it is and if there is adulation in senghor it is not exclusively of the self his praise poems are in tribute to others as well both to things and to persons in soyinkas essentially melancholy vision there is small tribute to anyonethere are few instances of genuine positive emotion of joyous fraternity of human solidarity there are perhaps one or two exceptions fatherson and sonwife in the strong breed motherson in the swamp dweller but these relationships too are doomed and gloomily overcast with tragedy more consonant with his sardonic mood are the derisive observations of the professor in the road and his own invitation to the landlady in london soyinkas lacerating wit is scarcely the model of senghors concept of the contrapuntal progression through mutual sympathy to communion and merger let us observe here that remote as we are from the subject culture of the dispute we see as through a glass and must form opinion on the artists work without benefit of confrontation with either ogun or the dyoung dyoungs of dyilor there is the further issue raised by soyinkas charge the function of art itself there is ambivalence in soyinka but his belief is clear that the african poets role is to transcend the diversity of the secular world through the intermediary of the word to know and to participate in the spirit reality immanent throughout existence in the west there is a distinction between the aesthetic and the mystic illumination it is not clear that soyinka makes this distinction senghor apparently does and for the most part his poetry does not seek to achieve what soyinka decries as its lack it does seek in the western manner a similar esthetic moment in which as bernard berenson attests substance and form merge and esthetic recognition strikes the beholder in africa however the spirits are invoked by the carver and pass into the wood senghor much as western artists employ for secular purposes the symbols of a no longer unquestioned christianity addresses himself to the masks of the ancestors with a consciousness of europe and the cultural struggle he wages for his homeland soyinkas quest keeps him on the gloomy trail of ogun as he probes the riddles of existence of the blackest part of my soul across the zebra striping r of my mind surges this desire to be suddenly white i t i wish to be acknowledged not as black but as white s e nowand this is a form of recognition that hegel had not envisagedwho but a white woman can do this for me by loving me she proves that i am worthy of white love i am loved like a white man i am a white man her love takes me onto the noble road that leads to total realization i marry white culture white beauty white whiteness when my restless hands caress those white breasts they grasp white civilization and dignity and make them mine some thirty years ago a coalblack negro in a paris bed with a maddening blonde shouted at the moment of orgasm hurrah for schoelcher when one recalls that it was victor schoelcher who persuaded the third republic to adopt the decree abolishing slavery one understands why it is necessary to elaborate somewhat on the possible aspects of relations between black men and white women it will be argued that this little tale is not authenticated but simply that it could be born and survive through the years is an indication it is no fallacy for the anecdote renews a conflict that active or dormant is always real its persistence attests to the black worlds endorsement to say it another way when a story flourishes in the heart of a folklore it is because in one way or another it expresses an aspect of the spirit of the group in analyzing je suis martiniquaise and nini we have seen how the negro woman behaves with the white man through a novel by rene maranwhich seems to be autobiographicallet us try to understand what happens when the man is black and the woman white the problem is admirably laid out for the character of jean veneuse will make it possible for us to go much more deeply into the attitude of the black man what are the terms of this problem jean veneuse is a negro born in the antilles he has lived in bordeaux for years so he is a european but he is black so he is a negro there is the conflict he does not understand his own race and the whites do not understand him and he observes the europeans in general and the french in particular not satisfied with simply ignoring the negro of the colonies repudiate the one whom they have shaped into their own image the personality of the author does not emerge quite so easily as one might wish an orphan sent to a provincial boardingschool he is compelled to spend his vacations there his friends and acquaintances scatter all over france on the slightest pretext whereas the little negro is forced into the habit of solitude so that his best friends are his books at the extreme i should say there is a certain accusatory character a certain resentment an illdisciplined aggression in the long listtoo longof traveling companions that the author offers us at the extreme say but it is exactly to the extreme that we have to go unable to be assimilated unable to pass unnoticed he consoles himself by associating with the dead or at least the absent and his associations unlike his life ignore the barriers of centuries and oceans he talks with marcus aurelius joinville pascal perez galdos rabindranath tagore if we were compelled to hang a label on jean veneuse we should have to call him an introvert others might call him a sentimentalist but a sentimentalist who is always careful to contrive a way of winning out on the level of ideas and knowledge as a matter of fact his friends and schoolmates hold him in high regard what a perpetual dreamer you know my old pal veneuse is really a character he never takes his nose out of his books except to scribble all over his notebooks but a sentimentalist who goes nonstop from singing spanish songs to translating into english shy but uneasy as well as i was leaving them i heard divrande say to him a good kid that veneusehe seems to like being sad and quiet but hes always helpful you can trust him youll see hes the kind of negro that a lot of white guys ought to be like uneasy and anxious indeed an anxious man who cannot escape his body we know from other sources that rene maran cherished an affection for andre gide it seems possible to find a resemblance between the ending of un homme pareil aux autres and that of gides strait is the gate this departure this tone of emotional pain of moral impossibility seems an echo of the story of jerome and alissa but there remains the fact that veneuse is black he is a bear who loves solitude he is a thinker and when a woman tries to start a flirtation with him he says are you trying to smoke out an old bear like me be careful my dear courage is a fine thing but youre going to get yourself talked about if you go on attracting attention this way a negro shamefulits beneath contempt associating with anybody of that race is just utterly disgracing yourself above all he wants to prove to the others that he is a man their equal but let us not be misled jean veneuse is the man who has to be convinced it is in the roots of his soul as complicated as that of any european that the doubt persists if the expression may be allowed jean veneuse is the lamb to be slaughtered let us make the effort after having quoted stendhal and mentioned the phenomenon of crystallization he declares that he love for the simplicity of the negro is a myth created by superficial observers i love clarisse i love mme coulanges and it is andree marielle whom i really love only she no one else who is andree marielle you know who she is the daughter of the poet louis marielle but now you see that this negro who has raised himself through his own intelligence and his assiduous labors to the level of the thought and the culture of europe is incapable of escaping his race andree marielle is white no solution seems possible yet association with payot gide moreas and voltaire seemed to have wiped out all that in all good faith jean veneuse believed in that culture and set himself to love this new world he had discovered and conquered for his own use what a blunder he had made arriving at maturity and going off to serve his adopted country in the land of his ancestors was enough to make him wonder whether he was not being betrayed by everything about him for the white race would not accept him as one of its own and the black virtually repudiated him jean veneuse feeling that existence is impossible for him without love proceeds to dream it into being he proceeds to dream it alive and to produce verses when the question is put directly then the white man agrees to give his sister to the blackbut on one condition you have nothing in common with real negroes you are not black you are extremely brown this procedure is quite familiar to colored students in france society refuses to consider them genuine negroes the negro is a savage whereas the student is civilized youre us coulanges tells him and if anyone thinks you are a negro he is mistaken because you merely he knows that enraged by this degrading ostracism mulattoes and negroes have only one thought from the moment they land in europe to gratify their appetite for white women the majority of them including those of lighter skin who often go to the extreme of denying both their countries and their mothers tend to marry in europe not so much out of love as for the satisfaction of being the master of a european woman and a certain tang of proud revenge enters into this and so i wonder whether in my case there is any difference from theirs whether by marrying you who are a european i may not appear to be making a show of contempt for the women of my own race and above all to be drawn on by desire for that white flesh that has been forbidden to us negroes as long as white men have ruled the world so that without my knowledge i am attempting to revenge myself on a european woman for everything that her ancestors have inflicted on mine throughout the centuries what a struggle to free himself of a purely subjective conflict i am a white man i was born in europe all my friends are white there are not eight negroes in the city where i live i think in french france is my religion i am a european do you understand i am not a negro and in order to prove it to you i as a public employee am going to show the genuine negroes the differences that separate me from them indeed read the book again and you will be convincedmonsieur veneuse has native bearers he has a young negro girl in his house and to the negroes who seem downcast that he is leaving he feels that the only thing for him to say is please go away please go away you see how unhappy it makes me to leave you please go now i will not forget you i am leaving you only because this is not my country and i feel too alone here too empty too deprived of all the comfort that i need but that you luckily for you do not yet require when we read such passages we cannot help thinking of felix eboue unquestionably a negro who saw his duty quite differently in the same circumstances jean veneuse is not a negro and does not wish to be a negro and yet without his knowledge a gulf has been created there is something indefinable irreversible there is indeed the that within of harold rosenberg louist achille said in his report to the international conferences of insofar as truly interracial marriage is concerned one can legitimately wonder to what extent it may not represent for the colored spouse a kind of subjective consecration to wiping out in himself and in his own mind the color prejudice from which he has suffered so long it would be interesting to investigate this in a given number of cases and perhaps to seek in this clouded motivation the underlying reason for certain interracial marriages entered into outside the normal conditions of a happy household some men or some women in effect by choosing partners of another race marry persons of a class or a culture inferior to their own whom they would not have chosen as spouses in their own race and whose chief asset seems to be the assurance that the partner will achieve denaturalization and to use a loathsome word deracialization among certain people of color the fact that they are marrying someone of the white race seems to have overridden every other consideration in this fact they find access to complete equality with that illustrious race the master of the world the ruler of the peoples of color w we know historically that the negro guilty of lying with a white woman is castrated the negro who has had a white woman makes himself taboo to his fellows it is easy for the mind to formulate this drama of sexual preoccupation and that is exactly the ultimate goal of the archetype of uncle remus brer rabbit who represents the black man will he or will he not succeed in going to bed with the two daughters of mrs meadows there are ups and downs all told by a laughing goodnatured easygoing negro a negro who serves with a smile during the time when i was slowly being jolted alive into puberty i had the honor of being able to look in wonder on one of my older friends who had just come back from france and who had held a parisian girl in his arms i shall try to analyze this problem in a special chapter talking recently with several antilleans i found that the dominant concern among those arriving in france was to go to bed with a white woman as soon as their ships docked in le havre they were off to the houses once this ritual of initiation into authentic manhood had been fulfilled they took the train for paris but what is important here is to examine jean veneuse to this end i shall resort in considerable measure to a study by germaine guex la nevrose dabandon contrasting what she calls the abandonment neurosis which is preoedipal in nature to the real postoedipal conflicts described by orthodox freudians dr guex analyzes two types the first of which seems to illustrate the plight of jean veneuse it is this tripodthe anguish created by every abandonment the aggression to which it gives rise and the devaluation of self that flows out of itthat supports the whole symptomatology of this neurosis we made an introvert of jean veneuse we know characterologically or better phenomenologicallythat autistic thinking can be made dependent on a primary introversion me for the white race would not accept me as one of its own and the black virtually repudiated me that is precisely my position the attitude is one of recrimination toward the past devaluation of self incapability of being understood as he would like to be listen again to jean veneuse who can describe the desperation of the little hottentots whose parents in the hope of making real frenchmen of them transplant them to france too early from one day to the next they are locked into boarding schools these free joyful children for your own good as their weeping parents tell them i was one of these intermittent orphans and i shall suffer for it throughout my life at the age of seven i and my introduction to learning were turned over to a gloomy school far out in the country the thousand games that are supposed to enliven childhood and adolescence could not make me forget how painful mine were it is to this schooling that my character owes its inner melancholy and that fear of social contact that today inhibits even my slightest impulses m and yet he would have liked to be surrounded enclosed he did not like to be abandoned when school vacations came all the other boys went home alonenote that word alonehe remained in the big empty white school oh those tears of a child who had no one to wipe them he will never forget that he was apprenticed so young to loneliness a cloistered existence a withdrawn secluded existence in which i learned too soon to meditate and to reflect a solitary life that in the end was profoundly moved by triflesit has made me hypersensitive within myself incapable of externalizing my joys or my sorrows so that i reject everything that i love and i turn my back in spite of myself on everything that attracts me what is going on here two processes i do not want to be loved why not because once very long ago i attempted an object relation and i was abandoned i have never forgiven my mother because i was abandoned i will make someone else suffer and desertion by me will be the direct expression of my need for revenge i will go to africa i do not wish to be loved and i will flee from loveobjects that germaine guex says is called putting oneself to the proof in order to prove something i do not wish to be loved i adopt a defensive position and if the loveobject insists i will say plainly i do not wish to be loved devaluation of self indeed yes quences for one thing it keeps the individual in a state of profound inner insecurity as a result of which it inhibits or falsifies every relation with others it is as something that has the right to arouse sympathy or love that the individual is uncertain of himself the lack of affective selfvaluation is to be found only in persons who in their early childhood suffered from a lack of love and understanding jean veneuse would like to be a man like the rest but he knows that this position is a false one he is a beggar he looks for appeasement for permission in the white mans eyes for to him there is the other affective selfrejection invariably brings the abandonmentneurotic to an extremely painful and obsessive feeling of exclusion of having no place anywhere of being superfluous everywhere in an affective sense i am the other is an expression that i have heard time and again in the language of the abandonmentneurotic to be the other is to feel that one is always in a shaky position to be always on guard ready to be rejected and unconsciously doing everything needed to bring about exactly this catastrophe it would be impossible to overestimate the intensity of the suffering that accompanies such desertion states a suffering that in one way is connected to the first experiences of rejection in childhood and that brings them back in all their strength the abandonmentneurotic demands proofs he is not satisfied with isolated statements he has no confidence before he forms an objective relation he exacts repeated proofs from his partner the essence of his attitude is not to love in order to avoid being abandoned the abandonmentneurotic is insatiable that is because he claims the right to constant amends he wants to be loved completely absolutely and forever listen he is needed he is loved and yet what fantasies does she really love me does she look at me objectively one day a man came a great friend of daddy ned who had never seen pontaponte he came from bordeaux but good god he was dirty god how ugly he was this man who was such a good friend of daddy ned he had a hideous black face completely black which showed that he must not wash very often looking eagerly for external reasons for his cinderella complex jean veneuse projects the entire arsenal of racial stereotypes onto a child of three or four years and to andree he says tell me andree darling in spite of my color would you agree to marry me if i asked you he is frightfully full of doubt here is germaine guex on that subject the first characteristic seems to be the dread of showing oneself as one actually is this is a broad field of various fears fear of disappointing fear of displeasing of boring of wearying and consequently of losing the chance to create a bond of sympathy with others or if this bond does exist of doing damage to it the abandonmentneurotic doubts whether he can be loved as he is for he has had the cruel experience of being abandoned when he offered himself to the tenderness of others as a little child and hence without artifice jean veneuse does not however lead a life devoid of compensations he flirts with art his reading list is impressive his essay on suares is quite perceptive that too is analyzed by germaine guex imprisoned in himself locked into his artificial reserve the negativeaggressive feeds his feeling of irreparable loss with everything that he continues to lose or that his passivity makes him lack therefore with the exception of such privileged sectors as his intellectual life or his profession he cherishes a deepseated feeling of worthlessness where does this analysis lead us to nothing short of proving to jean veneuse that in fact he is not like the rest making people ashamed of their existence jeanpaul sartre said yes teaching them to become aware of the potentials they have forbidden themselves of the passivity they have paraded in just those situations in which what is needed is to hold oneself like a sliver to the heart of the world to interrupt if necessary the rhythm of the world to upset if necessary the chain of command but in any case and most assuredly to stand up to the world jean veneuse is the crusader of the inner life when he sees andree again when he is face to face with this woman whom he has wanted for months and months he takes refuge in silence the eloquent silence of those who know the artificiality of words and acts jean veneuse is a neurotic and his color is only an attempt to explain his psychic structure if this objective difference had not existed he would have manufactured it out of nothing jean veneuse is one of those intellectuals who try to take a position solely on the level of ideas incapable of realizing any concrete contact with his fellow man is he treated decently kindly humanly only because he has stumbled on some servant secrets he knows those people and he is on guard against them my vigilance if one can call it that is a safetycatch politely and artlessly i welcome the advances that are made to me i accept and repay the drinks that are bought for me i take part in the little social games that are played on deck but i do not allow myself to be taken in by the good will shown me suspicious as i am of this excessive cordiality that has rather too quickly taken the place of the hostility in the midst of which they formerly tried to isolate me he accepts the drinks but he buys others in return he does not wish to be obligated to anyone for if he does not buy back he is a nigger as ungrateful as all the others is someone mean it is simply because he is a nigger for it is impossible not to despise him well it is clear to me that jean veneuse alias rene maran is neither more nor less than a black abandonmentneurotic and he is put back into his place his proper place he is a neurotic who needs to be emancipated from his infantile fantasies and i contend that jean veneuse represents not an example of blackwhite relations but a certain mode of behavior in a neurotic who by coincidence is black so the purpose of our study becomes more precise to enable the man of color to understand through specific examples the psychological elements that can alienate his fellow negroes i will emphasize this further in the chapter devoted to phenomenological description but let us remember that our purpose is to make possible a healthy encounter between black and white jean veneuse is ugly he is black what more is needed if one rereads the various observations of germaine guex one will be convinced by the evidence un homme pareil aux autres is a sham an at tempt to make the relations between two races dependent on an organic unhealthiness there can be no argument in the domain of psychoanalysis as in that of philosophy the organic or constitutional is a myth only for him who can go beyond it if from a heuristic point of view one must totally deny the existence of the organic the fact remains and we can do nothing about it that some individuals make every effort to fit into preestablished categories or rather yes we can do something about it earlier i referred to jacques lacan it was not by accident in his thesis presented in he violently attacked the idea of the constitutional apparently i am departing from his conclusions but my dissent will be understood when one recalls that for the idea of the constitutional as it is understood by the french school i am substituting that of structureembracing unconscious psychic life as we are able to know it in part especially in the form of repression and inhibition insofar as these elements take an active part in the organization peculiar to each psychic individuality as we have seen on examination jean veneuse displays the structure of an abandonmentneurotic of the negativeaggressive type one can attempt to explain this reactionallythat is through the interaction of person and enviromentand prescribe for example a new environment a change of air it will properly be observed that in this case the structure has remained constant the change of air that jean veneuse prescribed for himself was not undertaken in order to find himself as a man he did not have as his purpose the formulation of a healthy outlook on the world he had no striving toward the productiveness that is characteristic of psychosocial equilibrium but sought rather to corroborate his externalizing neurosis the neurotic structure of an individual is simply the elaboration the formation the eruption within the ego of conflictual clusters arising in part out of the environment and in part out of the purely personal way in which that individual reacts to these influences just as there was a touch of fraud in trying to deduce from the behavior of nini and mayotte capecia a general law of the behavior of the black woman with the white man there would be a similar lack of objectivity i believe in trying to extend the attitude of veneuse to the man of color as such and i should like to think that i have discouraged any endeavors to connect the defeats of jean veneuse with the greater or lesser concentration of melanin in his epidermis this sexual myththe quest for white fleshperpetuated by alienated psyches must no longer be allowed to impede active understandingin no way should my color be regarded as a flaw from the moment the negro accepts the separation imposed by the european he has no further respite and is it not understandable that thenceforward he will try to elevate himself to the white mans level to elevate himself in the range of colors to which he attributes a kind of hierarchy we shall see that another solution is possible it implies a restructuring of the world russell payton leaned r y his shovel against the side of the grave he stretched his body and pressed the palms of his hands against the lower part of his back the sun directly overv n f n v m v head beat down on his shoulders pushing his hat to the back of his head he daubed his wet forehead with an already sodden handkerchief and stood for a moment squinting up out of the hole at the bluewhite september sky a hawk circled high in the air then glided out of sight from a nearby cornfield he heard an insistent bobwhite bobwhite as his lips puckered to whistle an answer to the bird a dragonfly darted down into the grave whirred around him then lighted atop a mound of the fresh red dirt its transparent wings fluttering and shimmering in the sun he snatched up a clod of dirt and flung it at the dragonfly mumbling is everything okay mr snake doctorsir does all this suit you turning he picked up his shovel and measured the length of the grave then used his own six foot frame to judge the graves height the edges were well over his head he grunted in satisfaction tossed the shovel up out of the grave then scrambled out himself he laid the shovel across his shoulder and tramped down the hillside to where his old ford pickup truck was parked alongside the dirt road as he guided his truck onto the road he glanced back up the hillside at the patch of gray crooked tombstones and the one dark gaping hole surrounded by piles of red clay the sign hanging over the baggage platform of the grimy gray and black ic railroad station proclaimed winnesoga miss pop as russell payton shifted his truck into reverse and backed it up to the platform three ancient black men smoking and lounging on the empty railway express wagon got slowly to their feet and slouched over to the edge of the platform one of the ancients taking his pipe from his mouth said hidee russ hidee todays the day aint it russell payton slammed the door of his truck and jumped up on the platform howdy mr lucius howdy yawll yeah todays the day is the twelvethirtyfive on time yep shes on time all right lucius said proudly just checked with mr lasley at the window a little while ago he ceremoniously extracted a large watch from the bib pocket of his overalls and peered at it she should be coming round the curve yonder in about fifteen minutes russell nodded and lifted his hand to the men then crossed the platform and entered the door of the station marked colored he paused in the doorway letting his eyes adjust to the dimness of the small room the four highbacked benches facing the fat unfired stove and the six stools at the little lunch counter in the far corner were empty in the center of the floor a brownstained spittoon was being explored by a dozen flies overhead the ceiling fan hummed lazily and from beyond the ticket window the cricket like clicks of the telegraph keys unsettled the quietness he crossed to the lunch counter slid onto a stool and pressed the little bell atop the counter hello russ howre things going with you i was hoping youd stop in before train time russell looked up at a dark brown skinned woman wearing a starched blue dress and a small white apron who had come out of the adjacent kitchen he was suddenly conscious of the sweat and dirt that streaked his clothes and face he smiled diffidently im okay mae he said howre you the woman lowered her eyes and shrugged her shoulders she began to wipe the counter and to adjust the salt and pepper shakers can i get you anything russ pepsi the woman returned with the drink placed it in front of russell and began to wipe the counter again suddenly she stopped and leaned across the counter the tips of her fingers touching russs arm her wide dark eyes were moist russ i know your mama and billy joe are bringing t g home today and i want to come to the funeral i know your mama partly blames me for t g leaving and she and she probably wont appreciate me comingbut i want to see him russ i want to see his face again before they put him in the ground what do you think huh think your mama raise cain if i come russell curled his fingers around the cold bottle lifted it to his mouth and took a long swallow in the first place mae aint no body gonna see tgs face he said the box aint gonna be opened but why not russell raised his voice slightly have you ever seen anybody after theyve been electrocuted well no me neither but i read about it and it aint pretty i mean when they burn you they burn you and then they just embalm you and lay you in a wooden box to be buried by the state if anybody dont claim your body and we barely scraped together enough money to bring tg home aint none left to lay him out fancy so aint nobody gonna see him as he firmly set the drink down he felt the womans fingers tighten on his arm she said even so russ i still want to come but what about miz payton when she and billy joe caught the train here last monday she barely spoke to me he said itll be okay to come tomorrow mae mama aint gonna say nothingbe too many people around and well hell everybody know tg left here cause the law was after him and not on account of you and the boy yeah but he got into that fight with the sheriff cause he was drunk and he got drunk cause i told him i was pregnant and he thought i was trying to force him russell saw a tear trembling in the corner of her eye and said quickly how is the boy mae the woman brightened she flashed a quick smile exposing white teeth and sending the tear weaving down her cheek oh hes finehes fine he started in school this year you know dont seem like its been that long since tg left i betcha hes growed a foot since you last saw him russ billy joe comes to see him and me all the time why dont you well mae you know how it is been working a bell tinkled behind the woman from beyond the swinging door of the kitchen she raised up off the counter looked over her shoulder then back at russ be back in a minute she said smiling an apology you know how it is when the white folks call us niggers gotta come as she disappeared through the door russ glimpsed a row of white faces at the lunch counter in the white waiting room he picked up his drink turned on his stool and leaned back against the counter when the white folks call us niggers gotta come he rubbed the cold bottle against his face and chuckled not tg he thought not highstepping loudlaughing tg crap tg wouldnt come even when his own daddy called not even when his own daddy lay dying and calling for him a little over two years ago russell shifted the cold bottle to the other side of his face and stared out through the dirty flyspecked window at twin steel tracks remembering how they had whined underneath him as they sped him to chicago to find tg and bring him back to his daddy he was tired and short tempered when he knocked on tgs door the train ride to chicago had been long and the elevated ride to the south side confusing he didnt like the hard noisy chicago night he didnt like the dim cluttered foulsmelling hallway in which he was now standing he didnt like having to leave home while his daddy lay dying he pounded on tgs door okayokay hold tight im coming the door inched open a cautious eye peered out from the darkness yeah who is it its me tg open the damn door the eye blinked then widened and the door swung open russ russ whatre you doing here man come in come in russ moved past tg into the middle of the room stopped and turned extending his hand toward tg in the dimness he saw tg keeping his right hand concealed behind him quickly edge along the wall to a bureau in the corner of the room he heard a heavy thud as he saw tg lean against an open drawer then close it turn on your lights tg russ said what the hells the matter with you tg clicked on the lights dressed only in his underwear and barefooted he advanced and stuck out his hand they embraced awkwardly and stepped back smiling sheepishly at each other russ looked at his brother at the receding hairline and the whiskeyreddened eyes at the wide mouth now curling upwards in a grin at the tall underfed looking body that now shifted nervously in the center of the room and anger welled up in him he clamped his teeth together and jerked his eyes away from his brother and looked around the room they swept past the bare wall and single chair past the bureau lined with whiskey and wine bottles and halted at the bed where a woman huddled under a blanket her hair in disarray her eyes heavy with sleep tg looked from russs face to the bed and laughed he waved russ to the chair and said wait a minute brer ill get rid of her and then well talk he crossed to the bed and shook the woman roughly cmon get up he said go somewhere and come back later me and my brers gotta talk what is this the woman said what the hell russ said let it go tg we can go someplace else oooh no tg laughed shes getting up and getting out of here he reached for the blanket that the woman clutched under her chin russ stood up quickly and turned his back to the bed trying to ignore the torrent of hot words flowing between tg and the woman he wandered over to the bureau picked up a bottle of whisky tumbled some into a glass and took a swallow attracted by a flicker of light he glanced downward in an almost closed drawer he saw a silver plated pistol glinting coldly and menacingly on a pile of rumpled shirts like a coiled rattler sunning on a pile of rocks a chill swept over him and he felt the muscles tighten across his shoulders he twirled the glass in his hands his mind conjuring up fearful pictures of tg and the gun he was unaware that the woman had slipped out of the room until he heard tgs laughterfilled voice he wheeled around and said cmon tg pack your stuff were going home tg flopped across the bed laughing now hold tight brer i aint going noplace whatre you talking about anyway didnt you get my letter naw well i wrote and told you to come home right away daddys hurt tg he was plowing for mr campbell and fell off the tractor hes well the doctor says he wont last long and he wants to see you so cmon start packingtg rose from the bed and crossed to the bureau he picked up a bottle of whiskey tilted it to his lips and took the bottle back to the bed with him tell me russ he said hows mama and billy joe theyre all okay and mae and your little boy is too now lets go we can talk about em on the way home tg took a long drink from the bottle and laid back across the bed with the bottle resting on his bare chest he stared up at the ceiling and said softly that mae shes okay i guess shes pretty mad at me huh i guess shes pretty mad at me about the baby and everything huh he made circles on his chest with the bottle russ stood up abruptly cmon man i told you wed talk about it later cant you understand daddys dying he might even be dead already brer you know i cant go back down there what about that sonnuvabitching sheriff i beat the hell out of uhuh not me i aint fixing to go to nobodys jail never daddy got the sheriff to drop that warrant on you over a year ago i told you about it in the letter tg laughed you think id trust that sheriff you think hes gonna forget about that whipping this nigger gave him uhuh brer i aint going he raised the bottle to his lips again youre going all right even if i have to drag you russ said he strode across the room to the partly open door of a closet and flung it open he rummaged in the darkness and found a battered suitcase hurling it into the center of the room he began to jerk clothes from the racks he stalked back into the room and pitched the clothes on the bed start getting dressed he ordered tg sat up on the bed didnt you hear me man i told you i aint going whats the matter with you tg russ shouted taking a step toward tg and fighting down his anger stop acting like a fool whats the matter with you suddenly tg scooted back to the middle of the bed and stood up his feet disappearing in the softness of the mattress his laughter bouncing off the walls the bed springs protested at the sharp weight and for a second he reeled on his unsteady foundation his bare chest heaving his bare legs trembling gripping his shorts with one hand he pointed the whiskey bottle at russ with the other whats the matter with me well ill tell you nothings the matter with me nothing the whole thing is nothing me wanting to see daddy aint nothing him wanting to see me aint nothing him dying aint nothing home aint nothing mama and billy joe and mae and the boy aint nothing he took a tottering step to the edge of the bed and bent over resting his palms on his knees he shoved his face into russs and said you know why aint nothing nothing brer cause i aint nothing and you aint nothing and russ slapped him hard tg fell back across the bed the whiskey bottle spinning out of his hand and crashing on the floor as russ grabbed for him tg twisted out of his reach and bolted for the bureau he jerked the the drawer open and whirled with the pistol glinting coldly in his hand as russs fist cracked against his jaw sending him crumbling to the floor russ stooped over and picked up the gun then went to the chair and sat down breathing heavily limply holding the pistol he gazed at tg trying to sort out his thoughts and stifle his anger this was tg his brother this was tg who used to make the house ring with laughter who could even tease chuckles out of his usually somberfaced mama this was tg who billy joe adored dogging his tracking all over the farm this was tg his highstepping big brother russ felt the tears streaming down his face and swiped at them with the back of his hand as he dimly watched tg struggle to his feet are you going tg he asked softly lets go home man and forget all this tg shook his head and grimly laughed as he stumbled to the bed i already done told you russ i aint going russ got up walked over to the bed and stood looking down at tg he shook his head slowly from side to side i just dont know he said i just dont know all i know is im going home he tossed the pistol down beside tg and turned starting for the door he opened the door and looked back his mouth forming a last plea tg was sitting crosslegged in the middle of the bed with the pistol stuck in the waist band of his shorts his eyebrows were arched his lips curled upwards his eyes flashed mocking sparks he said aint nothing nothing brer russ closed the door and started down the narrow hallway he had to get home he wouldnt tell them what had happened hed tell them that tg had moved and couldnt be found hey russ its just about train time she oughtta be coming round the curve anytime now bringing tg home russ smiled at the old black man who had stuck his head in the waiting room door okay mistah lucius ill be right out but he still waited at the lunch counter wanting a last word with mae who had gone to serve some white folks in the other waiting room she had been tgs girl and he wanted to assure her that it would be all right for her to come to the funeral it had been she trembling and crying who had shown him the copy of a chicago negro newspaper whose headlines shouted copkiller to die in electric chair tonight below the headlines was a picture of tg with his head thrown back and his teeth flashing russ frowned erasing the picture from his mind deciding not to wait any longer for mae he rose from the stool and went through the door out into the bright mississippi afternoon he squinted down the railroad tracks the signal light had changed from green to red a motley crowd slightly larger than that of the towns regular trainmeeters had gathered on the platform like cattle shifting in the wind they turned looking obliquely at russ he brushed ineffectually at the dirt on his clothes and moved away from the people squatting on the edge of the platform out of the corner of his eye he saw the old man lucius approaching the old man sat down beside russ with his feet dangling over the platform edge they both sat silently looking down the tracks a car with a red light on top wheeled off the street and swung into a parking space near the platform the car door opened and the sheriff got out and headed for the platform suddenly the rails began to hum and pop from around the curve the train appeared like a large red and black caterpillar steadily growing larger russ jumped down from the platform and walked around his truck he checked each tire kicking it viciously there has never been t a free people a free country a real democracy on the face of this earth in a city of some slaves and socalled free men plato sat down and praised freedom in exquisitely elegant phrases in a colony of slaves and thousands of white indentured servants thomas jefferson a wealthy slaveowner sat down and wrote the memorable words of the declaration of independence in a country with million secondclass citizens and millions on millions of povertystricken whites woodrow wilson segregated the toilets in washington d c and went forth to make the world safe for democracy there has never been a free people a free country a real democracy in the recorded history of man the great masses of men have always lived in suburbs of hell the great masses of men and almost all women have always been anvils for the hammers of the few we have gathered therefore to talk about a subject which has no past insofar as mankind is concerned and which can have no future unless it is visualized and made concrete in the body of mankind and it seems to me that one forfeits the right to talk about freedom unless one is prepared to face that fact and to do something about it almost years ago at a time of revolutionary turbulence not unlike the present tom pane held that unpalatable tfruth up to the unseeing eyes of his contemporaries freedom he sid hath been hunted aribund the globe cd receive the fugitive and prepare in time an asylum for mankind today after a thousand evasions after a thousand proclamations and manifestoes freedom is still a fugitivein america as well as in russia in portugal as well as in angola in england as well as in rhodesia in boston as well as in mississippi we live in a world where twothirds of the people are hungry we live in a world where most of the peoples are diseased and illiterate in such a world who has the effronterywho has the gallto praise the state of freedom the whole problem of freedom in the white and nonwhite worlds must be placed first in this larger context for henceforth it will be impossible to speak of freedom in terms of the concerns of the tiny minority of men who live in europe and north america we must note moreover that freedom in western europe and north america is abstract negative and largely illusory and even in these areas millions live on the edge of despair and millions more are slaves to their skin or to their omnivorous machines it will be my argument here that the truth of freedom in the world is the truth of the truly disinherited and by that i mean that the state of freedom is most accurately reflected in the lives of the men on the bottom the men on the top and the men in the middle can remain ignorant of what they do and of what they are but the men on the bottom experience the truth of society irremediably they are the truth of every society in them we can see what we are and what we have become in the mirror of their eyes we can measure the depth of our alienation from freedom and from man to be even more explicit and to bring the matter closer to home i intend to maintain here that racism is the best index of the failure of american society to create a human and equitable society for white people my argument here is the very simple one that the depth of racism is a measure of the unfreedom in the white community and from that premise we can conclude that black men are not free because white men are not free and by all this we must understand that when the emancipation proclamation finally comes it will be most of all an emancipation of white people from the fears and frailties that cruelly twist and goad their lives before pursuing that argument let us pause for a moment and examine the meaning and implications of the word that everybody praises and few people live as we all know freedom lends itself to numerous interpretations in the white western world it is usually defined negatively as freedom from this definition finds its truth in certain abstract liberties freedom of speech freedom of association et cetera to define freedom thusly and to stop there is in my opinion a perversion of freedom for freedom also means freedom to and this positive definition finds its truth in concrete possibilities created in the social field in the right to work in the right to eat in the right to shelter in the right to be there is still another definition of freedom a psychological one which stresses the act of willing or choosing and this definition in turn is linked to a fourth one which contends that manby his ability to rise above or transcend a situation any situation by his ability to say no is the measure and the meaning of freedom in the world in my opinion no definition of freedom is adequate in todays world which does not embrace all these meaningsfreedom from freedom to transcendencein a concrete context linked to conditions that open or close real possibilities to concrete men in their social and historical situation such a definition would recognize the existentialist truth that man is freedom and would recognize that the alienation of the world from freedom is a measure of its alienation from man and the possibilities of man it would also recognize the truth that man has not yet been created and that the creation of manblack man as well as white manawaits the winning of real concrete freedom for all men here and there across the great wastelands of time little knots of men have glimpsed the terrifying possibilities of that paradox i think particularly of african village democracy and other free forms developed by american indians and other communal groups but these groups were hemmed in by material limitations and it was left to western europe to free man from feudal restrictions and to hoist high the standards of individuality and personal autonomy but europe in its lunge toward freedom made three fatal errors first of all and most important of all europe experienced its newfound freedom as the untrammelled exercise of the ego and in pursuit of the goal of possessive individualism it drew a circle around itself excluding and enslaving threefourths of mankind second out of sheer terror europe cut freedom into two parts separating man into positive and negative poles the mind and the body reason and emotion sex and the soul refusing to recognize the full force of freedom which manifests itself in sex as well as in prayer europe facilitated that manic process by which men project their rejected freedom onto the scapegoats and outcasts of society in the third place europe refused to admit the full logic of its own idea with few exceptions europeans and the sons of europeans found it difficult to extend the idea of freedom to poor whites and impossible to extend it to nonwhites in europe and in the extensions of europe freedom became a function of the skin and of property despite the huge achievements of european technology and science european freedom beautiful as it was was not freedom or better still it was not yet freedom having freed man from arbitrary restraints europe stopped halfway leaving man tied to the chains of caste class and passion having expelled man from his tribal and feudal eden europe retreated in terror from nietzsches lucid question not free from what but free for what america inherited europes immense achievements and its immense failuresand extended both the history of america like the history of europe has been a history of a magnificent evasion of the multiple meanings of freedom the most obvious example of that failure is the black american but the failure to integrate black people into the american community is only a part of our cultures general inability to create a just and human environment despite our alleged affluence to million americans many of them white live in abject poverty and millions more live lives of harrowing economic insecurity despite our extraordinary mechanical ability which cannot be praised too highly we have failed to create a truly human community machines are more real here than human beingsand vastly more important in a society of machines by machines and for machines we are increasingly powerless and a nihilistic individualism has made conformistsand cowardsof us all dehumanized depersonalized distracted by bread and television we have almost lost sight of man mystified by an ethic which confuses the verb to be with the verb to have we try to staunch the running wound of our lives by adding layers and layers of mechanical bandaids we lack passion we lack purpose and we decide nothing the great alternatives are formulated by others and in our name and without our assent men women and little children are killed in povertystricken countries increasingly irresponsible as our choices become fewer and as the world becomes more threatening we whirl around and in a materialistic inferno between collective madness and collective selfdestruction and we are afraid we are afraid of our neighbors of negroes of chinese of communists of fourletter words sex fluoridationwe are afraid in a word of ourselves because we fear ourselves and others because we are dominated by machines and things because we are not in control of our destiny we are neither happy nor free if one probes beneath the chromeplated surface senator j w fulbright says he comes inescapably to the conclusion that the american people by and large are not happy i believe that americas trouble is basically one of aimlessness at home and frustration abroad as you have probably guessed by now i believe americas trouble is at a deeper level the problem in my opinion is structural that is institutional we have not created a single community here we have not even created a single community for white people men tell me that white people ought to love black people but it is clear to me that white people dont love each other not to speak of the fact that an incredibly large number of white americans dont love themselves racism in america is a reflection of this structural problem as i have said elsewhere we misunderstand racism completely if we do not see it as a confused and alienated protest against a suffocating reality on the level of power racism is used by men to effect magical solutions of the unresolved social problems in the white community on a personal level particularly among lowerincome and middleincome whites racism is an avenue of flight a cry for help from desperate men stifling in the prisons of their skins viewed in this perspective racism is a flight from freedom a flight from the self a flight from the intolerable burdens of being a man in a mechanized world there is considerable evidence that americas stress on possessive individualism induces exaggerated anxieties which are displaced onto the area of race relations the fear of failure the fear of competitors the fear of losing status of not living in the right neighborhood of not having the right friends or the right gadgets these fears weigh heavily on the minds of millions of americans and lead to a search for avenues on the escape and so the factory worker or the poor farmer who finds himself at a dead end with a nagging wife a problem child and a pastdue bill uses the black man as a screen to hide himself from himself and from an intolerable reality to adapt the perceptive words of richard wright social discontent assumes many guises and the social commentator who focuses on the police blotter misses the real clues to contemporary reality by this i mean that it is possible to know before it happens that certain forms of violence will occur it can be known before it happens that a native bom american educated healthy with a pretty wife a splitlevel house and two cars with all the abstract liberties but devoid of basic human satisfactions will seize upon a powerless black man and derive deep feelings of pleasure from hacking him to death with a chain but as wright said to know that a seemingly normal ordinary american is capable of such brutality implies making a judgment about the nature and quality of our everyday american experiences which most americans simply cannot do for to admit that our individual experiences are of so low a quality as to preclude the deep organic satisfactions necessary for civilized peaceful living is to condemn the system that provides those experiences the real question in america is how we build a society in which apparently normal people do not need scapegoats or whipping boys to build their egos and to maintain their dignity how can we build a society that will enhance freedom and integrity and obviate the need for racism first of all we have to condemn the system and we have to condemn the system in the name of that america of that commonwealth of silence which was written which was promised and which has never existed i am suggesting here that we must initiate a sustained dialogue on the foundations of our society and we must demand the right to subject every institution to the claims of freedom let me say immediately that i dont have all the answers the only thing i know is that everything must be rethought again we need a new definition of work embracing any act of value that a man brings to society and a new definition of politics embracing the full and effective participation of all men in formulating the alternatives and choosing between the alternatives of the political economic and social decisions that affect their lives we also need a new definition of sex which would free women for equal roles in the church in labor unions in the professions and every other institution of our society i often say to my wife that women not negroes are the most brainwashed people in the western world of course in this regard i am very much like thomas jefferson i want women to have absolute freedom everywhere right nowbut i hope that the revolution starts with somebody elses wife but wherever the revolution starts i am prepared to welcome it for i believe that the future of freedom in america is dependent upon the formulation of a broader definition of freedom and of man and of woman than our society is based upon and it seems to me that it is necessary to set liberty in the context of equality with the understanding that every individual is entitled to the space and the chance to fulfill himself which is only another way of saying that every individual is entitled to the instruments that will permit him to go to the boundaries of himself this i believe is a precondition for black and white freedom in america for if we want black men and white men to cooperate we must create conditions that will make it possible for them to cooperate in other words we must change the conditions that lead white men to see black men as threats to their homes to their jobs to their masculinity and to do this we must modify the situation of the white man from top to bottom for to demand that white men give up their irrational responses to black reality is to demand that a situation which requires irrational responses be abolished we must conceive and organize in this country programs that will make it impossible for one man to profit by another mans fall we must conceive and organize in this community and in every other community programs that will relieve the economic pressures on all men so that some men will not find it to their shortterm economic interest to keep other men down in other words we must take the profit out of bigotry the first steps in this direction would be a guaranteed annual income the extension of medicare to all citizens the elimination of regressive taxes and housing and educational subsidies to lower and middleincome groups ultimately however such an effort would require a reevaluation of our dominant myths including the myth of possessive individuality which is the greatest single obstacle to individuality and the myth of property which is the greatest single obstacle to the free enjoyment of property by all men let there be no misunderstanding here i am not saying that property in itself is evilwhat im saying is that property masquerading as god is the major roadblock to freedom in the world today men need a certain amount of property to validate themselves and their freedom but freedom becomes unfreedom and life loses its meaning when property becomes an inhuman idol when anything and everything is sacrificed to an abstract thing there was an interesting article on this subject in the new york post which i would like to quote at some length the article referred to the summer marches by dr martin_luther_king jr and his supporters through the gage park area of chicago peter hamill visited the neighborhood and wrote the following words this was the way the hollywood hustlers used to put their cardboard america together in a time more innocent than ours children played in the streets or burbled from baby carriages young boys mowed lawns which still smelled sweetly from the morning rains housewives pushed strollers to the grocery stores or drove the family cars to the supermarkets a man on vacation nailed a brass numeral to his front door a lot of people seemed to be polishing automobiles with an almost reverent devotion gage park on monday afternoon seemed as innocuous as anyplace where doris day had ever lived on film but underneath past the front doors of those twostory houses in the secret places behind those lawns and those automobiles and those smiling children gage park was like a tray of summer worms by the time the thing that is crawling through gage park has hooked its last inhabitant that neighborhood is almost certainly going to murder someone it is going to murder someone because of the accident of color it is going to murder someone over the combination of wood metal and concrete which the inhabitants fondly describe as their property the same animal is crawling through the gage parks of boston and new york and california and if we dont confront it soon an unspeakably horrible disaster is going to happen here its going to happen because our churches and schools have not taught people that no thing is higher than man its going to happen because our civilization has not yet learned that men are important whether they own property or not to a great extent racism in america is grounded on the whole sick syndrome surrounding real estate status greed and human pettiness if we are serious about freedom we are going to have to come to grips with that syndrome we hear a great deal about freedom and property but we must have the courage to say that words cannot be prostituted with impunity freedom is a fine word but it has its boundaries men who say the community is free when it is enslaved men who say the sky is black when it is blue are debasing reality and preparing the way for tyranny we can respect freedom only when it is intended for freedom a freedom that denies freedom must be denied in the name of freedom for to be free is not to have the power to do anything you want to do i am oppressed if i am denied the right of free movement but i am not oppressed if i am denied the right to deny my neighbor freedom of movement beyond all that we must note that the idea of oneclass onekind neighborhoods is in and of itself a clear and present danger to american democracy the standardized neighborhoods the standardized houses the standardized minds and the standardized fears which stretch from one end of america to another is a denial of the movement of life which advances by integrating differences as chardin has said joy lies not in exclusiveness and isolation but in variety which is the reservoir of experience and emotion on the other hand uniformity sameness standardization make for cultural stagnation and as sure as night follows day regimentation and eventually neofascism in order to deal with the antidemocratic ideas which have made deep inroads in american life we must make revolutionary changes at every level of our lives we confront in a word the need for not a law here or a law there but for a vital change in the whole spirit of our civilization ah signs indicate that we are moving toward a critical point in american history the rise of the radical right the deepening despair in the ghetto the deepening fear in the white community the explicit avowals of apartheid in the recent elections all these bespeak the seriousness of the moment this is an important moment in the history of the commonwealth there stretch out before us now two roads and two roads only america must now become america or something else a fourth reich perhaps or a fourth reich of the spirit to put the matter bluntlywe must become what we say we are or give in to the secret dream that blights our hearts let us rejoice that it has come to this now that freedom is dangerous perhaps men will stop prostituting it now that freedom is exploding in broad open daylight in the streets of america and vietnam perhaps we will be able to recognize her true friends as individuals we are called upon to make a creative response to this challenge by assuming our own freedom and validating it in social acts designed to create spaces in which the seeds of freedom can grow in a very real sense the struggle in america is a struggle to free white americans or to be quite precise it is a struggle to put them in the presence of their freedom and it seems to me that it is the duty of this convocation to send abroad the good news that one can be free even in boston or chicago or new york freedom isnt something you can buy on the installment plan it is not a gift from anybodyit is a priceless possession that must be reclaimed and rewon every day as silone has said one can be free even under a dictatorship all you have to do is to struggle against it he who thinks with his own head and acts with his own heart is free he who is not afraid of his neighbors is free he who struggles for what he believes in is a free man on the other hand if you live in the richest boston suburb and if you are lazy timid conformist you are not free but a slave because men deny the tiny bit of psychological freedom at their disposal it is necessary to awaken them by social movements in which wills confront each other this is the meaning of the black revolution which is inviting us to become ourselves by going to the limits of ourselves this revolution defines the state of freedom in america today and it tells us that freedom has no future in america if the black man does not have a future in freedom more than years ago walt whitman told ralph waldo emerson master i am a man who has perfect faith but master we have not come through centuries caste heroism fables to halt in this land today the spirit of walt whitman is marching today in the harlems of our mind men and women made in whitmans image are saying to us fellow americans we have perfect faith but fellow americans we have not come through slavery segregation degradation blood cotton roaches rats to halt in this land today black americans by daring to claim their freedom are daring us to claim our own and the movement which expresses that thrust will continue despite the recent revelations of the depth and extent of racism in america whatever the problems whatever the setbacks whatever the dangers oppression must be rejected at any cost for as du bois said the price of freedom is always less than the cost of oppression in the black revolution america comes hard up against a new fact the color of the world has changed and with that change a terrifying freedom has become the burden of all men especially those men who were tyrannized for so long by the arbitrary limitations of their skin if white men come forward now to claim their own freedom and individuality if they abandon their trenches and come out into the open america will become the america that was dreamedthis is the real meaning of the black revolution which is a desperate attempt to place before our freedom the burning alternatives history is offering us walt whitman said we have not come through centuries caste fables to halt in this land today black americans are saying we have not come through slavery segregation degradation to halt in this land today and the question now is what do you say while returning from a v otorr v trip to washington revv centty i took my family to visit shasta dam j was doubtful that the s visit would provide anything of interest but the view from the top of the dam was impressive looking down the appearance of the men and machines testified to the unlimited ability of american technology in the distance the men appeared to be midgets and pipes were like strands of rope then we toured the dam and eventually reached the bottom looking up i was amazed at how little the view from the top told me about the dam what seemed small from the top appeared to be overwhelming from the bottom the pipes were not like strands of rope they were large enough for a greyhound bus to pass through from the top the bottom looked far away but rather easily reached one could always fall from the bottom the top looked even further away and impossible to reach i know now that i can never visit another dam and fully appreciate it unless i see it from the top and the bottom for anything less only provides a distorted impression of the structure education at cal the university of california at berkeley has brought me into contact with many wonderful people i would have never met had my life stopped with the menial job i thought was going to be my future many of these people feellooking down from the topthat the problems facing the negro are minute when compared with all of american progress having lived the experience of the negro i know that the problems are fantastically huge huge beyond ones ability to translate into mere words i find myself filled with an intense desire to tell people what is really happening but these efforts usually end in failure because the people have neither looked up from the bottom nor have they ever been on the bottom to see what the overall situation actually looks like the racism of america becomes apparent in this process of growing awareness americas hypocrisy becomes even more real we are taught the values the beliefs the words which are supposed to characterize america long before we have reached the age of mature criticism and when we come to an understanding of america it is not in terms of these beliefs but in terms of the practices and their implications are apparent even in the liberal confines of the university of california two of the areas where i had painful experiences with the hypocrisy and racism of america were in contact with students and administrators as a teaching assistant i spent many hours in my office talking with students they would tell me much and sometimes too much for their remarks would leave me in a rage against all that they represent a sorority member asked for a special appointment so we could discuss the term paper which she was writing in the course of our conversation she began talking about her attitude toward the girls going through rush and her basis for voting against some of them she was in the sorority for one reason it was a way to gain prestige anyone who could not add to the prestige of her sorority was going to be refused membership a negro has no prestige in america so any negro girl who came to her house during rush season would be refused it was as simple as that during the conversation she referred to the international house the residence of many foreign students as the zoo other students tell me about the schemes they use to avoid the draft graduate school letters from relatives who are also doctors faking hearing defects and the like i think of the high proportion of negroes in vietnam the high proportion of negro dead and wounded in vietnam and i realize that these people still need the negro to do their dirty work so that they can continue to lead their lives of jaded comfort cal has had good administrators but far too few of them in the spring of when i was president of the campus naacp we asked permission to invite malcolm_x to speak our application went in to the dean permission was granted and pauley ballroom was reserved for the occasion in the meantime we protested to the chancellor about an employer coming to interview in the campus placement center because we had evidence that this employer had systematically discriminated against negroes for certain positions we got no reply from the chancellor so on the morning of the employers visit a small group picketed the placement center that afternoon i received a call saying that permission for malcolm_x to speak had been rescinded because he was a religious speaker and campus facilities could not be used by such persons the next day the daily california announced bishop pike was to speak in wheeler auditorium in an attempt to salvage our program i went to the chancellors office and spoke to one of his top aides this man told me that he had issued the order to cancel malcolms appearance and he alone was responsible for the decision when i protested about bishop pike i was told that pike was a theologian but malcolm was a religious speaker it occurred to me that the man to whom i was speaking was not responsible for student affairs yet he had made the decision about student affairs i then told him i considered this to be an arbitrary decision made against us because we were negroes he turned red protesting that some of his best friends were negroes he actually said it and went on to tell me about the negro who always came to his home and played with his son i believe now and i have always believed that the cancellation of malcolm_x as a speaker was a step taken to punish us for picketing the placement center when the asuc invited malcolm_x to the campus in the fall of malcolm refused of course i was further convinced of the wholly punitive nature of the earlier action that is unless i was ready to accept the idea that in this period of time malcolm became a theologian and not a religious speaker this was my first real encounter with that monolith called the power structure and i was badly stung you look at them with their cold blue eyes and their hard faces and you realize that they have the power and you have the skin since that time i have come to a fuller understanding of how much the power structure is a replica of the racism in americanot so much in its pronouncements as in its practices throughout the university you find evidence of it negroes speak openly of it but the whites are blind to it because they have never stood at the bottom of the hill and do not know how much they reflect this racism you remember the key examples the negro secretary who was fired because she struck a white worker who called her a nigger the food services worker who was fired because he ostensibly refused to bring a note from his doctor explaining his absence from work the papers explaining his dismissal make no mention of the fact that he belonged to a religious group which did not believe in going to doctors the negro administrator who was dismissed as incompatible because he openly objected to his supervisors racial slurs another supervisor had complained that he was not submissive enough the golden bear restaurant which has never sullied its appearance with a negro waitress and of course they claim that no negroes apply negro girls admit they do not want to go through the pain of applying when they know they will not be hired we know that the personnel staff there have a practice of hiring from a waiting list of names suggested by other waitresses so it is a closed system of whites only most enraging of all the practices of the power structure are the attempts to get more negro athletes into cal for years i have talked with alumni and administrators who were interested in getting more negro athletes into cal but who expressed no interest in the negroes who were only interested in cals academic offerings these men feel that if they could draw more heavily on the negro athletes in the state then cal might once again rise to prominence in sports but the view from the bottom of the hill indicates that negroes need more educated people much more than we need athletes when these people come and express interest in the negro you soon become aware that they are not at all interested in negroes they are interested in cal sports and if they can use negroes to get to the top they will do so without offering the athletes very much anyone heard of john erby lately my reaction to these men has always been similar to my reaction to the draftdodger one young negro expressed it this way to me one afternoon in the bears lair all these cats are saying to us is to go out and find them some strong niggers that was how he felt about it then that is how i have always felt about it similar experiences take place in the classrooms you study and learn about america and in the process you learn how to analyze the situation and come to a fuller understanding of all the dimensions of americas treatment of the negro you learn how negro children are taught to dream the american dream at such early age and so effectively that by the time they come to the awareness that this dream does not include them they are unable to carry that awareness to its logical conclusion and destroy both the dream and its teacher we are even taught that this conclusion is irrational but the situation of the black man in this country is so irrational that only irrational acts will save us you learnin your objective search for truththat white america accrues gains from racism and discrimination although people use you as an example of what the negro can do you acquire objective evidence that the overwhelming majority of negroes see little change in their life conditions for example the sociologist from the university of texas who analyzed the rates at which negroes were overtaking whites in their struggle for equal treatment and then extrapolated these rates to see how long from it would take the negro to reach full equality the answer at the rates of change it would take years in education years in occupation years in income of persons and years in family income and you get angry other professors even in their attempts to be kind and helpful reflect the hypocrisy and insidious racism of this country the professors who gave their time and ability to the analysis of public school history textbooks and found that they were remiss in their treatment of the negro and other mi norities yet they do not find it possible to inaugurate a course in the history of american minorities which would help to correct a very bad situation the professor who writes an introduction to a paperback version of a classic study of the negro family but includes twice a subtle but vicious insult to negroes and you ask yourself how deep does this go can it ever end and you get angrier my experience as a negro at cal has been one of moving through an intellectual microcosm of america the experience has been pregnant with promise but the promise is dimmed by the actualities you see all around you the agonizing thing about it is that they want you to adjust to this system and become a part of it you know that both the draftdodger and the football rooter are building their comfort and ease on the shoulders of the black man shoulders which have boosted this country since but after a goal is reached they always stick a knife into the heart of the burdenbearer the negro soldier who died in vietnam but who could not be buried in the cemetery in his hometown they want you to adjust to this and help them to avoid the draft help them to find negro athletes and you know if you do this you will only perpetuate their exploitation of the people of your birth and heritage so you protest you tell them that it isnt fair and they must be much more equitable in their dealings with youeither serve with the black man or get the black man out of vietnam just as they keep themselves out of vietnam either forget about black athletes or seek black scholars as diligently as they seek black athletes and they look at you with a dumb look you arent the negro they know you dont smile at them you dont scratch your head and shuffle your feet you dont come to their dinners at the faculty club smoke their big cigars and help them develop ways to continue their exploitation of the negro not knowing how to deal with an unsubmissive negro they cancel your speakers have you dismissed from your job they make it plain that either you play their game and do so the way they want it played or you will suffer this is the agony the wretchedness of the black man who stands at the top of the hill and looks down remembering how it was to look up and knowing what it is like down there if you adjust to their evil system you will enjoy some of its fruits but they are bitter fruits for they are based on the practice of keeping other blacks at the bottom of the hill if you fight their evil system they will use their power to silence you either path is an agonizing one but if you re member the shining example of brother malcolm he was not afraid to die because he loved us so the choice is easy knowing that you will always be considered an ingrate the agony turns to rage i cheered the fsm free student movement but did not join because i have sworn to myself that if any policeman ever lays his hands on me then either he or i must die right there i have found that there were times when i longed not for more blacks on the uc football team but that the team would lose more games i remember sitting before the tv set last year and cheering each time a building in watts erupted into flames all this in an attempt to avoid the insanity that comes from adjusting to and thereby accepting americas exploitation of the black man and the uc version of that exploitation all this to avoid the insanity that comes from thinking that one has really made it as a negro when all around you are friends relatives and others the folk who will not be permitted to make it because they are negro the view from the top is so distorting and the view from the bottom so overwhelming that i wonder if america will ever conceive and undertake the steps necessary to bring full justice to the negro the more i study the more i realize how unlikely this will be so i long for even more drastic steps perhaps someday we blacks will become fully cognizant of the situation perhaps the brothers in vietnam will one day realize that they have been shooting at the wrong enemy and turn those weapons toward their true enemies perhaps the brothers in all the ghettos will one day realize that we should not just have cheered watts we should have joined them at the same time in our own cities there wouldnt be enough national guard to handle that one then the power structure will move again and we will be utterly crushed but it is more palatable than this living death brotherslet us remember malcolmit is better to die on your feet than live on your knees for nearly years a philip randolph has been a leader in the fight for full citizenship rights for black americans he is today the elder statesman of afroamerican labor leaders his credentials now read father of the historic march on washington president negro american labor council lone negro member of the executive council of aflcio international president of the brotherhood of sleeping car porters he proposed the first civil_rights march on washington in which resulted in president roosevelts famous executive order creating the presidents fair employment practice committee these accomplishments are not unrelated to his earlier years when he was a young radical with only a small number of followersand was being called by some newspapers and police authorities the most dangerous negro in the united states he was born in in a rural town near jacksonville florida at a time when the deep south was perfecting the combination of negro disfranchisement and violence which would keep white supremacy unbroken for the next years his father was a respected minister of the militant african methodist episcopal church this was young randolphs first teacher and his first exposure to radical thought the elder randolph preached to his son the subversive doctrine that race was a distinction without significancethat god himself was neither black nor whitethat a mans quality not his color was what mattered his family convinced him that education was the key to whatsoever future success he hoped for young philip and his brother attended cookman institute in jacksonville florida with tuition money they had earned themselves after finishing high school he left the south and continued his education inspired by his father with a feeling for the spoken word randolph showed an early interest in acting particularly shakespearean drama following his marriage to lucille e green former virginia school teacher in he helped organize the shakespearean society in harlem playing the roles of hamlet othello and romeo but randolphs widely admired eloquence soon took him from the dramatic stage to the leaders platform his first experience with the cause of negro labor came shortly after he left ccny and took a job with the fall river line in attempting to organize the steamship companys waiters randolph was summarily fired meanwhile he had read extensively in philosophy economics and political science developing an interest in the socialist party of eugene victor debs which he eventually joined then in under the influence of the sociologist lester ward he and chandler owen founded the messenger avowing itself the only radical magazine in america this socialist publication has been regarded by scholars as among the most brilliantly edited ventures in negro journalism in addition to militantly championing negro rights the messenger spoke out on other issues thus in while speaking in cleveland against american participation in world war i randolph was arrested and later described by the lust committee forerunner of the dies committee as the most dangerous negro in americaa charge often repeated down the years by opponents of negro rights in at the request of milton webster t t paterson and ashley totten randolph undertook leadership of the campaign to organize the brotherhood of sleeping car porters this uphill battle marked by fierce resistance from the railway companies and the vicissitudes of the depression was finally won in when the bscp won certification meanwhile in the messenger became the black worker the official publication of the sleeping car porters the brotherhood of sleeping car porters came into existence at a time when american trade unions including those in the railroad industry were losing members among other reasons for this decrease in membership was an aggressive labor policy of a large number of businesses the pullman company was experiencing a decrease in net income which alone was enough to make it more aggressive in its antiunion policies although this was an unfavorable period in which to start a labor union especially in an antiunion stronghold the porters forged ahead with their organizing activities one advantage which the brotherhood had from its beginning was that its leader was not employed by the pullman company nor had randolph ever been a porter the pullman company referred to him as an outside agitator and questioned his fitness to lead the porters in their effort to improve their lot to this question randolph referred his opponents to a decision of the united states railroad labor board which sanctioned the right of employees to choose as their representatives persons not employed by the company randolph was at this time already a keen student of labor economics and philosophy he had studied at the college of the city of new york and had lectured at the rand school of social science in new york city he had become interested in labor unions as an instrument of socialism the railroads were one of the three largest employers of negro labor in the nation almost twothirds of the railroads negro workers were laborers and the highest job to which a negro could reasonably hope to aspire was that of pullman car porter but to negroes it was a job to aspire to porters travelled saw the country served the best white society for the travelling public the sleeping car porter was part of the romance of the railroad the public didnt know of course that the major railroad brotherhoods rigidly excluded negroes from better jobs or that porters were forced to provide their own uniforms and buy the very polish with which they shined the shoes of the slumbering patron they didnt know that the porter worked a hour week and earned about nineteen cents an hour before tips randolph launched into the difficult tasks of organizing members and building public support he argued the porters case in the black worker now the official organ of the union and toured the country speaking to hundreds of audiences the pullman company which had only accepted white labor unions after a bitter struggle and a bloody strike refused to recognize a black one instead union porters began to lose their jobs filipinos and mexicans were hired to replace them the company called randolph a wildeyed uppity negro hustler who never made up a pullman berth in his life and circulated stories that he was an exploiter of his own race and a communist but randolph was a persuasive organizer by the brotherhood could claim well over half the porters and pullman maids its members constituted the largest single block of organized negro workers in industry it was a remarkable achievement in april the porters rallied around their new leader in a nearunanimous show of strength and confidence they voted to strike in order to win recognition of their union randolph didnt want a strike he was gambling and he lost the governments mediation board refused to step in other unions lent no support and the company prepared to break the strike facing the certain prospect of mass firings and the destruction of the union randolph called off the strike it took the depression and the social revolution of the new deal to unionize america pullman was forced by law to recognize any unions chosen by its employees and owing to randolphs tireless work the porters once more overwhelmingly chose the brotherhood in years to the day after he had begun the pullman car company signed its first agreement with a philip randolph of the sleeping car porters never before had a white employer signed an agreement with a negro labor leader when the national negro congress was organized in the midnineteen thirties a philip randolph became its president this militant organization was a forerunner of presentday civil_rights groups such as the congress of racial equality core and the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc the following is a quote taken from the national secretarys report on the aims of the organization in the official proceedings of the national negro congress chicago meeting february mittee which deliberated on resolutions submitted to the congress for the purpose of allowing for the maximum interchange of opinion between delegates subsessions of the congress were held dividing delegates in the morning into sections on the basis of the particular phase of the negro problem in which each was interested in addition the youth subsessions was further divided into smaller discussion groups in this way easily one half of the delegates were able to give voice to their opinions to make suggestions and to actively influence the proceedings at general sessions held in the evening invited speakers and leading delegates were heard upon important topics and the legislative measures of the congress were adopted the national negro congress was called to meet the increasingly difficult economic and social problems which face the negro people in america the need for the establishment through united action of a strong movement against the social and economic repressions being experienced by the negro made such a congress imperative while major stress at the congress was laid upon joint action by negroes themselves there remained very clearly in the minds of the delegates the need for cooperation with friendly organizations of members of other races to solve the common economic problems facing all likewise it was realized that the negro congress must exist as a federation of organizations for the purpose of pooling the strength of constituent groups in the attack upon the evils retarding the securing by the negro of his manhood rights the congress was not formed and does not exist to duplicate the work of any existing organization rather it exists to add strength and to give support to every progressive and meaningful program in aid of the negro people in their just demand for equal opportunity and complete social and economic rights the congress had no desire to exclude any group that sincerely worked for the expressed aims of the congress and any group that so worked could not be charged with unduly influencing or dominating its activity and of the constituent groups participating it can be accurately stated that none attempted such domination in his keynote address to the delegates assembled in chicago on this occasion randolph said i greet you in the spirit of the deathless courage of the th and th century black rebels and martyrs of human justice in the spirit of frederick douglass and nat turner of gabriel and denmark vesey of harriet tubman and sojourner truth those noble rebels who struck out in the dark days of slavery that negro men and women might be free we have met in times of worldwide storm and stress of social confusion economic chaos political disorder and intellectual uncertainty social institutions from the church to the family are undergoing change and instability unemployment falls like a deadening pall upon every great power and machine nation already fascist italy is on the march to subjugate the ancient kingdom of ethiopia while france and germany are in a state of truce still at bay now what of the american scene it is no less forbidding and full of contradictions unsettlement and cross currents in our social economic and political life our contemporary history is a witness to the stark fact that black america is a victim of both class and race prejudice and oppression this congress is called to attempt to meet the problems of black america the submerged tenth of the population with the advent of the second world war randolph became increasingly concerned about the exelusion of negroes from jobs in the war industries while on a southern trip with milton webster an official of the pullman porters union he conceived the idea of a massive negro march on washington he wrote the dramatic plan in the afroamerican press and agitated for it on the street corners of harlem and throughout the united states his efforts bore fruit as local march on washington committees sprung up across the country hearing of the proposed march new yorks mayor laguardia and mrs franklin d roosevelt called randolph to city hall and sought to persuade him from executing it following this meeting which failed in its purpose randolph was summoned to the white house where he met with president franklin d roosevelt and his advisors when randolph firmly reiterated his refusal to cancel the march unless negroes were guaranteed equal employment opportunities roosevelt on june issued executive order establishing the presidents committee on fair employment practices the order issued the march was called off and the national council for a permanent fepc was set up with randolph and dr alan knight chalmers as cochairmen it was not long before randolph was involved in another aspect of the struggle against job discrimination railway unions and companies had long been in collusion against the hiring of negro locomotive firemen whose difficulties became more acute with the development of diesel engines at their request randolph formed the provisional committee of firemen which initiated legal action resulting in a supreme court decision outlawing antinegro union deals with railroads in randolph won still another executive order this time from president truman testifying before the senate armed services committee randolph had indicated he would call upon negroes not to register for military duty from a harlem platform he was called to the white house by the president who shortly thereafter issued executive order establishing a committee on equality of treatment and opportunity in the armed forces meanwhile randolph had become a leading figure in the american federation of labor and when the afl merged with the cio was elected a vicepresident of the combined body and a member of its man executive councilthe only negro to hold this position within the labor movement and its conventions over the years randolph pressed the fight against all forms of discrimination and segregation largely owing to his efforts whiteonly clauses have been eliminated from the constitutions of all international unions randolph recognized however that the elimination of constitutional barriers would be only the first step toward the full integration of the negro into the house of labor and that continued pressure from negro workers would be required for further progress to organize this pressure he founded the negro american labor council and was elected its first president at its first meeting in cleveland november while the labor movement has been the focus of randolphs crusade for racial democracy his preeminence in the overall civil_rights struggle had brought him the unofficial title of dean of negro leaders and made him much sought after not only by civil_rights activists but by african leaders as well in with dr martin_luther_king jr just emerged into national leadership from the montgomery bus boycott randolph led americans in the prayer pilgrimage to washington in and he chaired two youth marches for integrated schools involving and young people respectively in the book the day they marched lerone bennett senior editor of ebony magazine gives us the following description of the historic march on washington it was the beginning of something and the ending of something it came years and days after the signing of the emancipation proclamation it came like a force of nature like a whirlwind like a flood it overwhelmed by its massiveness and finality a quarter of a million people were in it and of it and millions more watched on tv and huddled around radios there had never been anything quite like it a tv spectacular a sunday school picnic a political convention an impressive demonstration of negro unity ka visible expression of interracial brotherhood and almost unprecedented exhibition of resolve a new concept of lobbying a show of strength an outburst a call to the national conscience the mammoth march on washington was everything they said it was and more and it moved men and women as they had never been moved before the planning and execution of this massive march was the highwater mark in the long and eventful career of a philip randolph by this time the itinerant preachers son had been invited to the white house by four u s presidents back in he had accompanied the militant negro leader w monroe trotter to an interview with calvin coolidge to protest lynching and on june he was spokesman for a delegation of civil_rights leaderers who met with president eisenhower two more presidential visitswith kennedy and johnsonwere to follow but under radically different circumstances for late in in the midst of an upsurging civil_rights revolution a philip randolph called negro leaders together to map out plans for a new march on washington this time there would be no cancellation despite political pressures randolph had become convinced that a dramatic display of mass action was essential if the nation was to make progress towards full civil_rights trade unions liberals and religious groups lent unprecedented support to the plan and on august more than a quarter million americans black and white descended on the capitol in a demand for jobs and freedom as father and director of the march the largest demonstration in the history of the country randolph had forged an extraordinary unit between the negro community and its white allies and in the process renewed his unsought position as dean of negro leaders negro students and their parents are often in a dilemma when it comes to deciding for or against a negro allege or an integrated one there colleges and universities in this country that were established for and are operated primarily for negroes located primarily in the south or in border states are private and are taxsupported of the undergraduate negro students enrolled in college today slightly over twothirds are in these institutions in general negroes attend these colleges so that they can acquire lifelong friends and participate without restrictions in extracurricular activities such as fraternities and sororities also the cost of attending a negro college is considerably less than that of attending a predominately white one even so it must be realized that equal education in most instances proves to be the key to true equality to other areas of life on the american scene the predominately negro college is considered a segregated institution if it is agreed that students should be permitted to grow and learn in an integrated environment then it seems necessary to break the negro college tradition among negroes although these colleges may have integrated faculties and token numbers of white students they are still considered segregated institutions and therefore less desirable for preparing students to live in an integrated society than are interracial colleges in all fairness and objectivity the only adequate generalization one can make about negro colleges is that they are uniformly worse off then their white counterparts first their students are almost exclusively negro a fact that does not necessarily make for a weak college were all other things equal most negro students come from poor allnegro high schools which have long suffered the pangs of discrimination in the south as well as in the north thus the colleges have been forced to take the students where they are and while southern education for negroes and whites is inferior as compared to that in the north it is worse for negroes than for whites the cumulative effects of an inferior elementary and secondary education have been reflected in the type of students who enter and graduate from the negro college the student is generally bankrupt in verbal skills on national examinations he has generally scored extremely low when compared with his white counterparts this problem stems from the vicious cycle of poorly prepared negro college graduates teaching academically weak high school students who go on to inferior negro colleges the teachers the faculty in negro colleges is predominately negro a fact which in itself has nothing to do with the quality of teaching which eventuates were it not for certain builtin conditions which do contribute to poor teaching first more than twothirds of all negro college teachers graduated from segregated high schools and colleges in the south where academic standards have been shown to be considerably lower than those maintained in white schools in the same area further many would not be in teaching were it not for restrictions of segregation having not planned to enter teaching they now feel trapped and their trapped feelings create in them an indifference to their work twothirds of them indicate that they maintain low or at least flexible academic standards in their classes they enjoy a unique kind of security of not having to compete with scholars in the wider community this often means that they may occupy positions for which they are not qualified the scarcity of qualified teachers results in edds doctors of education teaching courses in history science mathematics and english there is in general an antiintellectual atmosphere on most negro college campuses however since college teaching is probably the most prestigeful occupation among negroes there is a great deal of jockeying for position in the segregated academic community serious matters often take the backseat while they engage in society activities calculated to give them added prestige in the college setting it also means that they do not have time to read attend the theatre or give thought to serious scholarly work their society orientation results in a kind of ideaphobia they allow their lives to be subsumed by trivia this is probably one of the reasons why negro college teachers rarely have time to do scholarly research and writing there are several other reasons why negro college teachers are only about half as productive academically as are their white counterparts first they are isolated from the mainstream of academic life in this country second they are generally unprepared to do worthwhile independent research and creative writing third heavy academic duties allow them little time to write their median teaching load being hours weekly fourth there are seldom funds available for research fifth few negro colleges expect their teachers to engage in research and creative writing this appears to be a result of the ideaphobia prevalent on many campuses the teacher who writes anything worthwhile may be criticized deprecated and finally ostracized as a social misfit in many cases he is asked to resign because of his radical ideas this happens not only in state universities controlled by segregationists but in private schools as well dr w e b du bois one of this centurys greatest scholars was forced to leave a private negro university shortly before he moved to ghana because of his radicalism although negroes with doctorates are few in number they are fast leaving the negro campuses for jobs in industry government and white colleges this is probably why today only per cent of the teachers at negro colleges have doctorates as compared to per cent at white institutions while the negro college teacher in general is an unhappy person usually because he although more highly educated than the general community has to suffer the indignities inherent in living in southern cities and hamlets it is the negro phd who is most unhappy educated in liberal environments of the east and the north he literally suffocates in the confines of the south the fact that most negro college presidents are autocrats is also significantly contributory to teacher unhappiness it is understandable that the greatest turnover in negro colleges is among teachers with doctorates quite the reverse of the situation in interracial institutions it is because of the phd exodus that negro colleges must rely more heavily on teaching faculty at the instructor level per cent than do white institutions per cent in general the negro college is a small institution with an average enrollment of approximately students fifty per cent of them have enrollments of less than the size poverty and lack of strong teachers cause them to restrict their curricular offerings thirty per cent of the faculty in white institutions as contrasted with per cent in negro institu tions are teaching engineering mathematics and biological and physical sciences conversely per cent of the faculty in negro colleges and only per cent in white colleges are teaching education courses english physical education and home economics further negro institutions are handicapped in the areas of physical plant housing facilities for students and faculty and library limited classroom facilities make it necessary to set up large classes limited dormitory facilities force students to live in crowded and often unwholesome conditions financial difficulties also limit the number and kinds of volumes available in their libraries in general negro college libraries leave much to be desired although the negro college has prepared the majority of todays outstanding negro leaders there is some doubt that it can meet the needs of the negro student today society has become more complex and more integrated in the last few years a negro college education is hardly adequate for the majority of negro youth this is not to say that some negro colleges are not producing in spite of the severe handicaps under which they labor topnotch students interracial colleges in the past few negro students have sought admission to interracial or allwhite colleges in many cases the cost of attending was prohibitive students felt that their backgrounds were weak and they did not wish to appear to be academically dull in the company of whites also the negro student having grown up in a segregated community and having attended an allnegro high school either in the south or in a northern ghetto felt unsure of himself and anxious around whites however there are good reasons for believing that such fears are unfounded for over years the national scholarship and service fund for negro students has assisted more than negro students enroll in interracial colleges throughout the country in kenneth b clark and lawrence plotkin under the sponsorship of nssfns made an extensive study of the success of these students of the students included in the study they found that the net dropout rate was onefourth the national average fewer than per cent of the students as compared to approximately per cent of white students do not complete college the study further indicated that negro students enrolled in predominantly white institutions of higher learning did average or better academic work thirtyone per cent achieved an average of b or better and per cent achieved c or worse for the four years enrolled slightly less than per cent graduated with honors and about one per cent were elected to phi beta kappa although the clark and plotkin study indicates that negro students in predominantly white colleges adjust socially and participate fully in the activities of college life there are still some reasons to believe that negro students segregate themselves in large college and university environments although a few students attempt to lose themselves among white students and try to deny their negroness the majority form little congoes and refuse to associate with whites outside the classroom the fact that negro students in predominantly white institutions choose to mingle with their own kind is not unusual since it is observed that indian chinese african and other likecultural groups tend to mingle more freely among themselves than they do among white american students the clark and plotkin study suggests when it reports that per cent of the negro students said that they do not read negro newspapers that attending small predominantly white liberal arts colleges tends to make negro students antinegro in their personal orientation although there may be some undesirable effects from attending a white school it is felt that the negro student will be more able to compete in an integrated society if he attends an integrated school rather than an allnegro college it has often puzzled i d me when some amer icans have approached me with the question are you a negro when it is very obvious that i do represent an unmistakable specimen of that which the anthropologist will call negroid not long ago i heard over the radio that two negroes and a canadian were captured trying to blowup the statue of liberty in new york those referred to as negroes were of course americans of african descent while the canadian was of course a canadian of french descent often referred to as frenchcanadian what actually is meant by negro in the american usage could it be a racial social economic political or cultural categorization if racially categorized the term negro as commonly used in the united states of america would seem less accurate and less scientific there are only very few people who can actually be classified as negroes in the united states the greater number of the ethnic group called negroes are stock blended of africans american indians europeans and asiatics in fact there is no pure race anywhere today in the world furthermore the phrase colored people used sometimes for negroes in america appears psychologically unwholesome as much as it is equivocal and ambiguous physical science teaches that anything visible is colored otherwise it will be invisible so that colored should be equally applicable to all varieties of mankind or races if colored means noncaucasian then it should be equally applicable to all peoples not whitesuch as the japanese indian chinese tahitian samoans etc but in america the word colored seems to be tagged to the ethnic group called negroes in this case the label does not appear to describe the goods negroism is an american creation it is an american concept not based on economic deprivation or lack of education or on cultural sterility but on white americans idea of the african type of man blackman and that mans place in the american society it is an american concept that is socially derived politically sanctioned and economically abused to the typical white american negro means a man whose entire ways of life must be fashioned in the image of the white mans before he is recognized as a human being it means a person of inferior race who should do menial jobs shine shoes or wait at tables it means a man who must lose his unique identity in a country diffused with prevailing customs of racial dichotomy many white americans both literate and illiterate have yet to overcome that irrational and unscientific notion of race that has been instilled in them through their processes of socialization that irrational notion has become a deepseated mental attitude usually externalized in different degrees of intensity in the american society it is that irrational notion that seduces many socalled white liberals into feeling that they are best qualified to solve the economic social political and psychological problems of the socalled negroesno white liberal can categorically negate the psychological connotations of negroism by posing as the friend of the negroes liberalism is not an adequate cloak for paternalism and ethnocentricism those white liberals who often pose as negro friends are the same individuals who will not invite colored students to their houses for fear of what their neighbors will say they are the same academicians who will threaten their white secretaries with employment termination because they held hands with black students on the university campus they are the same academicians who will take a jab at the academic capabilities of negro students but have failed to motivate them or demonstrate teaching excellence they are the same individuals who are always concerned about opportunities for the negroes but always make sure that other white liberals are employed first they are the same individuals who insist that negro writers must write about human beings not about negroes even though those writers have accumulated their experiences as negroes could these wellmeaning academicians be inferring that negroes are not human beings it definitely seems that there is in the present american society a growing conflict between social objectives of the people and their religious consciences this conflict has definitely tinged and affected social consciousness and democratic processes it is not necessary for the negro to be what the white americans think he should be before he can fully participate in the american society or gain recognition of his human dignity it is not at all not necessary that the negro strive to pattern his entire life and personality after the white man before he can be counted no man in the face of the world is more pathetic than that man who finds himself wedged between two cultures to neither of which he fully belongs the negro has identity which must be recognized and reckoned with the negro has a history which is unique and worth teaching in all american schools it is not necessary for the negro to lose his identity before his human dignity can be recognized and respected actually until the whites and the blacks in america mutually know and respect each other there is going to be a long and bitter struggle for universal peace and progress there must be unequivocal concessions of democratic rights social justice cultural courtesy and human dignity in america without the insidious categorizations of negroism the present negroes are no longer a people cringing and fawning but rather a people becoming more aware of their own power and potentialities a people beginning to take a pride in their marvelous achievements and ever determined to obtain a just and due treatment in a nation supposedly founded on the great ideals of freedom justice equality and respect for human personality of recent in america the black man has come to articulate the ideology of black_power many bigots racists and prejudiced individuals have distorted the ideology and equated it to racism violence and lawlessness some black americans have even joined the ranks of the biased critics and racists this is the unkindest cut of all black_power is not an ideology of hate nor of violence nor of fatalistic destruction it is rather an ideology of love and peace articulating political strength economic viability social dignity and cultural identity for the oppressed black man white power by its very nature is not analogous to black_power white power structure is viciousracially obsessed and characterized by narrowminded exclusiveness black_power on the other hand is the expression of those who know and understand the agony pain and humiliation of negroism in america it is an expression born out of the frustrations and agony of those who have been denied human rights and objective manhood in a society supposedly founded on the ideal of freedom justice and equality white power structure that has condoned social evils and the emasculation of the black man has yet to be objectively repudiated as evil and violent but yet the same supporters of that white power structure and establishment decry black_power which by its very nature speaks of love and dignity for the emasculated black man black_power does not speak of violence but of the right of selfdefense even as guaranteed in the constitution of the united states of america syllogistic reasoning should not be used to obviate the evil realities of white power structure and establishment because some who chant black_power articulate their ghetto frustrations by riot does not make black_power violent likewise because christianity was used to justify economic exploitation political strangulation and social deprivation in south africa rhodesia and other europeancolonized areas of the world does not necessarily make christianity evil and violent that the pope blessed italian soldiers before their atrocious rape of ethiopia in the third decade of the twentieth century does not make catholicism racist and violent the function of an ideology is not necessarily the acid test of its truth or falsity therefore those who denigrate the ideology of black_power should read history or look far into the sociopolitical realities of the times the ideology of black_power must become the ideology of all people who share the brotherhood of blackness this brotherhood of blackness is not a brotherhood based solely on the issue of being black it is rather a brotherhood based on the hard fact that a majority of those who have been consistently denied the right of selfdetermination human dignity and respect for human personality are the blacks and the nonwhite black_power is the symbolic call to all black people to unite and organize for the assumption of the only power that will regenerate them from the onslaught of persistent sociopolitical degradation and relentless economic deprivation and exploitation black_power is the clarion call for functional collectivization of the black masses for an ultimate assumption and sharing of economic and political power through constructive and objective programs as an ideology black_power addresses itself to an old and perennially vital question to what extent can a man determine his own destiny parenthetically it is asking the question to what extent can and should the socalled negro determine his destiny in a society with a prevailing custom of racial dichotomy in such a society identity has become a crucial issue the socalled negro because of the high degree of his physical visibility continues to face unique problems despite civil_rights laws black_power articulates the issue of identity and likens the socalled negro to a guitar string an ordinary guitar string that is unattached to a guitar may appear to be free twist one end of it and it may respond as a free string but it is not free to produce music as a guitar string is supposed to do but when it is fixed to a guitar and tightened until taut then and only then is it free to be a guitar string that will produce music black_power visualizes the socalled negro without identity without culturewithout economic and political power in america as like the guitar string unmounted a thing mute inert and without power it is saying in essence that the socalled negro with economic and political power in america will be like the guitar string mountedpossessing voice and almost a soul the guitar string however great its potentialities can never wail or produce music at will it can have no autonomy or recognition its destiny will lie in the hands of its master likewise the socalled negro may have marvellous potentialities he may have made progress in america he may have civil_rights bills passed for him but he is nowhere unless he has economic political and social power as well as a proud sense of identity such identity has nothing to do with merely being black or with the sociocultural virtues or qualities of african heritage it is an identity based on the common issues of racially buttressed economic and political oppression and subjugation in the united states of america with its prevailing custom of racial dichotomy ethnic pride or appreciation is not the same thing as ethnic or racial conceit an intelligent modification of ethnic identity and appreciation has functional importance for the perspective and objective maintenance of societal image or equilibrium black_power unequivocally articulates desegregation but not integration and assimilation in the united states for those who urge integration the big questions are integration into what or whose society integration at what price is the socalled negro an american if not why is he not if he is an american then why is he a negro and why is he walking the streets of america for over years begging for civil_rights which are already guaranteed all americans in the constitution of the united states even the displaced europeans who found refuge in america since the two world wars are already enjoying civil_rights even from the very first day they arrived in the united states yet the socalled negro who shed his blood sweat and tears in order that europe could have peace liberty and freedom is still to enjoy that same peace liberty and freedom the children of the same displaced europeans who found refuge in a merica are now the ones who spit and throw stones tomatoes eggs and insults at the children of the same socalled negroes who gave their lives blood sweat and tears to free europe from the grips of nazism and fascism what guarantees of real freedom are there for the socalled negroes in the united states with its white power structure black_power says emphatically that integration into the present american white society is not consistent with reality because this white power structure with its established system was built and is sustained through a systematic exploitation and subjugation of the black man inside and outside of the united states therefore to advocate the integration of the black man into such a system is nothing short of delusion and ethnic suicide the call of black_power is the call for functional collectivization of the black masses for their ultimate liberation and entrenchment in a position of economic and political power it is a call that urges the oppressed black masses to unite and engage in a painstaking systematic building of an organization necessary for the assumption and sharing of economic and political power in the united states black_power is an ideology that calls upon the black masses to lead and essentially finance their own organization in order to sustain that potentiality needed for action and direction ethnic pride and identity must not be sacrificed for meaningless integration no ethnic group in america subjugates its organization under the control and leadership of another ethnic group the jews lead and control jewish organizations the polishamericans control polishamerican organizations the japaneseamericans control the japaneseamerican organizations even the chineseamericans control the chineseamerican organizations it is therefore not racism if black_power urges the black man to lead and control his organizations such an advocacy is very consistent with americanism black_power operates within the framework of americanism and therefore should not be called racist and violent unless we are saying in essence that americanism is racist and violent for the black man in search of identity and power in america black_power is the ideology of the time it is the ideology that will expurgate the economic and political paralysis that emasculates and humiliates the black man in the white power structure and system in the united states black_power does not mean black isolationism or separatism but rather black unity and cooperation for a meaningful participation in the complex society of the united states of america black_power is not analogous to white supremacy neither does it mean racial polarization or dichotomization black_power means to the socalled negroes what zionism means to the jews the centralization of ethnic effort and the recognition of an ethnic fountain black_power rejects both white racialism and black chauvin m ism it merely articulates racial or ethnic coexistence on the basis of equality and respect for human personality language has in rej ti cent years been recog i i nized as a sociological factor in the life of a society both consciously and unconsciously language can influence the attitudes of a people as regards the components of their environment it has been generally overlookedhowever that language can have a decided effect in engendering racial prejudice cultural anthropology has much to say on the broad question of culture contact between the dominant and minority groups in a society and language has been delineated as an area of such contact however this delineation has been generally restricted primarily to the origin and development of language little emphasis has been placed upon the link between language patterns and race relations an examination therefore of the connection of language and prejudice towards the negro could illuminate those areas of race relations not heretofore stressed language as a potent force in our society goes beyond being merely a communicative device language not only expresses ideas and concepts but may actually shape them often the process is completely unconscious with the individual concerned unaware of the influence of the spoken or written expressions upon his thought processes language can thus become an instrument of both propaganda and indoctrination for a given idea the dominant majority in the united states has introduced the element of language in buttressing negro stereotyping it is generally accepted that such stereotyping is one of the prime contributory factors to the development of prejudice so powerful is the role of language in its imprint upon the human mind that even the minority group may begin to accept the very expressions that aid in its stereotyping thus even negroes may develop speech patterns filled with expressions leading to the strengthening of stereotypes an analysis of the symbolic meanings of some of our language components that can release the trigger of the stereotype reveals that these meanings are a force of underestimated potency in race relations the analysis that follows is admittedly a cursory review of the subject however it is hoped that it will lead to further discussion and exploration it could prove fruitful to select a number of expressions current upon our present scene in order to discern their connection with prejudice towards the negro we are here not concerned with the origins of these expressions but only with their sociological significance to modern american life dark horse this expression is commonly used to describe an individual who achieves a particular goal without a previous display of ability or social traits necessary for the achievement in a sense it connotes a development arising completely out of fortuitous circumstances unrelated to the merits of the individual concerned thus the dark horse in a presidential nominating convention is a person whose talents for political office have been unrecognizable prior to his sudden emersence as a candiw date and whose success has been completely unpredictable aside from the dramatic spectacle of a political convention the term has a similar meaning for events in everyday life the dark horse for example will get the job despite his lack of qualifications for it as used by the white majority the term becomes shrouded in concepts of inferiority it is not farfetched to suggest that these concepts are carried over to attitudes concerning darkskinned peoples in general the danger of the term lies in the idea that dark somehow or other signifies lack of ability in a particular endeavor a dark person therefore begins his ascent to a particular goal devoid of the characteristics necessary for its final achievement and only fulfills his objectives as a result of a completely unexplainable accident the effect of the expression upon a white person may be unconscious but as a symbol it can become ingrained into the mental processes and lead to the formation of stereotyped thinking black in general language use throughout the history of western civilization the word black has had a particular significance with the rise of the commercial exploitation of the peoples of africa and asia this significance has solidified into a format that evolved from the dominant socioeconomic forces of western society our own english language has carried over much of this significance and developed some of its own again even the minority group whose interests run counter to the symbolic use of this word in our culture may accept it as a part of its language patterns in the evolution of language certain components have evoked images created in the context of a culture thus the sociocultural setting in which the word black becomes a part of language can shape its symbolic as against its formal meaning in our present day culture black symbolizes evil uncleanliness defamation such usage is found in both everyday speech as well as poetic imagery this conception of evil is also found in our designation of magic as black or white with black magic connoting a greater degree of banefulness than white magic even a cursory examination of websters new collegiate dictionary reveals the existence of adverse implications attached to the word black perhaps it would be valuable to pointup these implications by listing the following sampling blackballto exclude from membership or ostracize blackbook a book containing names that are out of favor or in disgrace blackendefame or sully blackguarda person who uses scurrilous language or treats others with foul abuse blackletterunlucky inauspicious as in blackletter days blacklista list of persons regarded as suspect or as deserving of censure blackmailextortion by intimidation black dogthe spirit of illhumor or melancholy as to be under the black dog the above meanings are in addition to others of everyday usage thus black looks are defined as sullen hostile foreboding black cruelty as foully or outrageously wicked a black mark as indicating disgrace or dishonor and black market as a violation of official quotas or priorities in addition a white lie is an untruth of little importance or consequence while a black lie signifies mendacity at its worst in both dictionary and colloquial meanings black has become linkedup with all that mankind should eschew while whitein most instanceshas become the symbol of purity and goodness that we should embrace both as individuals and as a community these concepts cannot be considered accidental and undoubtedly would not exist in a society wherein whites were a minority historically these concepts have evolved as a result of the need of the dominant group to maintain social and economic relationships on the basis of inequality if its hegemony was to survive the white child in our society therefore becomes instilled with the prevailing thinking on race relations through language and this thinking is difficult to overcome once the roots of language have imbedded themselves into pliant minds the child carries into adulthood the various connotations mainly unfavorableof the word black that he has garnered through the years black sheep the term black sheep is utilized in all segments of our society to denote an individual who seems almost completely immobilized in his efforts to effect an adjustment to his environment that could result in fulfilling personal familial and community responsibilities oh hes the black sheep in our family is a common description of an individual commanding little status we might ask ourselves what would have happened if in the development of language the word white were used in describing an individual whose seeming irresponsibility society condemns our answer lies again in the relation of the word to the formation of racial stereotypes undoubtedly the white majority would not accept the infiltration of such a characterization into our language the acceptance of the term black sheep however assists in the creation of a stereotype of negro irresponsibility which has become so valuable to the advocates of prejudice black and white modern liberal and progressive movements whether in politics anthropology sociology or psychology stress the oneness of the human family this approach for example has become the basic philosophy of the united nations it is continually pointed out that human beings everywhere have the same basic needs and that variations in behavior are due to a very great extent to cultural differences social scientists generally agree that the things the peoples of the world have in common outweigh their differences the language usage of our particular society however does not seem to accept the conclusions of our social scientists in such usage black and white are considered opposites in describing personalities or events to paraphrase kipling our language patterns seem to be telling us that white is white and black is black and never the twain shall meet thus we say show it to me in black and white that is in all the different phases of the problem here we have an implication not of unity but of divergence the fostering of opposition through language can be responsible for lack of identification with the problems of minority groups the concept that the differences between peoples are greater than the similarities may become paramount at times this may not be discernible in mass movements for economic and political equality but may be revealed in the day to day relationships of negroes and whites in the large urban areas in which both groups are heavily represented language in a society does not develop apart from that societys historical economic and political evolution the interconnection of language with other forces can be best seen through its usage as a form of symbol pure language does not exist a word may have a particular meaning in a society and a totally different one in another in modem american life language has become the fulcrum of prejudice as regards negrowhite relationships its effect has been equally potent upon the overt bigot as well as the confused member of the public who is struggling to overcome conscious or unconscious hostility towards minority groups in the case of the negro language concepts have supported misconceptions and disoriented the thinking of many on the question of race and culture the concept of racial inferiority and the stereotyped thinking that accompanies it is one of the products of our current language usage described herein the entire area of semantics has been explored in recent years as it relates to propaganda of various types here however we are dealing with meanings of words that the semanticists often ignore the dictionary meanings that metamorphize into symbolic connotations because of their connection with the color of a minority group the semanticist may deal with abstract words like liberal reactionary banker or monopolist and stress that the dictionary meanings have been obliterated in a war of points of view the words dealt with in this article have infested our culture through both dictionary and pointsofview meanings they are in a sense more dangerous and more difficult to counteract than such abstractions as liberal or reactionary language is the mirror of a society reflecting its attitudes and thinking as a society changes its concepts through political action and education its language patterns may be modified thus in years to come the symbols black and white may no longer take on divergent meanings and much of the other terminology referred to in this article may become extinct in its place there may be substituted a more honest appraisal of color with a resultant favorable effect upon race relations until that time however the relationship of language to prejudice towards the negro will be of import to the social scientist working to meet the challenges arising out of the problems of race relations in present day america when douglas turner wards two short plays happy ending and day of absence opened in chicago critic glenna syse of the chicago suntimes provided a perfect illustration of both the dilemma of the negro playwright versus the white critic and of the fact that negro playwrights have no alternative but to turn to black audiences the dilemma has been dealt with by ward himself in the pages of the new york times and to some extent by addison gayle jr in negro digest january and by hoyt w fuller in african forum autumn and the progressive october but the problem of the black writer and the white critic is so important that it cannot be confronted too frequently indeed it must be dragged out again and again until finally the black writer understands the direction he must take and the black audience recognizes its responsibility to the black writer and to itself the white criticwell he will do what he has to do when he is not catered to when his opinions and his assumptions no longer have power over the black playwright but first a word about the authors two plays both plays are comedy satires with sharp jagged teeth drawing their substance and their thrust from the bittersweet reality of race relations as seen from the bottom side of the coin position then is of the essence here for it is position which ultimately draws the barrier between the playwright and the critic in happy ending two sisters maidsofallwork in the home of a rich white couple gloomily face the possibility of a divorce for their employers they are weeping and moaning at home when their young nephew a raging rascal of a militant finds them discovering the cause of their grief he launches forth into a tirade of reprimands evoking the shades of freedom now and relegating his aunts to the nether world of aunt tommies then just as he in disgust starts to leave all togged and debonair the aunts call him back and on the carpet with elaborate sarcasm the two women remind the young man that every thing he owns and enjoysfrom the clothes on his back to the thick steaks in the ice boxcomes from their rich white employers that in fact they have all been living in the lap of luxury for nine years on the largesse the white family unwittingly has bestowed upon the maids a divorce would spoil all that for it would break up the white family and force the aunts to find new jobs realizing all this the brash and roguish young nephew feels like shedding a few tears himself the happy ending of the plays title comes when the white employer phones and asks one of the aunts to come over and babysit announcing that he and his nymphomaniac of a wife have reconciled and that there will be no divorce in day of absence billed as a reverse minstrel show the comedy is broad and heavy the negro actors wear white faces and a few of them are wildly ingenuous a lilywhite young southern matron for example is played in bright blonde shirley temple curls and a sheer white nightgown the towns mayor expertly mugged by playwright ward is all southern colonel blimpy and blustery and one of the local gentry cruelly a prototype is a lazy drawling obscenity the plays proposition concerns the reaction among the whites in a southern town when all the nigrahs suddenly vanish panic and pandemonium garbage collects services go lacking households go unattended families cannot function industries grind to a halt hospitals are menacedthings fall apart in desperation the town even tries to borrow some nigrahs from some other town it is all a clownerie unapologetic buffoonerybut it whacks the funny bone and it drives home a deadly stiletto so what happened well the audiencewhich was about threefifths black on opening nightate it up they were practically rolling in the aisles but bright and early the following morning critic glenna syse gave the impression that she had attended a wake pronounced she okas satirethe subject is on target sitting pretty for a sharpshooter trouble is ward takes aim kills and then keeps shooting at the body he doesnt know how to develop his premise dramatically after his first volley he loses grasp instead of gaining momentum it just lies there and soon becomes tiresome tiresome tiresome for whom certainly not for the audience but then miss syse winds up her critique a pity the tiresomeness because his wards ideas are good but his execution is completely inadequate and unfortunately his olayers do more to handicap than ielp his material plain poppycock and she never once mentioned the hilarity in the audience however miss syse had given her real thesis away in the first paragraphs of her review and it actually was unnecessary to read through to the conclusion here is the way she began douglas turner ward is that uncommon combinationboth playwright and actorand he appeared in both capacities he proved among other things that he is a versatile and vigorous voice in the american theater but then came this there are far too few negroes acting in and writing for the american theater and that is one reason why wards contribution deserves special attention all the old crowing condescension in between her beginning and her ending miss syse glossed over the essence of the two plays she even judged day of absence as a more significant work when that evaluation is questionable for happy ending is rooted in hard fact day of absence is flight of fancy the first play suggests something of the ingenuous strategy negroes have had to fashion for survival while day of absence chiefly highlights the ironic need and the neurotic fixation white southerners have for the black pariahs among them significance too is subjective miss syses review appeared in the suntimes under a banner headline which proclaimed negro playwrightactors satires fail in execution that was at least a matter of opinion among the whites in the audience and it was a baldfaced lie for the blacks but there you are back where we started the black playwright and the white critic are residents of two different worlds clearly the worlds are moving no nearer together just as clearly it is useless for the residents of the one world to keep trying to impose their values and their views on the residents of the other world happy ending and day of absence speak to black people with the resonance of experience the tragedy is that too few black people will avail themselves of its melody and mirth but that is the greater part of the probl the history of the jazz v r ifa y musician in america is the history of the worst kind of oppression ever perpetrated on a group of people worse because the individuals being oppressed are undoubtedly highly talented persons worse still because they have always existed on the periphery of success they have seen their art make millions for others while they themselves starved or at best barely lived at a subsistence level and for many complex reasons as a group they have been unable to do anything about their condition they go on hoping for individual success hoping for that one chance to break through but it goes without saying very few of them ever break through the best of them die like charlie parker and herbie nichols tragic and broken men who spent the last days of their lives desperately seeking to reaffirm the validity of their art and dignitv a b spellman a young poet political analyst and music critic has attempted to tell the story of four of these men in the book four lives in the bebop business pantheon the four musicians are ornette coleman cecil taylor the late herbie nichols and jackie mclean spellman has allowed the musicians to tell their own stories and has himself been contented with writing an interesting introduction and with occasionally interpreting the personal comments of the musicians in a larger social context therefore it is not an accident that the experience of these four musicians is ramified not only throughout the lives of other black musicians and also serve as a microcosm of the experience of black america in general essentially it is the experience of rejection no they are asking for acceptance for some intrinsic value that they may have they have seen their legitimate attempts to develop a meaningful art thwarted by everyone from the manager in a night club to those white music critics who set themselves up as judges of black music and then begin to dictate what is right and wrong critics who approach the music with the usual white western prejudices this latter aspect of the problem for example has led cecil taylor to hold most of the critics in great contempt spellman quotes him as saying critics are sustained by our vitality from afar the uninformed egos evergrowing arbitrarily attempt to give absolutes often the absolutes are the classical norms of western music and have very little to do with what black musicians are attempting taylor points out that the critics often look for european derivatives in his music while overlooking references which grow out of his experience with afroamerican musicians like duke ellington milt jackson and miles davis the trouble was cecil explains they couldnt hear they are listening to the music from a culturally biased point of view this helps nobody and it incenses the musician driving him to a more bitter state of mind this is the aesthetic side of the question on the business side musicians are forced to work for incredibly low wages the record companies are really no help binding the artist to ridiculous contracts and further it has been asserted cheating on the royalties its all one large mess and the pain goes on and on when the breaks come they are never enough they couldnt possibly be since they are often obtained at the expense of artistic integrity and because of the particularly racist nature of american society the jazz musicians entry into the mainstream is untaken with mixed emotions further his relationship wth the establishment is not an equitable one several outspoken musicians like andrew hill a very talented pianist and musicianwriter archie shepp have pointed this out on numerous occasions the black musician is never presumed by white america to be on an equal footing with the classical performer another aspect of spellmans book which should interest us is the tendency towards social alienation which is characteristic particularly of the socalled new musicians this alienation is directly related to the social life of the artist and it is somehow related to the audience which is attracted to the music unlike black music of a few years ago this music is very often played in places more frequented by whites than blacks therefore around a musician like ornette coleman for example there exists a mystique founded primarily on the unstable interest of whites this statement is not intended to take anything away from colemans music it is intended more to put it into its proper social context although coleman has his musical roots in the honking blues sound of the forties and fifties his music is rarely played in the black community the reasons are both economic and social the most apparent hangup in this alienation is that here is an art which is forged out of souls of black people but which black people rarely have the opportunity of appreciating aside from the personal alienation that affects black artists there is the lack of economic security in the black community economics should not be viewed as the prime reason for this alienationthis tendency of our creative individuals to seek refuge in what leroi jones calls the liberated zones of the metropolis most of the black communities of america have not developed the cultural institutions that would sustain and develop a legitimate artistic expression part of the blame for this lies with the negro bourgoisie which for many sociohistorical reasons has not been persistent enough in turning inward on some of its own problems this leaves the musician ready prey to those outside of his group who will throw the slightest crumbs his way and it leads to the torture of a cecil taylor or an ornette coleman spellman has touched on this in his book and the substance of these remarks is reaffirmed in his discussions with all of the musicians represented the other two musicians herbie nichols and jackie mclean do not express the same sense of frustration as taylor and coleman that is these latter musicians express almost an existential aloneness that is not apparent in the lives of herbie nichols and jackie mclean and it is interesting to note that neither nichols nor mclean have had it any easier than coleman or taylor a partial explanation lies in the natural differences in personalities and life experiences otherwise the differences can be explained in the general direction of the art of these musicians the development of nichols and mclean is more closely tied to innovations in the jazz tradition and the concomitant social relations which relate to that tradition while for taylor and coleman there seems to be a tendency to depart from the tradition i say seems to be because i am certain that cecil taylor does not see himself as departing from the tradition of ellington monk and nichols but in artistic terms extending it what i am attempting to describe essentially is a tendency to socially escape from the wellsprings of the music which has its roots in the black community herbie nichols for all his employment problems is seen intermittently playing before black audiences spellman further points out nichols interest in the popular dance rhythm the mambo and his interest in african music on the other hand mclean was very much associated with the uptown scene in his early musical development and even now is active whenever possible in the social welfare of the community recently musicians and writers like archie shepp and leroi jones have referred to the music personified by ornette coleman and cecil taylor as revolutionary music i feel that this is an abuse of terms the music of archie shepp cecil taylor albert alyer ornette coleman and many other similarly orientated musicians is not revolutionary in any manner that is socially observable this music is exciting however and extremely artistic and it could stand on that alone the appellative revolutionary is not necessary however in order for this music to become tionary it must extend itself into the black community in a manner which heretofore it has failed to do it must mean to the community what the supremes the impressions and james brown now mean and it must have a direct bearing on the political and social life of the community the struggles of the community must somehow be mirrored in the music and in a manner that is readily felt by the people currently the only things revolutionary about the new music are its technical innovations and those are not enough four lives in the bebop business is a significant contribution to the literature of jazz nevertheless there is a need for a more definitive work the field is wide open with many important musicians fast fading into the past and no significant work which evaluates their lives and art spellmans book does not propose any solutions to the problems of the jazz musician and many of the musicians themselves are confused about what to do most of them see their problems from a purely individualistic point of view the problem becomes simply one of failure to obtain employment this is at base true there is also the question of race and the prejudiced manner in which the critical establishment evaluates the music all of this is in spellmans book but a way out of these problems is not so the question iswill more exceptionally gifted musicians like taylor coleman and mclean continue to subsist semirecognized by white america die unknowns like herbie nichols or will they rescue themselves through the unity of their numbers this was attempted once with the jazz composers guild which spellman speaks of but was perhaps a premature effort several young musicians eg milford graves and andrew hill have proposed constructive programs these go from financing musicianowned recording companies to establishing music institutes which could be supported by the community and as well receive funds from private and governmental sources but time is running out there are more and more musicians with no place to go it is also essential that the black_power movement begin to address itself to this whole issue of preserving and controlling the cultural products of the black community the movement must also give the artist a way of expressing his view of the world regrettably many people in the movement view the black artist with the same disdain as the overall white society spellman has helped us all by providing us with an intensely human look at four musicians who deserve far more attention than they are now getting four musicians whose lives have been marred by the appalling malaise of the american cultural scene the house hidden in a grove of fir trees was made of wood wetly painted so that the boards almost glowed in the dark because wood is so plentiful most of the people who lived in the community surrounding the forest preserve preferred brick houses only people living within the forest had wooden homes and they were few in number if the census takers knew of the familys existence mr mack the head would have been classified as a dragger since chopping down trees was illegal in the forest preserve he had to wait for a natural calamity such as a thunderstorm to uproot trees and shrubbery then he dragged the dead trunk or as much of the wood as he could chop and carry to his back yard once a year usually in the spring before the beginning of the tourist season mr mack took the animals and dolls he had carved from his dragging to the main craft shop in town the women who owned the shop were always pleased to see him his squirrels and pigs were very popular with people shopping for souvenirs driving through to the western states he never said anything other than to discuss prices and ask about the advance on his commission he never tipped his hat or said thank you or even called the women by their names but of course one could not expect too much from his kind no matter how respectable he lookedthe ladies knew that and when the customers asked about the artist the sisters were quick to point out that he was the towns talented negro citizen we get along with him awfully well the fatter of the women would say yes the other sister usually completed the dialogue we can count on seeing him once a year like clockwork i dont understand places like the south we never have racial trouble here mrs mack never came into town her last trip down the path occurred several springs ago mr mack brought the bicycle from under the leanto to drive to the hospital for the birth of their son alvin alvin one of two living beings they brought from mississippi died three days after birth her doctor could not understand what extinguished the babys thin cries when she had seen the stiff little body for the last time mrs mack heard the physicians talking in the corridor of the shining hospital its almost as if the little fellow was afraid to breathe one doctor said mrs mack shut her ears knowing that the doctor spoke the truth she could do nothing but be grateful that her infant son would be buried in this quiet land their other son called rabbit grew into a healthy child with long limbs like the trees he climbed now that he did not require careful attention her days were spent in cooking and in cleaning the housea house that belonged to her she seldom thought of her white family in mississippi the baby boys whose diapers she changed between cleaning and cooking were no longer a part of her mind ever since she and mr mack shut the cabin door for the last time she had succeeded in putting the town out of her thoughts the town with all of the pale faces that ruined her baby frightened and angered her but she and mr mack knew better than to become angry in their town at first they decided to stay hoping that holding him and cuddling him would make their son forget the circle of bright faces in the mississippi field he had come home from playing shirt torn pants caked with red dirt where the boys from town had sat him down and pinched his nose threatening to stop his breathing they had thrown him one from the other sometimes dropping him the way a child bounces a rubber ball by some miracle he had limped home letting the boys take with them his power to speak they could take no chances with other children a voiceless child is after all powerless so during county fair week when she was pregnant again and the whole town was beset with confusion they put on their best clothes left the furniture and starched uniforms in the cabin and walked into town at the bus station they purchased tickets to jackson a usual event all of their friends had relatives to visit there at the jackson bus terminal they walked straight to the map on the terminal wall mrs mack closed her eyes and pointed to the state where they would live when the bus arrived at the town they walked out of it feeling their way toward the forest preserve during the summer the weather was warm in the day life in the forest was like being at home except for sleeping on the leaves by the time fall came mr mack had begun building the house adding to the two rooms year by year a sturdy house he built he himself hauling the logs and painting them white somehow he had managed mrs mack never understood these things to tap a power line so that they had electricity for the small stove mrs mack did not mind the limitations candle light was a small fee for her own life and hers was a good life she was comforted with the thought that alvin was at peace in his new world and rabbit seemed to find some quiet in the woods away from the pale faces in his head if she had her way he would never meet any people of the other kind at least not until he was old enough to understand that some colors were naturally evil she could hear rabbit now in his own room banging the two tin cups the cups had been her measuring utensils until one day she dropped them and their clatter on the smooth floor entranced her son he refused to give up the cup and when he saw others of varying sizes he insisted on holding them in his chubby hands measuring the two people around him the din from the next room muffled by the wooden beams that separated the kitchen was a constant reminder that he was at home safe with her until he grew old enough to protect himself rabbit sat on the floor legs tucked underneath straddling a sunbeam from the open window his head faced the screen the afternoon sun warming his wide nostrils making his eyelids blink it was time to feed the bear mixing the milk from the box with the same brisk motion he had observed in his mother he poured the liquid air into the smallest cup bearlie would not open his mouth until he pushed a finger in the orange slit and forcibly brought the cup to the bears face he held the cup just so until bearlie had drunk he turned the cup slowly in the sunlight at once washing and rinsing the silver color bouncing in his hand he put the cup to his ear and listened to his mothers footsteps in the next room she would soon be in to look at him when the soft swish of her broom no longer scratched the floor boards her feet would thump toward him in the blue slippers he could feel her shadow behind him youre quiet today rabbit her voice was puffs of soft breath tickling the hair on his neck do you want to see the picture book no he did not want to see the picture book but because she would sit down beside him he would turn the pages his fingers walking slowly stopping at pictures until she grew tired and returned the ebony to the shelf come on in the kitchen with me she seemed to sing as she spoke standing at the door waiting he looked quickly at her then at the window comparing her to the sunlight beyond the sill then slowly he brought the chunky legs together and sprang up bouncing the bearlie in his arms will you pass the milk mrs mack her husband softly touched his wifes hand before he spoke she already had begun sliding the pitcher they did not need words between them for rabbit who should grow up knowing his parents had mister and mistress attached to their names they spoke rabbit was too busy shaking canned milk into his oatmeal turning the paste into soup to notice them mr mack had raised the spoon to his mouth when the strange noise made his hand tremble he looked at his wife to see if she had heard and found her eyes paralyzed his fear caught in her eyes surely no one had driven a car into their part of the forest preserve while they sat stiffened waiting to see if the noise resumed rabbit did not seem to hear the sound he continued stirring his cereal in wide swoops pouring syrup into little wells of oatmeal when he had finished his bowl scraping the sides with two flat fingers they had not heard the noise again the family finished the meal in silence days and nights were not counted each passing evening brought the darkness more quickly to their supper table the leaves were coming down sometimes in great bunches leaving the trees behind the grove arms up in the air his mother said the trees had to undress for the winter after a while he had come to believe everything that she told him whatever she said was always so soon the trees would be covered with green making the cool spots for him and bearlie away from the sun he was walking with bearlie stopping sometimes to wait for a quivering leaf then just when the red wrinkle was coming toward him the wind would blow away the leaf he was at the top of the hill now looking down at the path his father kept cleared of grass he saw the woman walking and knew immediately she was part of the strange noise he had heard past the trees he had listened to the crunch of leaves and twigssomeone walking who did not know his way around the woods she walked in sunlight and the bits and pieces of fallen sun were woven in her hair playing games there at once he wanted to reach out and touch the curls to see if the sun would rub off but something about her made him hush she was a strange kind of person such a funny color perhaps he had seen someone like her but his head would not bring the pictures from the whirring circles into focus if he reached out perhaps she would remember but she did not look up at his outstretched arm she walked past his fingertips toward his house then suddenly he ran determined to leave the stranger behind mrs mack was measuring oatmeal for muffins when she saw him running charging straight toward her he was clutching the bear so tightly all of the stuffing in one arm had coagulated near the top making a shoulder droop he was trying to show her something his eyes glancing at her sweeping the forest preserve and back at her something had frightened her baby she reached down to comfort him and saw the woman walking up the path toward them she pulled rabbit toward her and at the same instant used him to shield herself from the creature hush rabbit its all right see what you have done to my child her eyes carried even harsher words over rabbits head what do you want mrs mack spoke surprised at the strength of her own voice good morning the thin lips spotted with pink smiled im rosemarie langley from the county service we didnt know you people lived so deep in the forest goodness you really have a long drive into town mrs mack stood in her doorway we dont go but your husband comes in to sell his exquisite carvings he goes but we stay here we found out about you people through your husband one of our caseworkers clerks parttime at sears and saw your husband purchase a boys snowsuit just by chance she mentioned the suit to me and i started wondering why a snowsuit that big wasnt in school and here i am she was suddenly breathless but her teeth became bigger with each smile oh im not here officially today was such a nice day for a drive i parked the car by the picnic grounds and decided to try and find you people our boy doesnt talk so theres no need to send him to school might as well not go if he never says nothing miss langley took a step nearer the door have you had his hearing tested she asked for a moment she looked as if she might peer inside rabbits head he hears a lot of things we dont hear he just dont say nothing about them and we like him the way he is mrs macks voice was stubborn and with each step the caseworker took she retreated farther into the kitchen dragging rabbit on her apron may i come in miss langley asked looks like youre here already mrs mack was surprised at herself a second time at home she wouldnt dare talk like that to one of them but the woman did not pay attention to her curtness now that im here please may i sit down what lovely wood did your husband do the carving on this chair he made all of the furniture youre very fortunate to have such a talented husband is your son artistic too he likes to look at books and he likes to feed the squirrels when he gets older i guess hell learn to use a knife rabbit still had not looked up keeping very still while his mother smoothed his hair stroking away his fear the womans voice made a strange humming sound reaching into every corner of the kitchen when he comes to school of course hell learn to read and write then we can give him tests to see if he has an artistic bent he doesnt need to go to your school when he decides he wants to read the picture book one of us will teach him the words oh you mean youre educated miss langley colored her cheeks matching the pink lips i mean you and your husband went to school i can read a cookbook and he knows how to read a road map but all thats behind us now we dont have no use for your learning those we know who had it never had much use for us she smoothed her son from her apron youre sitting on his chair he dont like the others please move oh im terribly sorry she stood and fluffed the cushion she had crushed mrs mack picked up the shivering rabbit and sat him down perhaps warm cocoa would soothe him cocoa with a pink marshmallow floating on top she dragged his chair to the stove while she mixed cocoa together they watched the caseworker such a cozy little place do you mind if i look around miss langley pulled away from the table and rabbit immediately clutched his mothers skirts she pushed back the curtain only one bedroom thank heavens you have two beds she said shaking her head but do you really think thats wise having him sleep in the same room with you mrs mack felt herself blush shame on her for making such talk even if she didnt come right out and say her thoughts in front of rabbit its not good to have a child exposed to too much miss langley called from the bedroom why half the juveniles we have in court are there because they grew up too fast mrs mack continued stirring the cocoa the woman couldnt possibly think she preached something new the thing to do was not let them grow up at all keep them away from people who came prying looking into affairs not concerning them im fixing my baby some cocoa would you like some when the woman nodded she brought the cups from their hook and reached for the marshmallows my what handsome mugs i bet your husband carved those too the cocoa will take a while mrs mack answered rejecting the compliment she pulled a chair beside rabbit and again both of them stared at the intruder she had such pretty hair not knobby and crinkly like his mothers she wasnt even sitting near the door and it shone like his book when light fell on the pages his mother didnt like her either and she really had done nothing but walk into his room and other times she smiled at him the teeth locked together as if they guarded a big hole he dug his fingers into the arm of the chair wondering how bearlie would look covered with some of her hair he would like to take a single strand to cover bearlies gray fur then when night came the brightness of bearlies new coat could light the darkness around his bed he could smell the cocoa feel the bubbles bursting in the pan as if the cocoa had hiccoughs then his mother poured three cups and allowed him to reach first with the cup in his hands his tongue darted out to catch a precious drop oozing down the side into his palm thank you mrs mack it really smells delicious there was silence mrs mack watched the pale fingers pick up the cup and hoped she would burn her tongue why couldnt those people leave her family alone why did they always have to come inside when they were not wanted looking with icy eyes freezing everything trying to make everybody in the world like them every last one of them made her ill how old is your son nine going on ten why mrs mack do you realize that other children his age are halfway through the fourth grade theres nothing you can teach him that will help preserve him why mrs mack we try to turn our children into useful citizens surely his heritage is worth preserving rabbit looked from one to the other two bright shining eyes peering over the cup attached to his nose we have such a good group of parents who come to our family meetings perhaps you and mr mack might come we have an indian couple who go quite regularly im sure the others wouldnt mind you two at all she smiled at rabbit and mrs macks swallow of cocoa suddenly turned cold in her mouth mrs mack said nothing she wished the woman would leave truthfully she dared not wish her away she would only return with more of her own kind bringing the sheets of paper and asking questions while one of them marked mrs macks answers in little boxes out of her head came memories of the surveyswomen from town walking through her door after barely knocking holding their noses and brushing the chairs before they sat down she would not live through that time again she would not let them force rabbit to talk in their words with their reason her son was much healthier chasing pictures inside his own head he did not need this pale woman would you like some more cocoa goodness no this cup is still so hot i can hardly drink she smiled again mrs mack looked over at rabbit sitting drowsily in his chair the cocoa had made him relax his fat palms drooping over the arms of the chair its past his naptime she said shaking rabbit gently on the shoulder come on now lets go to bed may i help you tuck him in miss langley stood and waited to follow the boy and his mother she watched mrs mack turn down the sheet and slide rabbit between the covers my what an exquisitely carved bedboard she said dont tell me more of your husbands handiwork rabbit had fallen asleep his face on the pillow as static as the ducks and squirrels on his headboard mrs mack walked from the room the social worker tippytoed behind her good miss langley whispered when they had returned to the kitchen now we can talk you never can tell what little children might overhear she smiled with half her teeth hidden would suggest that you bring your son down to the county clinic early next week we can run some tests and if necessary enroll him in a special school why if the county has to send a social worker after you there could be all kinds of trouble mrs mack nodded watching her husband walk up the path straight to the back of miss langleys chair he walked silently accustomed to hunting small game now she watched him stop and sniff the air he could always tell when one of them was in the vicinity theyre not like us he always said they even smell different she watched him creep to the leanto on the side of the house where he stored the carving tools satisfied that she need not explain to him she turned her eyes toward miss langley my husband should be returning soon maybe you ought to talk to him at that moment mr mack walked through the door he put the bag of hazelnuts on the floor the wooden mallet he used as nutcracker was anchored on top im glad to see you mrs mack said this is miss langley she wants to bring rabbit down to the clinic and she wants us to go to some meetings miss langley turned her smile to face him she saw the heavy mallet coming down but even then her eyes did not believe he hit her four times because she was after all the fourth visitor i didnt think you were ever coming his wife said putting brown paper bags under the bodys head to catch the blood she began scrubbing the floor with soda before the stain set in the wood too bad robert had to see her he answered picking up miss langley im really sorry if id known she was here pestering you i d have come straight home he opened the screen door will you please bring the shovel its on the side of the house she finished scrubbing and carried the bucket to the porch toss ing the pail so that pink sudsy water melted into the ground they walked past the fir trees deeper into the forest preserve here he asked depositing the body on the ground she nodded and handed him the shovel at least this one is full grown she said remembering last winter when the boy with spotted glasses was lost from his hiking group he came to their door for something hot to drink cold to his toes he had said he was surprised to see people living in the middle of the woods and then mr mack knocked him unconscious dragging his body to the front yard the forest preserve was so large he knew the search party would not reach their part of the woods until morning by then he had carried the stiff body to a spot close to town the newspaper account that mr mack read said the boy apparently fell struck his head on a rock and wandered dazedly before collapsing he froze to death over night the other two did not matter they were old ladies hunting mushrooms and herbs so they said mrs mack watched her husband uncover the hole then drop the shovelfuls of dirt over the slender body completely covering the golden hair she wished he would hurry updarkness would soon catch them she had to get home and sweep the air out of the house anything she thought to remove that terrible odor before bedtime they say that she got ri on the train in chii cago after transferal ring from the dearborn station she was plump and matronly and her glasses were tinted so that she might have been a tourist seeking protection from the sun but there was neither sun nor fresh air on the train and she was very pale and very wrinkled the way clerks or indoor people grow after many years of their special protected colorless kind of life she was indeed that nondescript type of person one might be aware of but never really see in a supermarket or at a bargainbasement sale carefully and methodically fingering each item or on a busy streetcorner waiting for the light to change while others with less conscious respect for the letter of the law flowed around her she rode for a whole day before coming into the dining car for a meal she had the special she asked for buttermilk and wanted lightbread instead of rolls the negro waiters all grinned at each other in their secret way when she finished her meal she sat reading a book and looking out at the green flatlands of north dakota until the steward had to ask her to leave so that the waiters could clean up for the next setting she did not protest but left with an indignant flourish of her dress the automatic door to the car leading to the pullman section hissed angrily behind her the steward called her a bitch between his teeth and the waiter who had served her standing next to the steward with his tray under his arm grinned broadly showing his smokestained teeth but when he saw that she had left no tip he called her a cheap bitch aloud and the steward scowled at him after the last setting the waiters sat down to eat their dinner two pullman porters came in with their coffee cans begging for handouts they were very greedy and if given one can of free coffee would always come back expectantly for more as if they had been initially granted all that they could drink they sat down at the waiters table and watched them eat the waiters were very greedy too they ate ravenously the porters watched the waiters for a while then one of them closed his eyes and began to doze the other one an old fellow with eyes aged and tired like an owls looked out at the floating gold of the sunset across the passing wheatfields he watched until the fields became patterns of black and fading gold then he turned to the waiters we got a old southern gal back there he said we had her up here one of the waiters said between huge mouthfuls of beef she got good service but she didnt leave no tip she had me polishin her shoes the porter said but i dont reckon shell pay off when she gets off i didnt put much work out on it anyway he stretched his thin legs under the table they cracked with the sound of dead branches underfoot when it is autumn a woman in pants passed through the car her hair was cut somewhat like a little girls dutch boy and a ringlet of it curled against her cheek she blew at it out of the comer of her mouth and smiled knowingly at the men seated around the table which way to the club car she asked her lipstick was above the line of her mouth so that it looked like a red moustache she was not at all pretty and not at all young two cars ahead one waiter said she turned to go took a few steps and then looked back at the men the two waiters were looking her over one porter was still dozing and the other tired one was seemingly not aware of her how late does it stay open she asked and she tossed her hair batted her eyes and blew on the ringlet all in the same quick movement till twelve one waiter said chicago time the other one added they watched her move through the door shell tip big tomorrow one of them said yeah that old biddy knows where the club car is she been in there all day i seen her battin them greasy eyes at john perry on the bar maybe hell take care of business for her tonight the tired pullman porter said but there was no humor in it and all of their laughs were only polite if he does shell tip big tomorrow one of the waiters said again the porter with the owl eyes pushed the dozing porter time to get the beds down tim he said tim got up slowly and they took their full coffeecans and trudged down the aisle toward the pullman section as they reached the door it opened and the lady who had transferred from dearborn came into the car the two porters stood on either side of the aisle and let her pass between them they wore white jackets with silver buttons which were engraved pullman company together with their black caps with silver plates which also read pullman company and black pants they looked like two painted black statues before the entrance to some fine suburban home she did not notice them but passed silently through the car leaving a scent of something sweet and strong when she entered the club car the woman with the dutch hair was sitting at the bar talking to john perry the bartender who stood behind the bar leaning with his arms on its waxed red surface they were very close and the dutch woman was smiling awkwardly there was no one else in the car the dearborn lady took a table near the far end of the car and began to stare at john perry as he said something low and soft and smileprovoking to the painted thing on the stool across from him the dearborn lady cleared her throat john perry placed his dark thick hand closer to the other softer hand on the bar and did not look up the painted lady made a throaty chuckle like the confusing sound one might hear near a car parked by a frog pond on a summer night i want some service the lady at the end of the car finally said ive been here for ten minutes and i want some service the man looked annoyed as he went over to her table whatll it be lady he said his voice was deep and smooth and almost as greasy as the painted womans lips and it had that familiar ring of professional servitude which is peculiar to small serving people who like their work i want a brandy a benedictine no benedictine this is a train lady she paused ill have a creme de menthe then we dont have that neither try bourbon and water honey the woman at the bar said and she lifted her glass for the lady to see he makes it very good im gonna have another one myself she looked at the bartender as she pushed a fivedollar bill across the bar make yourself one too she told him the lady at the table looked at her fiercely she finally took a rose and settled back taking turns watching the immediate reflections of the two at the bar in the window next to her face and the darkness of the passing countryside beyond their reflections the train lumbered on and it made the only noise save for an occasional giggle and a deepthroated chuckle from the bar finally the woman got up from the stool and said see you later on to the bartender she said it with a contrived unnatural seductivity and she let her waving arm follow her out of the car the dearborn lady still seated at the table and facing the window saw it all through her tinted lenses the bartender began to whistle as he washed the glasses he was a robust fellow but he moved very gracefully behind the bar like a dancer still he splashed a great deal of water on the floor he glanced over at the lady once or twice as she in turn looked alternatively at the darkness beyond the thick window glass and at him but only her eyes moved then the man moved out from behind the bar and came toward her she stiffened and gathered her purse and got up all very quickly he was wiping the tables and whistling as she hurried out of the car in the pullman car the porter was still making the beds he shuffled from one roomette to the next not wasting a single step the occupants came out of their rooms and stood in the hall while he swished and tucked their sheets then he knocked on the dearborn ladys door porter he barked the way a street corner concessionaire would say hot dogs there was no answer so he went in and began turning down the bed she came up behind him and watched his back as he moved about the small compartment she was breathing very hard what time do you lock the doors to the car she asked the doors aint never locked he said not turning to face her how do you keep people out my luggage is in the hall its very expensive watch out for it i sit up all night inside the car yes mam but i we have to sleep we have to sleep in here she said she was very excited yes mam he did not stop his work nor did he look at her but answered her questions and made the bed with the proficiency and cool detachment of one used to confronting stupidity in the intelligent it was bargained and paid for in the price of her ticket and his was a patient and polite endurance of her right to be stupid im a pullman porter he said i been a pullman porter for fortythree years he had finished the bed and he smoothed down a light ripple in the red blanket his hands were rough and wrinkled and the backs of his fingers were very black fortythree years he repeated reminiscently half to himself she could not see his eyes well you cant stay in here tonight she said and moved back into the small compartment as if to possess it entirely with her presence the porter backed out its my job he said she was very nervous now and ran her hands lightly over the sides of her dress her hands stuck to the thin silk you go get the pullman conductor i can talk to him she began to pace up and down the little length of the room the porter returned in a few minutes with the pullman conductor the bluesuited conductor entered the compartment while the porter stood outside the door and watched them his dark old eyes flashing from one face to the other he sits up in the car lady the conductor said its his job he has to be here if anyone rings for him at night the conductor was very irritated he had already started to undress for bed and his tie hung loosely about his neck the lady was perspiring now and the little beads of sweat glistened on her temples in the glare of the white light overhead i cant and i wont sleep in the same car with that that gentleman thats your business if you dont sleep lady the conductor said he stays in the car the conductor was very mad now the lines in his forehead grew very red and his nose which was large grew even larger and redder we have a right to sleep here without these people coming in doing things whats he done to you lady hes black hes black and she said it with the exasperation and utter defeat of an inexperienced teacher whose patience has been exhausted and who can only stamp the right answer into the mind of a stupid child hes a porter the conductor said the porter who stood all the while like a child waiting for punishment seemed to droop and wither and grow smaller and his eyes which had only minutes before flashed brightly from the face of the conductor to the enraged face of the lady now seemed to dull and turn inward as only those who have learned to suffer silently can turn their eyes inward he was a very old man and he grew older even older than his occupation or the oldest and most obsequious pullman porter people were looking out of their compartments and the dearborn lady hearing them raised her voice in a plea he sleeps in here he sleeps in here with us she shouted to them down the hall the painted woman opened the door to compartment g and listened and smiled and shook her head and then closed the door again and the rest listened and weighed the thought which was a new one deserving some consideration but the conductor said that it was necessary for comfort and they agreed for the most part and returned to their rooms only the porter stood outside the door looking guilty it was finally decided that the dearborn lady would take a seat in the coaches for the night she wanted it that way the porter would sleep as he had always slept sitting up in the back of the car with his eyes closed and his mind awake and his coffee can by his side and the small bright nightlight over his bowed head and his ear next to the buzzer in case someone should ring everyone agreed that it was the way things should be it was necessary for comfort and besides it was his job and later that night when john perry the bartender who danced and splashed a great deal of water when he washed glasses stole into the dark sleeping car he paused for a minute before the bent old man on the hard porters seat the coffee can had fallen over on the seat and john perry picked it up and placed it on the floor next to the old mans feet then he knocked very softly on the door to compartment g and after a while it was opened and quickly closed behind him in the final months of writers assemsembled on the campuses of two predominantly negro colleges and at a conference on racism in cetirs american education and in at least one instance the sparks flew at the american federation of teachers confab on negro history in washington novelist william melvin kelley electrified a gather ing of several hundred teachers by telling them bluntly that there is no hope for american education mr kelleys thesis developed to the obvious dismay of many of his listeners revolved around the murderous nature of american society he said that the early americans resolved to slay all the indians they could get their hands on then went on to take texas and southwest territory from the mexicans then invaded cuba and nicaragua and santo domingo and china dropped atomic bombs on japan massacred koreans and vietnamese start with a society that can rationalize genocide and slavery in the name of progress in the name of god in the name of christianity in whatever way and then gets away with it and you will have a society that can rationalize anything at all he said the killing of one million indonesians in the name of anticommunism or the dropping of not just one but two atomic bombs america scored another firstandonly there too with all the talk about what china will do or russia will do america is the only country that has done it in the face of the fact that none of the ugly facts he had cited were ever taught in american history mr kelley said to the teachers its not your fault what you have done would be too much for any group of human beings to face so you will go on and on killing and justifying that killing that is my view of an honest american history not a matter of hidden facts but of interpretation john henrik clarke one of the other writers on the panel writers look at history managed to shock the teachers by dismissing white teachers as being ineligible to teach negro history to black children that raised a storm of protest and mr clarke was forced to backtrack a few steps after all one of the chairmen of the program committee for the conference was a white person a young woman who has successfully taught negro history in the public schools and colleges of illinois the other two writers on the panel were novelist ronald fair many thousands gone hog butcher and critic robert a bone the negro novel in america both men dealt with the problem of historical balance mr fair from the contemporary perspective and mr bone from the historical viewpoint at alabama a m college down near huntsville the redoubtable rosey e pool mounted the little colleges second writers conference she organized and directed the first one in the writers on hand this time around were mostly poetssamuel allen paul vesey margaret burroughs dudley randall and mari evans who was a repeater poet margaret danner also appeared as a special guest of the threeday sessions miss pool is the anthologist and editor responsible for beyond the blues and l am the new negro a londoner by choice she is a native of holland she is an energetic traveler and teacher the fall semester at alabama a m was her second semester there as a special member of the faculty her title this time was visiting professor of literature early this year she took off for south america the other campus conference took place at lincoln university in pennsylvania and the writers who participated were novelist john oliver killens playwrights ronald milner and loften mitchell and essayistcritic wilmer f lucas negro digest editor hoyt w fuller acted as conference moderator the lincoln conference interestingly was organized by dr charles hamilton who is chairman of the political science department and there were no members of the english department noticeably present during the conference the exceptions it should be added were two members of the conference itself mr milner who is serving as writerinresidence and mr lucas who is a visiting professor of english at both alabama and lincoln the old dilemma of art versus activism raised its gray head though somewhat wearily it was never much of an argument at alabama although it did raise a few hackles at lincoln some black writers persist in the doctrine which in essence states that they are just writers not negro writers meaning usually that they are free of the necessity of thinking of themselves as negroes their opposites feel that they protest too much that in a racist society as this one surely is a writer who exists as just a writer and not a negro writer is about as natural as a threeheaded heifer it is always interesting though that the division among the writers relative to this dilemma finds the young and youngthinking writers on the side where art and activism pose no problem of conciliation the alabama conference had the advantage of a captive audience since the appearance of the writers on the campus signalled a major event for the plenary session students from surrounding schools were bused in to hear the writers many of the students have rural backgrounds and their exposure to sophisticated writers from the nations big urban centers proved stimulating the story was somewhat different at lincoln no effort had been made to persuade the students to attend the conference in fact it was held on a saturday precisely the day when most of the students had abandoned the campus for the weekend dr hamilton indicated that this had not been inadvertent he was much more interested in having students attend the conference because they wanted to the turnout was small but enthusiastic and some very real questions were put to the writers both during the panel discussion and during the small group discussions which followed one of the amusing things revealed during the lincoln conference was the existence of an underground movement aimed at overthrowing the name of the institution certain of the students want to change the name from lincoln university to frederick douglass university after all said one of them theres a lincoln university in missouri and were willing to give them exclusive rights to the name last december some to teachers and laymen concerned with the problem of bringing view of history into american education assembled in washington for a threeday conference auspices of the american federation of teachers it was a historic event for the first time since public education was established in the nation an interracial group of educators of power and influence openly challenged the traditional approach to the teaching of american history and reolved to exert their power and influence to begin the overthrow of the traditional a virtual galaxy of cont porary scholars and historians dressed the conference on vari cp i osor of sociology at roosevelt university and sterling brown professor of english literature at howard u other speakers were ossie davis the actorplaywright and lerone bennett jr ebony magazine senior editor both of whom were conference conveners and keith baird a new york educator and haryouact official the spade work for the conference was done in chicago headquarters for the teachers union by a conference committee headed by benjamin solomon as temporary chairman the committee included arthur l reese director aft civil_rights dept carolyn reese materials chairman and sterling stuckey and beatrice young program chairmen other members of the conference committee were lydia lewis publicity william simons host chairman sidney harris attendance and bernard flicker and margaret s webb resolutions a bonus feature of the conference was an opening night general session on writers look at history the writers were novelists ronald fair and william melvin kelley critic robert a bone and editoressayist john henrik clarke and their perspective on history and the problem of adjusting it proved more than a little provocative kelley for example stated flatly there is no hope for american education panel discussions organized with the presence of consultants followed the major addresses and suggested resolutions were invited from all participants in the conference in the end the conference passed a resolution calling for the discarding or boycotting of all textbooks which neglect or distort the role of afroamericans in the history of the nation it did not simply resolve to do this the conference also provided those in attendance with materials and sources of materials which could help them in achieving the task of redressing the balance of history in school texts the conference was held at the washington hilton hotel malcolm_x was three menmalcolm little malcolm_x and malik elshabazz as young ulqjy little he was by his own confession a harlem hustler and criminal converted by the black muslims when in prison he was malcolm_x one of elijahs fiercest disciples falling out with elijah muhammad and after visiting africa and mecca he became malik elshabazz a muslim not black muslim prophet as malcolm little he asserted his personality by attacking the white world and robbing it as malcolm_x he rejected whites completely and sought to be a savior of his people not just a political savior but one of individual defeated negroes then in mecca he realised that mankind is one family from which no race not even white devilsis excluded having believed and said this he was shot dead in his prime it is this intellectual and moral evolution that makes malcolm heroic most of us if negroes would never have passed beyond the stage of criminal revolt some might have moved on to the second stage of personal puritanism political militancy and race hatred but few could go on to accept as malcolm did a dangerous paradox that negroes must fight every inch for their rights but not yield to the white crime of racialism malcolms negro detractors believe that in rejecting black racialism he rejected his people his white liberal enemies think that in becoming a muslim convert he was escaping from black muslim neuroses into the comfort of an exotic faith i think malcolm never denied his people for a second but saw that their cause could only be advanced within a context wider than that of u s negro politics with his contacts in africa malcolm founded an organisation for afroamerican unity believing that the black struggles in africa and america were one from these emerged a tentative black nationalist movement which rejected black and white dogmatism there is no reassurance for whites in malcolms life when he was a harlem layabout they used him fixing kicks for whites was his specialty when he was a black muslim they feared and hated him when he turned to mecca they saw he was rejected by his people and despised him but for those with eyes to see he left a message for dark eyes it is threefoldthat only militancy will win that the worlds black struggle is indivisible that hatred is valid but not if it leaves the hater with only his hate for blue eyes the message is that blacks will never again be satisfied with concessions promises or gifts by conventional standards his life was a failure firstly because the whole fight of the american negro has hitherto been a failure next because the white americans have also failed disastrously to live with colored americansand since malcolm was very american he shares this failure last because in a mundane sense he never got anywhere but his example and influence are germinal for the prime american problemand perhaps world problemis the racial one the death of a hero has a rightness a perfection if a white had killed malcolm there would have been a riotthen oblivion but his own people killed him because they could not bear what he was demanding of them and then the whites sighed in relief and the blacks knew this was a desecration they had killed themselves martin_luther_king jr having conquered the montgomerys birminghams and selmas of the south made a momentous m decisionchicago the challenge of this great northern ghetto was considered by most civil_rights leaders as insurmountable nevertheless king announced his determination to make an allout effort to shake the foundation of the slums and the powers that held negroes captive mayor richard daley shook and quivered in anger at this blatant intrusion into the affairs of his city he was not alone in making his decision king was obviously aware that chicago contained more than slums and housing discrimination it also contained one of the most controversial negro leaders in the nationdr joseph harrison jackson chicago was to become the battleground between two men whose individual philosophies and activities had already split the negro masses in general and the national baptist convention usa inc in particular with the arrival of dr_king dr jackson immediately took him to task as the push to eliminate the slums and institute a program for open housing began jackson utilized radio press and television to deplore the activities of the protest movement his attacks did not go unnoticed and he suddenly became the hero of backlashers and black conservatives the summer of was long and hot a water sprinkler became the cause of riots and national guardsmen were called in to quiet the racial storm when king was accused of being an outsider disturbing the peace of the city jackson agreed while king was urging negroes to unite in soldier field jackson was urging them to stay at home as the religious leader of an estimated negroes jacksons voice pricked the momentum that king had hoped to develop history was playing a repeat performance the kingjackson feud was in spirit a replay of the booker t washingtonwilliam e b du bois conflict this time the theater was chicago and the two new actors were ready to give sterling performances in the roles washington and du bois had originally created unknown to many the chicago competition between king and jackson can be considered the final act act i scene i took place years ago in miami florida where the national baptist convention usa inc convened to select its new leader trying out for the part and winning the role was its current president who today holds that convention in a powerful ironclad grip joseph harrison jackson is a spellbinding orator friends and critics alike accord him to be one of americas great preachers he successfully utilized this talent to lift himself to one of the highest offices in the world of negro religionpresident of the national baptist convention usa inc winning the presidency after a stormy all night session in it was considered at the time that his election gave promise of a new type of leadership he came to that helm when dynamic and constructive leadership was in demand we want jackson was the cry of the delegates and they got him for the past years they have had him in the early years of his presidency jacksons followers and admirers were legion some of the strongest negro ministers in the nation were among his followers and believers north south east and west men like j pious barber editor of the national baptist voice j raymond henderson california gardner taylor new york martin_luther_king sr atlanta marshall shepard philadelphia and dr benjamin mays president of morehouse college jacksons comer initially was crowded with intellectuals today none of these men are with him because one by one they deserted his camp the causes for desertion are many however two of the most important were jacksons reluctance to give up his office and his power plays to remain and his strange position on civil_rights during the years of the negro revolt act iichange scenes at the time of dr jacksons election a small wiry unknown youngster named martin_luther_king jr was developing his theology at crozier theological seminary in philadelphia pa unknown to him and to others at that time was the fact that his name would soon challenge the very structure of the conventional negro church and its leadership after the montgomery alabama bus boycott and the rise of martin_luther_king jr into international fame a new hard look was in order for negro leadership creative protest became the order of the times to negro activists jackson was not among this group although in the past jacksons voice had been one of many raised in eloquent protest against injustices perpetuated against negroes in the south no one could say it like joseph harrison jackson however the activist movement and the philosophy of king soon would divide the ministers into two camps the first issue that brought a schism was the issue of tenure the story of tenure in the national baptist convention usa inc was oddly enough closely allied with the fight for civil_rights from the organization of the convention in and for a period of years only men had served as president of these five had served one year one had served two years and one had served three years the remaining years found four men in strong control of the negro baptists rev w j simmons rev e c morris rev l k williams and dr d v jemison during the late years of dr jemisons term a movement was begun to install young and progressive leadership joseph h jackson was elected one strong plank presented in his campaign limited his term to only four years this modern approach to leadership was accepted by thousands of ministers who had desired for years to free themselves from oneman domination a new article was placed in the constitution as insurance against betrayal the revised constitution read as follows article iv officers election section a president of this convention shall not be eligible for reelection after he has served four consecutive terms or until at least one year has elapsed in the delegates were stunned when a jackson supporter stood on the floor to make a motion that this revision of the constitution be declared null and void when president jackson responded by selecting a committee to examine the constitution voices began to be raised among the voices was that of dr l k jackson the fiery minister from gary indiana he immediately condemned the administration as being immoral for tampering with the constitution dr martin_luther_king sr still a strong supporter of jackson demanded that l k jackson apologize to the convention for the strong language he had used l k jackson refused in denver september the auditorium where the convention met was in a tempest the speakers platform was crowded with ministers from both sidesthose who wished to retain tenure and those who wished it to be declared null and void as the argument rose president jackson rapped for attention he was ignored with a rare display of emotion the president declared that the delegates could have the convention and made an angry exit the lights were turned off in darkness delegates began to stomp and yell for the president to return and restore order jackson would not reappear and the session was at a stalemate in september the convention met in a dingy auditorium in louisville ky this was the session that supposedly would decide the issue the lines were clearly drawn the question of the hour would j h jackson be eligible for reelection or would another leader be chosen both contentions were set forth jacksonites insisted that the tenure provision was null and void because when the convention voted for it it did so illegally it was voted on the wrong day they claimed and that left the constitution as it originally was a president could succeed himself as many times as possible they pointed to the constitutional article that supported their stand this was the legal clincher that the jackson forces held while conceding the fact that it was voted in violation of the constitution the progressive forces contended that the spirit of the constitution was as the majority directed it was the majority wish to have tenure it was not a legal issue they argued it was a matter of ethics jackson should declare himself ineligible as a candidate and rule on the validity of tenure as the convention waited with hushed voices jackson promised to settle the issue once and for all first he quoted from the opinion of a t walden convention attorney based upon my understanding of the ordinary meaning of the word we should think that the amendment tenure would not be properly adopted president jackson then referred to roberts rules of order he quoted any measure adopted contrary to the constitution of the body is null and void therefore said the president in light of the record which shows that the socalled revised constitution was adopted on the wrong day i rule that the socalled revised constitution is null and void and the only valid constitution that the convention has is the constitution of jackson thus ruled himself back into office as his last words fell all hell broke loose and no one could stem the tide amid cries no no no ministers broke down and wept the jacksonites broke into cheers and shouts fists were raised and the air literally shook with rage delegates were on their feet propelled by the tension and disorder rev q l jones then pastor of the fourth street baptist church owensboro ky swung into action trucks had been waiting outside with banners for jackson with a trained crew of delegates jones swept into the auditorium with regal banners proclaiming jackson for president preceded by a bass drum the marchers snaked victoriously around the auditorium a struggle was made for the microphone and the jackson forces commandeered it i move that we suspend the rules and reelect our president by acclamation shouted dr t s harten of brooklyn all those in favor say aye directed another one of the vicepresidents a second wave of anger struck the antijackson forces the election was being called for a full day before it was programmed the jackson people were going to take advantage of the noise and turmoil and declare a reelection by acclamation it was an old convention trick so strong were the voices raised on both sides that the ayes could not be distinguished from the nays both blended into an indistinguishable roar the ayes have it screamed the moderator of disorder and have it they did the jackson forces had broken the back of tenure what had brought about this bid for power on jacksons part critics claim it to be a messianic complexa desire to be considered the deliverer of the negro masses as pastor of the great olivet baptist church in chicago j h jackson lived for power and recognition they said then enters martin_luther_king jr in denver colorado a beaming president led a shy young man down the aisles to the strains of onward christian soldiers it was an inspiring sight president jackson introduced young king to the convention in glowing terms king was at the peak of his popularity and captivated the audience his brilliant address on that occasion letter to america was masterfully delivered his father martin_luther_king sr strode with pride at the back of the auditorium as he listened his pride in his son would not allow him to sit down he glanced around at the delegates to see the effect his boy had upon them what he saw there was the same thing that joseph harrison jackson sawa possible black moses the crowd did not want to let the young man go from that moment negro baptists had an idol martin_luther_king had added the national baptist convention usa inc as another of his conquests critics of jackson point to this as the moment jackson made his decision to remain at the helm of the negro baptists the fact that king posed a threat to jacksons popularity was unquestioned a new day was dawning in the struggle for civil_rights and the technique of active protest was beginning to bear fruit and to capture the imagination of the nation king had done what no other negro had done up to this time he stood as the symbol of negro solidarity one of jacksons critics rev joseph kirkland of philadelphia stated in denver after listening to king jackson felt his power slipping from his grasp that plus the issue of tenure warned him that he was facing oblivion rev owen d pelt statistician of the convention and a long time jackson supporter rejected this type of thinking on the contrary he stated king merely echoed the philosophy that jackson had been preaching for years besides jackson was too intelligent to become a victim of petty jealousy whatever the reason the impact of king was sufficient enough to cause a groundswell toward new leadership the indecisive status of tenure helped to create the swell kings supporters recognizing the potential political power that he could exercise within the convention jockeyed him into position to compete for leadership the next year at the annual sunday school and btu congress kings name was offered in nomination for the vicepresidency of that body his popularity was made evident when all candidates for that office withdrew in his favor it was apparent to all that king was being groomed to take over the convention today neutral observers say it was unfortunate that king and jackson were thus pitted against each other many men who backed king were bitter fading ministers who feared that jackson would destroy their own ambitions for leadership the young supporters of king began a campaign against jackson on the charge that he was like uncle tom jacksons leadership was discredited as being weak on civil_rights and strong on dictatorship by the same token king came in for criticism his role many contended was too large to enable him to enter factional denominational considerations as a world renown figure he was diminishing his standing by playing the part of a conventional churchman he didnt need the convention nor did the convention need him in the years following jacksons reelection the conflict of philosophies concerning the struggle for human rights broke out even jacksonites were surprised when jackson allegedly made a statement condemning sitin demonstrations whereas there had always been supporters for jackson and supporters for king a third group of uncommitted ministers were able to view both men in perspectivejackson as a church man and king as a negro leader of the masses it was this third group that began to drift away from jackson jackson insisted that he was quoted out of context what he had really said he argued was that protest was not enough what still remains a mystery is why jackson had miscalculated the mood of the day the angry reaction that set upon him threatened to shake the foundation of his administration a progressive movement in the convention began to develop in the entire nation was caught up in the negro rebellion this was the mood of the day the negro church had entered the fray with enthusiasm it was against this backdrop that j h jackson began his own delayed program of freedom first he presented to the convention a plan to buy farmland in tennessee during the tent city crisis the purpose was to aid negro farmers in gaining independence from the white man this plan was labeled by the progressives as a booker t washington approach which history records as let down your buckets where you are his critics seized upon this new jackson venture with relish old man jackson has a farm they chanted it was ironic they contended that in an age of sitins wadeins and standins jackson dared to stage a farmin the next venture by dr jackson in support of his protest is not enough thesis was to export negro families to liberia to teach the people of that country by example how to live and farm as christians followers deserted him in droves as he seemed to focus his attention on farms rather than on the immediate problems of the day ironically jacksons proposals coming at any other time in history would have probably met with unanimous approval however with the intense struggle for civil_rights taking place and virtually no support from the jackson administration he was exhibiting a masterful flair for illtiming leadership was lying heavily upon his shoulders jackson fought hard to gain attention with steady lack of success in june he amplified his position on protest is not enough with his now famous address the american struggle in the american way this address was called by the progressives a masterpiece of tomism while the civil_rights movement shook up america the national baptist convention usa inc waited by july lunch counters had been integrated since the start of the sitins the convention waited while core opened its interracial training institute on nonviolence in miami florida nine southern states reported cities with integrated eating facilities in midaugust by this time martin_luther_king jrs name had become a household word the original idea of his assuming leadership in the conventional negro church was discarded his pulpit became every city that called upon him to inspire negro youth and to challenge the imbedded structure of segregation and discrimination defiantly he marched against police dogs and fire hoses with thousands behind him he was led time and time again to jail his appearance at any gathering electrified both the imagination and the aspiration of the negro masses as a statesman he had quietly ignored the rapierlike thrusts from his erstwhile rival at the same time jacksons lack of support for the revolution was not ignored by young progressive churchmen in every major city of the nation meetings were held alliances and strategy were formed and outlined a new battle cry was formulated jackson must go now dr gardner taylor preparing for the big push to oust jackson added his voice to those of the militants tomorrow libraries parks theaters will face the same choice integration or disintegration it appeared that time for the doctrine of patience had passed after successfully riding through his second fouryear term dr jackson prepared to make his stand for another term philadelphia the city of brotherly love was chosen as site of the next election the progressives conceding that jackson would run again searched for and found a new candidate gardner taylor pastor of the member concord baptist church brooklyn n y was their man like jackson he was a gifted orator and an attractive candidate some jackson supporters tried in vain to get taylor to withdraw as a candidate he was warned that if he was defeated his chance of ever becoming president was gone he was young they informed him he still had time let jackson have another four years taylors day would come gardner taylor was cast in the mold of a fighter he was the first negro member of the new york city board of education he was also the first negro president of the new york state council of ministers tall handsome and militant he was tailor made as a jackson opponent a major attraction was his identification with martin_luther_king jr by this time young king was the leader of the southern christian leadership conference the clamor for king as possible president of the convention had long since diminished prior to the annual session in philadelphia jackson and taylor skirmished briefly at the sunday school and btu congress once again jackson was expounding on his favorite theme patience as the delegates flocked to the new battlefield in philadelphia it soon became apparent that the taylorking forces were strong philadelphia was the political stronghold of rev marshall shepard former state legislator and recorder of deeds in washington d c shepard was an avid worker and arranger for taylor and he worked against jackson with a passion he had reason to jackson had disposed of him as chairman of the foreign mission board taylor was also supported by dr sandy ray president of the new york state convention these large eastern voting blocs far removed from jacksons political strongholds of the south and midwest were watched with deep anxiety by jackson supporters both sides immediately sought ground rules for the election the electoral procedure which had been customary was deplored by the taylor team this procedure worked in the following manner after the president would make his annual address a vicepresident would make a motion that the rules be suspended and the president would be reelected by acclamation the progressives claimed that this method was unfair undemocratic and had steamroller elements give all the delegates the right to cast ballots they contended and let their votes be recorded as they vote by states the agreement was made all delegates were informed that the election would be conducted by states the ground rules worked out by both parties likewise included an agreement that the nominating committee selected by the president would bring in two namestaylor and jacksonand the delegates would then vote for the man of their choice the taylor team was ready the jackson forces were waiting and the events that followed were almost unbelievable on tuesday contrary to the supposed agreement concerning the dual submission of names by the nominating committee the taylor forces were caught offguard when the committee reported only one name j h jackson moving quickly before the delegates could retain their balance the committee went on without asking for nominations from the floor they moved that their report be adopted with a unanimous vote for the reelection of jackson this maneuver must be viewed from two positions the body had voted earlier that the election would be by states and the report was made prior to the time of the schedule outmaneuvered and betrayed the taylor team resorted to the only means of protest leftbedlam we want taylor we want taylor they chanted in unison we want to vote and we want to vote by states they chorused someone cut the microphone cord jackson turning to the large choir ordered them to sing the chanting grew louder accompanied by the songs of the church churchmen were on a rampage jackson facing a dead microphone attempted to read his annual address and everyone knew that the election would follow this address sit down the taylor contingent shouted we dont want to hear you we want to vote and we want to vote by states they screamed in the middle of his opening statement the premature report of the nominating committee had set up the tempest it was clear to the taylor team what had to follow they moved to prevent it as jackson attempted to deliver his annual address a bass drum was brought in and taylor banners were marched behind the booming drum taylor balloons were released the president struggled to be heard but after a few sentences he realized the utter futility of going on and skipped to the end paragraph he read with a flourishbut it was unheard the coup de grace followed during the bedlam a motion was offered that the report of the nominating committee be received and adopted what followed this motion will never be clearly determined those who were standing close to the platform heard the motion and meanwhile the majority of the delegates were still shouting we want taylor remembering that the mike was dead and with the delegates in turmoil it was surprising to all when the news spread that jackson had been reelected alice dunnigan reporting the scene for the pittsburgh courier described the proceedings as follows the place was in such a hubbub that no one knew what was going on martin_luther_king approached the press table to inquire about the reelection of jackson he was startled when reporters sitting directly in front of the platform replied that there had been no election there must have been retorted king i just met rev jackson leaving the hall and he told me he just had been reelected this raised an inquiry among the reporters as to how and when the president had been elected when the news shifted back to the crowd that the election was over a jackson vicepresident was rapping the convention into adjournment until the evening session the angered taylorites increased the fervor of their demonstration it was at this point that jackson left the hall and notified king he had been reelected gardner taylor standing tall in the midst of his supporters yelled after jacksons retreating form the worst days of hitler never matched this if negroes stand for this they will let the world know they are not prepared for leadership but they will not stand for this they will have an election god help us prayed an old minister the taylorites with jackson gone moved quickly this meeting is not adjourned shouted dr sandy ray please hold your seats this meeting is not adjourned he repeated this over and over again we are going to have an election and were going to vote by states a roar of approval went up from the delegates jackson meanwhile had locked himself in his convention office reporters seeking to interview him were hustled off by his bodyguards alice dunnigan further reported some persistent reporters hung around the door and buttonholed the selfappointed president as he departed for his hotel he assured reporters that his election had been conducted legally under the terms of the conventions constitution he blamed dr marshall shepard the philadelphia counselman for the disorder implying that shepard had declined to keep order in the hall declaring that the city of brotherly love was the most inhospitable city in which the convention had ever met he stated that it would never come to philadelphia again as long as he was the president while jackson was making his declaratory statement the delegates were filing in arranging themselves by states and the convention was coming to order they were determined to have an orderly election rev c v johnson illinois state president and one of the national convention vice presidents was selected to conduct the election the election results were not surprising there were votes for taylor and for jackson the convention now had two presidents when the time for the evening session approached jackson entered the hall to preside taylor was standing beside him the police were called neither side would yield when the police inspector remarked that the situation was embarrassing to him one of the delegates yelled up to him if you had stayed out of here you wouldnt be embarrassed were baptists and we have a right to fight among ourselves without your help in spite of this brief moment of humor which was appreciated by both sides the wounds in the ranks of the negro baptists probed deep into the heart of its church the year found two men claiming the presidency the conclusion with elements of tragedy was consummated in kansas city kansas the next year the convention was called to order by dr jackson the taylor team had decided to fight through another medium the courts however the taylor contingent could not contain its anger while jackson was presiding disorder broke out it began when dr e c estell of dallas texas presented a resolution requesting jackson to allow his name to be voted on again as president of the convention stomping and yelling the taylor forces became so disorderly that the director of the auditorium begged the mayor of the city to appeal to the convention i am ashamed the mayor stated to know that you call yourselves christians you are bringing disgrace upon your city and upon your race the taylor forces went to court it was their intent to have a courtordered election with court supervision the court obliged it ordered that all delegates who had registered with both sides be recognized it ordered that dr d a holmes of kansas city supervise the election both sides agreed the orderly election that followed lasted until the early hours of the morning the final results were jackson votes and taylor the fire that burned in the convention had upset the church world the memory of the bitter struggle will never be forgotten in spite of the customary congratulations of the vanquished to the victor the ranks have never been closed the cuts were too deep negro baptists have formed a new convention and have discovered that the power struggle has caused irreputable harm in the meantime joseph harrison jackson stands at the helm of the majority without the obstacle of tenure which has never been reintroduced it is now predicted that he will remain there for life his enemies bitterly recall his concluding sentences in his controversial american struggle in the american way as christians we must accept and employ those methods that are just seasoned in love and based on the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of god the church cannot be used as a rubber stamp for every method employed in the name of democracy and freedom the church must not wait for others to begin a movement for human betterment the church is a revolutionary movement and gods prophets and gods ministers have historically been those who have come to turn the world upside down true his critics respond however even those words were directed against the militancy of the negroes who march toward freedom thus this nation has witnessed the dramatic performances of two men who in ordinary times would have made their marks in history without debatejackson with his ideas on production and king with his emphasis on creative protest however neither man lives in ordinary timesnor are they ordinary men their feud continues both in chicago and in the minds of negroes who have been further torn asunder by the new cry of black_power it remains for history to reveal which man and what instrument finally delivers the negro one thing is certain if the entire civil_rights movement could be cast as a play and produced in a theater that contained todays negroes both men would be standing in the wings to receive their accolades martin_luther_king jr without a doubt would receive a standing ovation joseph harrison jackson if granted one curtain call for his performance would undoubtedly bow to applause however feeble it is consistent with the i f colonial mindset to experiment on and tinker with the lives and fortunes of those who serve as the exploited when a fire breaks out and the house is burning down only the colonial mind could recommend the placing of whatever firefighting resources as are available on one corner of the back wall in order that we can learn to do at least one portion of the task as well as we possibly can yet such is the spirit of approaches to the massive needs of the urban poor through the sustained device of minuscule pilot projects in education and in employment it is consistent with a colonial mind which would build sustained weakness into urban life to launch a massive head start program for children when these same children must live in homes where fathers are not first equipped to provide the means of livelihood urban problems are rooted in the adult environment and not in the environment of children the experience of the best efforts at the reclamation of children has been that after a few months of academic success the weight of limitations of home life has placed the largest numbers back where they were but with the ingredient of added frustration churches which approach the problems of city life with programs for children do not get at the heart of the urban condition they waste money kill valuable time and come through in the long run as an affrontery to our urban minorities who while accepting often the proffered largesse perceive that the churches think of their needs in terms of the needs of children our churches have far too long shared in and augmented the colonialist mind which has spent and desecrated the resources of our cities our churches have failed to develop programs which build in the power and substantial interchange needed for urban rebuilding like colonialists generally they have perceived of their own kind as privileged they have seen the white clergy as fit to minister to urban minorities but have not built an equitable twoway street for the professionals of minorities to minister to those of the white sub urban majority the negro clergy long have chafed under a system of rank colonialism which sees the unspoken power of white people limit them to less than what their creator intended them in immediate terms to be one overriding fact should be clear we cannot be change agents unless we are willing to be changed ourselves what can our churches do to effect some measure of substantial regeneration in the life of our cities they may begin to recognize the unconscious burdens and predispositions of a colonial mindset which they bring to the concerns of urban life white people do not necessarily consciously seek to limit the lives of negroes yet the clear facts are that the force of their efforts in urban problem areas has been such that with increased interest the intensity of the problems of the black urban masses has increased for example housing and school segregation in the north has increased the dollar income gap between negroes and whites has increased school failures have spiralled negro males have progressively faired worse in relation both to white males and negro and white females thus placing greater strains upon negro family life the growing restlessness in our slums attests to the fact that things are acutely felt to be getting worse rather than better an america which sees the negro in terms of exploitation unconsciously exploits racism and exploitation of those who happen to be at the bottom of the social and economic pyramid are parts of our cultural pattern we are born into our colonialistminded culture and only as we are aware of its power and place in our lives can we become freer agents within our cultural setting this is an education task of major proportions to be undertaken within the white community itself we can recognize the need for power for selfdirected selfdevelopment on the part of those who inhabit our cities resources for urban rebuilding from without are wasted unless those who reside in our cities first are empowered for selfperpetuating improvement in the affairs of city life facilitation must therefore be given to the fullest development and expression of the latent power of the black urban masses bishop john bright of the african methodist episcopal church writes all of us know so well that power is merely to do things to move things to control things to direct to create to destroy the desire of negro america to get black_power is not to destroy america but to do great things for america to move america forward yes to control part of america like all other ethnic groups to help direct the affairs of america to be creative american citizens yes to destroy the bigots the social ills political ills the economic ills racial ills and to drive them from the shores of america our churches may work to encourage black pride black solidarity and promote a sense of the importance of the investment of black people in america white americans have worked to weaken the negro and to destroy his sense of worth if our cities are to be renewed programs in housing education employment and black solidarity need to be aggressively fostered some such programs are discussed in my black_power and urban unrest hawthorn books inc new york we can create mechanisms for authentic communication this is a basic and continuing need for all aspects of our national and globallife the development and refinement of such devices may well represent the greatest contribution to the common good which our generation may devise our churches can begin in this direction in such efforts on the urban scene we may focus upon the adult environment of our inner cities as representing the area of greatest need new vehicles for continuing openended adult education and retraining are needed throughout our society collegiatetype communityoriented educational reclamation and fulfillment institutions should be developed in a massive way and located foremost in the heart of every major negro community in america i have detailed elsewhere the broad implications of such an enterprise for many segments of the nations life this should represent the coming major educational thrust in america our churches may take a lead in seeing that this is done either those who reside in our urban slums are reclaimed and rehabilitated in terms of life and livelihood pursuits or they become an increasingly heavy deadweight to retard the forward development of our cities we must recognize that massive problems call for solutions of appropriate proportions our churches should work together wherever this is possible but the timidity colonialism or lack of vision of one or more denominations should not restrict the ready enterprise of others we must be open to change we must listen to negroes and accept their formal leadership not only in the vital area of urban affairs to which they hold the key but also in every other area of our common life our cities are in peril material resources of such massive proportions as suggested by the senate hearings on urban blight undoubtedly are greatly needed but alone such resources will not suffice the key element in urban regeneration is the human element as represented by the black urban masses their exploitationboth conscious and unconsciousmust cease at no place than in the life of our cities is the scriptural admonition more appropriate that he who would save his life must lose it only under such circumstances of clear and determined commitments in word and deed to human growth and fulfillment may there be any hope of enduringly effective urban evangelism once our unconscious and pervasive colonial mindset in regard to city life is cast aside the urban condition of increasingly ominous blight may be changed to that of largely selfdirected growth for good ver since black e t a m ericansforefap thers were technically freed from slavery there has existed a conflict as how best to come to terms with this whitedominated society stripped to its essentials the conflict has been between those who propose integration and those who propose ethnocentrism as a solution now for other minority groups these two solutions have not been incompatible america after all is a pluralist society and a study of the history of those minorities ie irish italian and jewish who have made it clearly indicates that the growth of ethnic separatism is a precondition for eventual penetration into ruling circles and full economic integration theoretically then there is no good reason why most black americans should not be able to live simultaneouslyas most white americans doin two worlds one integrated and the other for the most part separated however in practice the black man has not been able to live in the best of the two worlds and the main reason that this conflict this unnatural division in our ranksis still with us is that white people through their institutions labor unions foundations the press local and federal governments etc have taken sides with the integrationists discrediting black ethnocentrism they have shoved forward the integrationists as the responsible black leaders mesmerized by white acceptance and ignoring history the integrationists have failed to see the need to develop their own communities as a base of power they have urged black people to submerge their unorganized numbers in coalitions dominated by other organized groups and they have urged black people to disperse themselves in white communities not realizing that a people have to know who we is before they can start effectively dealing with them and they they have not realized that first you consolidate then you integrate until recently the ethnocen trists organizations have not been able to compete on an equal basis with the integrationists organizations unable to get money and acceptance from white institutions ironically the ethnocentrists have been unable to attract those black people with the skills necessary to carry out their programs while generally the ethnocentrists organizations have been wellmeaning for instance the muslims they have most often been simply ineffective thus instead of having two equals complementing each other an imbalance has occurred however with the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc and the congress of racial equality core embracing black_powera more poetic way of saying ethnocentrismthe necessary balance is being created that is why their presence on the scene is such a healthy sign it is one thing for the naacp to pit itself against the muslims and yet another thing for it to pit itself against core core like sncc has left the civil_rights movement to join the negro movement the volatile sncc with its charismatic stokely carmichael the pragmatic core with its phlegmatic floyd mckissick while core no longer has the white beatnik image it had during the early sixties it is still in a period of transition there is about it that mixture of audacity and ambivalence which accompanies each whats a black revolution why simply stated it means a renaissance a new awakening of the black conscience its black_power the securing of the necessary power to change our lives and to decide what we want for ourselves the black revolution is a force for good a force for change the black revolution has six goals economic power more and better jobs an improved selfimage for the black man development of a militant intelligent educated and dedicated leadership political power enforcement of federal laws that protect the rights of all men and abolition of those laws that are used to punish people because they are black consumer power the development of a black consumer block to be used against those commercial forces who fail to recognize black people employ them and fail to give them franchise core has members in chapters scattered all over the country it is ruled by the national convention which meets annually and is composed of representatives from the various local chapters virtually autonomous the local chapters form cores real strength and give it the flexibility that a national organization needs for although black people form a distinct group in this country with similar problems housing education employment police brutality lack of capital etc the intensity and refinement of these problems vary from one part of the country to another in harlem one of the problems is that black people do not really own any property residential or business but this might not be true of black people in atlanta or chicago also black people in one region of the country might be further along in their development obviously the southern black man has a keener sense of community and is less apathetic than the northern black man additionally in one city it might be feasible for black people to ally themselves with democrats in another it might be in their best interest to side with republicans and in another it might be best to act independent of either party by virtue of its independence each local chapter is able to decide which problems will be attacked first of course having autonomous local chapters can also create difficulties for it places a strain on the national office in terms of overall strategy and programs this means that the national director must have that special quality of being able to follow and lead at the same time mckissicks whole life seems to have been a preparation for this job mckissick was influenced by two ministers one a methodist the other a baptistboth were my grandfathers he smiles both were great talkers and i used to listen to them they talked about things like the inalienable rights of men and mans right to be free subjects like that from listening to them i began to develop my own philosophy and there was also the inner security that comes from parents love his father a jack of all trades worked at such jobs as bellhop and waiter before becoming an insurance salesman his mother worked as a cashier for him to have become a school teacher would no doubt have utterly pleased them both during world war ii he married and served in europe as a technical sergeant after the war he returned to the campus to complete his education he attended morehouse college where he met martin l king jr got to know whitney young then at atlanta university and the legendary sugarfoot the boston celtics sam jones when both attended north carolina college he joined his first protest group during this period the fellowship of reconciliation a group to which bayard rustin also belonged his apprenticeship included participation in numerous sitins picket lines and other demonstrations long before they became camp mckissick also joined the naacp and served as the north carolina youth director in mckissick achieved national recognition by becoming the first black student to graduate from the university of north carolina law school if the harassment he underwent at the university of north carolina dead frogs in his room water in his locker and a live snake in his bed was not a matter of public record one could imagine him going to law school simply to save money from lawyers fees for his whole family has been in jail and his childrenjoycelyn andree floyd jr and charmainwere the first black children to attend white elementary junior high and high school in durham n c in fact the mckissick family is almost totally involved in the movement a conversation that begins with mckissick at the office may be completed at the dinner table where the family has gathered the mckissick family lives uptown harlem in a home that is comfortable without being pretentious guests are entertained downstairs in an elongated room whose one excess is the huge mahogany desk from behind which mckissick presides directly behind the desk looms a fireplace to the left a bookcase and to the right a banner with large bold letters proclaiming black_power one evening simply by chance a rare occurrence movement peopie letting their hair down and talking about the movement as if an outsider was not present we had come to dinner with bob gore and later found ourselves with ruth turner and mckissicks eldest daughter joycelyn bob bought a fifth of bourbon mckissick acted as the disc jockey and played his favorite s bessie smith jimmy reed tampa red lightnin hopkins leadbelly lulu reed slowly names of towns like danville wilmington and charlotte and names of people like bo johnson williams johnny and spike filled the room grim southern apparitions emerging from the past who seemed so at home in harlem oh daddy you remember spike remember he was the one who always wanted to be first in line remember hey floyd man how about that time in danville remember what that cracker sheriff said boy that sure was a mean cracker yeah and johnny you remember johnny he used to sing all the time what ever happened to him johnny johnny simpson yea thats him what ever happened to him i dont know you know he was never the same after they whipped him that last time never the same ill never forget the way he looked when he first came out of the hospital but in a way i guess he was lucky remember what they did to bo when the evening is finished the outsider is filled with so many questions what manner of men are these movement people outnumbered by their opposition and all but unknown by the very people for whom they fight what inner force sustains them but when the evening ends there is a sense of relief too around true believers there is not much comfort for the outsider besides there is something disquieting in being confronted with the knowledge that your people are in a real war with real blood being spilled and you have been but a spectator days later back at the national office mckissick who travels a lot and often works late in the night nods until there is talk of black_power and its effects upon core then his dark eyes become alert and his mind alive he discusses the new core black people began to control core in prior to that the national board was predominantly white now only one white person serves on the board so in a sense core has been moving towards black_power for some time causing many whites to leave the organization however they are being quickly replaced by black people who are attracted to core because of its black_power stance and cores membership is actually increasing but with core fast becoming a black organization a money problem has been created the various foundations as they have done so often in the past have again taken sides they give their money to the urban league and the naacp in terms of program black_power has forced core to gravitate towards those with the greatest needs the black poor core has become involved in programs like the grand marie project in louisiana a sweet potato cooperative and has helped to elect several black people to political office in louisiana mississippi and georgia in baltimore there is the quite successful target city project a program geared to organize black people into effective economic and political power blocs demonstrations are no longer the only weapon used by core and while cores basic philosophy has not changed it is aimed more directly toward aiding and involving black people of course the slogan black_power does raise some larger questions of tactics and timing there is such a thing as italian power jewish power irish power anglosaxon protestant power etc and that it is not perpetuated by chance nor specifically ordained by god on a national level anglosaxon protestants control the military communications media political and bankingindustrial institutions further in new york city the jews control education the italians control construction and the irish control the police between them the jews and italians split the clothing industry night clubs and entertainment and the rackets therefore there also is a need for black people to have power but while one can agree with the concept of black_power one can still question the slogan black_power itself other groups do not talk about their power they practice it once a group really has power there is little need to refer to it by its brand name nor is it good tactics to tell your plans to your opponent and sometimes to tell the truth is poor politics mckissick argues that black_power is like a slogan that sells a product and that black_power is meant to be a dialogue between black people but is it really selling the product and how would it have been if the slogan black_power had been allowed to develop in the black community like the word soul the same general arguments used against black_power can be used against soul it is racist it does more harm than good since you always have to explain and define it it isolates black people from the mainstream etc ad nauseum however the term soul was allowed to develop in the black community black people did not first learn about it on tv or read it in the papers it was theirs for years before whites were aware of it time however might work in favor of the term black_power for black_power implies an awareness that other groups have power and in this sense it is a realistic appraisal of components of the power structure america has a great capacity for absorption and soon black_power will join other poetic expressions soulful groovey hip funky square swinging etc that blacks have coined and contributed to the language already there is talk of green power mckissick is aware of all this he realizes that one can be used on television while attempting to use it and already he speaks of limiting his television appearances organizing the black community will be tedious and unglamourous and there are no short cuts for the hard work involved when asked the direction that core will take in the future he cited the six goals of the black revolution refusing to be more specific he smiled and said its time for a lot of moving without saying too much it is as if he has felt the times pulse for the movement has had its verbal orgies the time for shouting deprecations against the white man has come and gone now is the time for getting together quietly and doing what must be done without a doubt there does exist among us a generation of black people who exude an ineffable air of selfappreciation black consciousness ethnocentrism nationalism negritudeby whatever name it exists whether labeled or not cores ability to significantly involve this group will be one of its major tests for it is a lonely restless generation of nonbelievers looking for a new faith a generation compelled to act even though dramas have not yet been written for it however if core is to survive and remain true to the tenets of black_power it must be financed by black people most of the money must come from the black middle class and this will be cores other major test as long as core was a civil_rights organization money was not the real problem but as we mentioned above cores stance on black_power has alienated a sizable number of white people and while its membership has actually increased its dollar intake has decreased thus core is faced with the complicated task of drawing upon two distinct groups for its support the one militant but undisciplined the other financially stable but politically conservative and acquisitive never having demonstrated in its entire history any interest in supporting black institutions it will be a tough row to hoe if core favors the militants it risks losing the conservatives and hence its financial support if it favors the conservatives it risks losing the militants and its position in the avantgarde additionally there is the opposition that will come from the white community and the integrationists who will be vying with core for the support of the black masses but floyd mckissick seems the man for the job since he has become national director he has shifted the direction of core as well as its location and when mckissick speaks of a black revolution and says that the civil_rights movement is deader than a door knob we know he exaggerates not from arrogance but to make us begin thinking of ourselves not as we are but as we can be home black inlectuals the gen eration is changing come home black intellectuals the white mans conditioning of black minds is cracking at the seams come home black intellectuals recondition the young to drive for maximum effort in the development of their minds come home black intellectuals and help reeducate and reorient your people come home black intellectuals before you are relegated to that sterile eternity the historical footnote the generation is changing and the negro intellectual who in many instances seems a pale copy of his white counterpart can no longer play at being white by imitating the white mans culture in every way which is often so alien to the negro mind the negro intellectual who should be the leader among his people must turn within and seek those positive and constructive things about himself and his people and build his and his own peoplesself respect for the newlyawakened generation does not accept many of the standards of the white culture as being the only good and right patterns of human behavior the newlyawakened black generation is bent on establishing itself as a vital and moving force in american society not under the enlightened leadership of whites or under the leadership of puppet negro leaders who dance at the ends of oligarchic strings which control them the conditioning of the negro mind has for over years deprived him of his manhood and individuality but with each succeeding generation the degree of conditioning has lessened moreover the authoritarian personality structure of the american white male and the negro female which has in the past operated to reinforce and sustain submission is on the wane traditionally these personality structures only allowed for the most part the more conservative negro leadership however with the young negro generation of today this kind of leadership will not be tolerated for it has cast aside the humble withdrawn role of the negro for the role of a man in his own right many of the rearguard conservative negro intellectuals today comprise much of the negro middle class which generally has tried to remove itself from the negro masses as a consequence of this selfimposed removal the demand for leadership among negroes for negroes has brought forth a group of leaders of a less welleducated and less sophisticated character such a development cannot just be said to be bad for the negro but tragic it would seem that the negro intellectuals duty is to do some deep soulsearching and to remove himself from his comfortable middleclass niche and render unto his people for the present generation of negroes and those to come will be less conditioned to a white standard of beauty to a white standard of good and bad to a white standard of culture where these standards find their authority for action based on a whitedefined christian religion which identifies white as purity and good black as base and foul the negro intellectual must be reminded that among the young negro females it is no longer a point of pride to have a white mans child or one as mixed and nearwhite as possible they have realized that to desire such a thing is an admission of selfimposed inferiority and leads to degrees of selfhate the negro intellectual must be reminded that he has indeed been out of contact with niggertown desperately running from the black culture that gave him life the negro intellectual must be reminded that only the strong have endured from his african parentage that the conditions under which his forebears endured did not permit the weak to survive the negro intellectual must be reminded that though the traditional conditioning and brain washing practices of the white majority have been formidable they could little have changed nor reversed the process of nature once set in motion short of complete extermination of the negro in this country finally the negro intellectual must be reminded that if he does not recognize these practices and processes and reassume leadership his leadership will become something out of time and date negro intellectuals have for years stepped around the problem of the mothercentered organization of many lower class negro families in a culture which sustains a fathercentered system negro intellectuals have failed their people relative to the disadvantageous position of the negro male as family man the fact that divorce laws may be just in a white culture does not make them just for negroes when family organization among many negroes is the reverse of that of most whites especially when the negro males ability to exploit opportunities in the job market is not equal even to that of many negro females and the sad part of this entire pattern has been the negro intellectuals refusal to point out to both the negro and to whites that the negro females improved opportunities have existed alone because of the white mans peculiar relationship to her but the nonintellectual black male recognizing this problem on his own level has dealt with it in a crude destructive but effective manner witness the high divorce rate among negroes witness the degree of welfare support to fatherless families witness the high degree of illegitimacy witness the gross disrespect for females by many males of the lower class the negro intellectual must be reminded that this is perhaps the first generation in which the negro male is bent on assuming his posture as a man and that the nature of the family unit may well be the cause of the new rationale he is well aware of his proscribed position in american society he sees christian society operated seemingly alone for white people he has witnessed numbers of his women sell out their own people at the expense of the negro males selfimage he realizes he must defend a country that seemingly still is bent upon using his black back as a work horse and he is aware of the fact that the white man fears the black males acquisition of power because of the degraded place assigned to black males throughout american history finally he is aware of the fact that the white man has sold himself a sense of superiority which when lost causes great mental difficulty for him small wonder that the young negro generation seems committed to either complete emancipation or destruction negro intellectuals should not forget that it is they who have helped to reinforce the opinion that there is nothing worse than an educated fool they should not forget that it is they who have allowed the attitude that motherwit and common sense are to be valued over trained intellect and competency in trade or professsion they should be reminded that the young generation is little interested in turning the other cheek or mumbling prayers to heaven for deliverance but is belching expletives and bent on their own selfdeliverance by whatever means are possible come home black intellectuals for the brutal fact of life in this midtwentieth century is that the world today is a world given over to racism it does not matter practically speaking whethor not it is right or wrong it does not matter practically speaking if it is against the laws of god it does not matter practically speaking if there are mountains of evidence that there are no great differences in the native potentials of the three major divisions of human stock come home black intellectuals for what does matter in the here and now is that racism is on the ascendency racism is like a religion a belief this is a fact of life which the american negro is going to have to learn to live with moreover it is not likely that racism will be eradicated from the minds of men in the next few decades or tens of decades for that matter come home black intellectuals and help your people seek out their strong points and build a reservoir of pride and self respect come home black intellectuals and be examples for the negros survival in the age of automation may rest on nothing less than allaround superior performance come home black intellectuals ralph waldo el lison a psychologically sound type of the literarywise who soar but seldom roam holds that there is an argument in progress between black men and white men as to the true nature of american reality indeed neither literary overseers academic elihus nor ethopiam eunuchsall of whom now circulate freely through establishment platforms have known quite what to make of invisible man mainly because the narratorprotagonist who sets the course of this achievement in fictional variety and verisimilitude is still in the making for whatever its shortcomings ellisons creation is as omificent as anything the modern american novel has produced it is one thing moreover for those presuming to pit life against death to lie down in freudian darkness and set up in glib print it is quite another duly to observe and yet dwell apart from cesspoolbased geysers of pathological obsessions and mock dialogues for ellison and for a good halfdozen other natural sons who happen at once to be novelists and american negroesand even this latter by fiat of the pathology of syncrisisthe essential reality of the human condition reaches beyond the version of those david daiches see his english literature has justly appraised as fools and freaks hence if through the process that the american novel in the main has become it has degenerated into an imageblurring mirror of nihilistic negations or the american stage excepting arthur miller and the late lorraine hansberry into a reptile house of sickness and shrieking projections the condition can hardly be charged against the negro novelist in his right state beginning at the same scripture he is philip reading nor can the noble tradition of folk simplicity and assertive dignity from which those of trombone timbre as distinguished from that of tamborine neuroses yet draw be done to death the test of a living literature is surely not how often or widely an establishmentlaunched name is dropped orbited and echoed by jamesian scribes but whether its character creations walk in the light of our time for all time and for any fruitful purpose it may well be as chairman of the bookofthemonth club harry sherman contends that the judges of the y earoldcorporatepatrondistributor consider themselves truly representative of the general public and not apprehensive of the possible unpopularity the presumed unacceptability of any book it may even be that they have read themselves into the state of blessedness which he claims for them and drawn their many millions of the top layers on the qui vive intellectually unto them this much they have proved on the merit of invisible man and on the canon of diverse quality novels which during the sleepy fifties confirmed the arrival in american letters of a big four among negro novelists they were either insensitive or silent the intense and naturally balanced interplay of comic touch and tragic reality evident in the best of chester himes cast the first stone and the third generation in ann petrys wise and comprehensive treatment of tragic love cutting across lines of class and race to be climaxed by a clash of pride the narrows and in those euripidean pillars of the unshakable wright foundation the outsider and the long dream cannot be honestly bypassed nor can such a supporting cast of fleshed and spirited images read into the record through mark kennedys the pecking order john oliver killens youngblood and julian mayfields the hit these novels simply cannot be disposed of by packaging them in superficial surveys warmed over after serving their original purpose as exercises in ph d dissertation writing the logical fruit of this routine mistreatment of some of the most penetrating and permanent writing of the decade immediately behind us is threefold having been led away from it the american clerisy was left without lenses to see the blood on the moon that was to stream down into the streets granted that the relationship between huck finn and nigger jim like that between wolsey and cromwell in shakespeare is a sympathetic portrait and cherished memory but far more lovely and meaningful is that between link williams and camilla treadway sheffield in ann petrys remarkable reworking of the theme central to romeo and juliet and cyrano de bergerac yet it has never occurred to american critics to recognize miss petrys vision as independent of their guidance and control and wherever the negro artist has indicated his unwillingness to serve and preserve their psychological and economic comfort he has been read out of circulation he may of course share fully in their pathological distresses but a seat among the outpatients of the henry james institute of hidden meanings is not to be equated with a place of reasonable comfort next door in fair housing philip the reader moreover is not for bending double in compromise alienation or dense actuality the real contradictions of a life he elects to face are sufficient for his purposes and bearing their reality with their revelations negroes have always lived close enough to privilege to work fight and die in the service of owners or overseers the question now a positive answer to which would certainly clarify if not settle the matter at issue in the human rights revolution on the home front is put from a rooftop response two thousand years after peter by b j the little demon leader in the pecking order anybody kin work fer white folks its livin with um that counts hence if the criticsclerisy eyes be closed arrogant or evil in the reading of literature by negro americans how shall human understanding hearts and houses be opened how else can the american credo be fulfilled or american literature and art be free henry fielding declared himself out not to make bad men good but to make good men wise the stray fruit of criticsclerisy rejection of the negro in literary life reality is expatriation half of americas talented native sons who seek life in creative expression are currently living and dying in old and alien lands himes and mayfield are overseas and death came to wright and willard motley in france and mexico respectively even from these outposts however leopold senghors recent defense and definition of their mission and their poetry the defense and illustration of negritude has held true for it is a gusher that does not run dry a basic significant element of the civilization of the universal which is being constructed before our eyes by us and for us by all and for all a classic example of this is a singularly significant redwood among the tall timbers of american reality fiction the long dream that has been both mistaken and maligned it is nevertheless the essential key to an understanding of two continuously troublesome problems in the coarse texture and strangled style of ghetto existence negro family life and the negros relationship to the law and given the living holocaust in natchez mississippi as of april which furnished the springboard substance and framework of this misread and bypassed novel no meaningful commentary reportorial or testimonial about root causes of the crises in either our cities or our families can fail to reckon with the disturbing truth it reveals but the sustained irony of the long dream is that its portrait of integrated roguery in blackandwhite has leaped from its pages into the streets and courts of our big cities and naturally beyond the projects of an academic bourgeoise of intellectual posture psychsociological bent and hustling ambition the strange fruit of critics clerisy rejection of lifesize negroes in literature is the kind of marketplace the situation has produced shored up by public ignorance apathy and fear in negrowhite relationships in america a cynical and telepathetic alliance links the widely advertised moynihan report journalist theodore h whites pontifical essays on negroes and hollywoods subtly altered version of the late edward lewis wallants the pawnbroker which went to the moviegoing public with black brock peters in the criminal overlord role the novelist assigned to a sicilian one need only set the above three in juxtaposition to the case of william manchester who wrote about a wealthy and important family and an issue of highest importance to see the helplessness of a people without due recognition in life literature and law a public informed by the best that is in negro literature could not be so misled what the literature of america by its natural sons needs perhaps is a disinterested appraisal such as a david daiches or dennis brogan would be capable of providing the dilemma in american life was not ably diagnosed until gunnar myrdal pulled together what really mattered and wrote a commentary that made sense if it did not make converts to be sure maxwell geismar and lewis mumford have since the sixties begun to challenge the current chaos to return to reality and order or john steinbeck at stockholm delivered the address for our health and recovery but these voices are likewise an overlooked minority one rather significant multiple offense by other house members has been overlooked during efforts to disqualify a colleague adam clayton powell for defiance of the courts no one even tried to reprimand the representatives who with senators had signed the march southern manifesto that document defied the supreme courts unanimous school segregation decision and initiated a sweeping campaign to dignify defiance of the federal judiciary that has left a bitter heritage its signers were seated without question just a decade ago a moderate education editor recently reported that the nations schools are more separate and less equal than they were years ago last may commissioner of education harold howe ii is second only to representative powell as a target of congressional wrath as he steers an uncertain course in enforcing the civil_rights act the southern manifesto itself is fast fading from memory but its effect in inciting disobedience to law lives on when we call on southern officials for compliance they just laugh at us one federal aide is reported to have said in the aftermath of the civil war there had been a precarious balance between bitterness and submission on the part of the white south as eric mckitrick has said carl schurz an officially commissioned observer whose report was ignored ruefully concluded that the opportunity had been lost as soon as president andrew johnson permitted it to be understood that he purposed to restore those states to their selfgoverning functions without preparation the stillexisting proslavery spirit was naturally flushed with new hope the precarious balance reappeared after the school segregation decision senator russell long said at first although i completely disagree with the decision my oath of office requires me to accept it as law the border states prepared to obey the law such groups as the southern regional council called for action by community leaders to prepare for compliance former virginia senator benjamin muse reported desegregation might have been accomplised in many localities before resistance had hardened and it might have forestalled some organized harassment all such hopes were dashed when the southern declaration of constitutional principles was released the apostles of bitterness had overwhelmed the forces that were organizing to encourage respect for law calling the supreme courts decision an abuse of judicial power the congressional signers of the manifesto pledged an unremitting fight against the ruling while the document cautioned against disorder and lawless acts its true meaning was as anthony lewis wrote to make defiance of the supreme court and the constitution socially acceptable in the southto give resistance to the law the approval of the southern establishment the effect on the constitutional rights of millions of our children has been incalculable few in congress gave the manifesto the name it deserved senator clifford case deplored its tendency to incite resistance and oregons richard neuberger declared it underminded the rule of law senator humphrey feared that persistence in denial of equal rights would arouse world indignation but according to william s white disclaimed any intention to admonish his southern friends it remained for salty old pat macnamara to stand up and say this declaration may not be outright sedition but it certainly is subversive in its intent to undermine the integrity of the judicial system of this nation the new house includes of the representatives who signed the manifesto they are hardly fit to help determine if cavalier contempt for the law is enough to warrant exclusion of an elected member several years ago as a negro living in the south i had feelings of grandeur about what the north was like i had been told that it was truly the land of opportunity freedom and wholesome living with those preconceived notions i came north to explore this earthly heaven for myself i have been here five years have watched with great concern and objectivity the conditions have been involved first hand in the social movements and now i have made a decision about where i want to spend the remainder of my life that decision is in the south there are definite reasons why to be very honest i do believe the north offers greater opportunities and more freedom than the south but all this seems to be misinterpreted by my negro brother the negro in the north seems to view all of this as an achievement end rather than an achieving means since most northern negroes have come from the south by comparison they naturally see the north as superior this seems to create a feeling of having it made the result is appalling apathy negro communities in the north that could be operating at and per cent efficiency are operating at and per cent efficiency because so few really sense the need yet in the south there are negro communities operating at and per cent efficiency while their size structure and pressure would seem to indicate a much smaller percentage the negro in the south knows what has to be done he knows what he has to do he knows that he cannot afford to put his hand to the plow and look back so he keeps plowing what should be of paramount concern to all of us is the kind of future we can look forward to frankly unless things change i have grave skepticism about the future of the negro in the north this is primarily because of his apathy at best the situation now is critical the schools are overcrowded in many systems there are double shifts and there are teenage gangs and more gangs what really disturbs me is that there does not appear to be any cure in sight much of this is brought about because enough interest and concern cannot be generated to pass bond referendums to finance new schools as is the procedure in the midwestern metropolis in which i now live then too many school districts overlap thereby making enemies of property owners against bond referendums because they see the measures as a continuing process and continuing expense about the gangs i wish i could say a good word but one would be hard to find knifings shootings and killings are constantly occuring and all of this is on the increase the gangs are well organized and there are ranks for all members it has been reported that one of the best ways to move up is by inflicting injury and in some cases murder the gangs have just about taken over in the north based upon the pace they are now setting five years will find the north an unsafe place to walk the streets under these conditions i would not be giving my children a fair chance for wholesome survival if i stayed in the north i know the south has its segregated schools but that system is breaking and my knowledge of the south tells me that the break will be solid here again overcrowdedness is not a major problem in the public schools of the south because schools are built with state funds whenever the need arises i know there are gangs in the south but they dont exist to inflict injury and murder is virtually unheard of among teenagers there i also believe a greater sense of value is placed upon human life by negroes in the south this is definitely lacking in the north and perhaps explains why the teenage gangs in the north are so violent more important i believe the negro in the south has a better sense of direction than the negro in the north primarily because he sees the south as a challenge to his ends therefore there is a greater spirit of togetherness it has been said that the most important gift one can have is a sense of perspective and duty im going back to the south because i want to keep that gift what power is there in christianity to wean men from race prejudice wrote kelly miller the howard university sociologist early in this century in mandate for white christians john knox press kyle haselden returns to this question which whether asked in simplicity or irony has lost none of its impact for many of those most passionately concerned with combating racial injustice christianity has become a handy synonym for hypocrisy it would be sad if this attitude lost mr haselden some readers among people who would appreciate him most a pastor for many years and currently editor of the christian century and the pulpit he is a serious christian a man who does not shirk the moral implications of his religion or deny that it has been distorted by the uses to which its professors put it christian religious practice has always been a mirror of events never a touchstone of rectitude historians and sociologists can find a key to the special hypocrisies of a period by taking a careful look at what the churches have not stressed the mandate presented to white christians in america troubled as they must be by the failure of their churches as a whole to take a stand on the moral issues of race relations is simple mr haselden recommends christian love in six coherently expressed chapters he presents a remarkably balanced analysis of the complexity of the religious attitudes of white christians the overt bigotry of some christians is not denied but the author is more concerned with guilt by dissociation from the moral issues of racial injustice he writes of the element of coercion in martin_luther_king jrs policy of nonviolence and believes that this coercive element the technique of shaming ones adversary by love is the one that will eventually be effective not surprisingly dr_king has written an appreciative foreword christian love says mr haselden knows no limit in its pursuit of justice he quotes pascalbecause men do not fortify justice they justify forceto bring home the consequences of a failure of this love one such consequence being the practice of scapegoating the temptation to make whipping boys out of symbolic figures like george wallace bull connor and benjamin willis does not absolve those of us whose crimes are less obvious christian love says mr haselden whose intellectual brilliance lights up some carefully shaded recesses of our consciences does not rejoice in the evil that it discovers in men but guilt does there is no way for a white christian to avoid the burden of personal responsibility for the failure of his church or the compromises of his own science mandate for white christians faces the facts but does not in turn fall into the trap of making a scapegoat of the church a white christian need not look beyond the basic tenets of his faith to find a solution to the problem of how to live with his black brother mr haseldens book honest thoughtful and unemotional may help negroes to understand the apparent ambiguity of the white mans attitudes towards them as well as doing something to modify those attitudes in the light of rationality and love evening lay in figueroa street with the sky purpling overhead ernie and i walked along saying little and watching the cars and the street we passed a tuxedo shop the lights in the back off and a dummy in the display window wore an after five jacket that i couldnt afford we turned at the corner into a liquor store coolness was inside and the room was well lighted two men stood

behind us you want to try it boy he said im goin ta call the police the black man said moving away from the counter and edging toward the back a man in grey denims stepped up and stood beside ernie and me i saw what happened saul he said to the bald man you provoked these hare boys the white man lowered the gun and pointed his finger at the new mans very dark face wait a minute johnson now johnson this aint none of your business the negro clerk said looking afraid to go in back now or to use the telephone on the counter johnson didnt seem to hear them but turned to ernie and me why dont you fellahs go someplace else this mans gonna put ya in trouble he said indicating the bald man with a nod with his free hand on the cash register and the other dropped below the counter clutching the pistol the fat man stood as far away from the counter as possible he and the negro almost huddled in the same spot you better get rid of that there gun the black man in denims told him the bald man removed his hand from the cash register and then showed his now empty handjohnson you been a customer of mine for over ten years and if you really seen what had gone on you wouldnt be stickin your nose in here these boys are probably gettin ready to rob me sonna ernie tried to get past johnson but johnson blocked him from touching the counter and i held his arms take yo finger out of my face johnson said when the bald man lifted his hand to shield himself now johnson the negro clerk began shut up you hear me talkin to yo boss i pulled ernies sleeve and we both turned silently and walked out the door pushing the crowd in front but ernie screamed one last remark over his shoulder from inside the store the last thing i heard was the storekeeper asking johnson why johnson could call us boys and he couldnt jfc d around two as we passed the liquor store we paused at the corner for the light we watched the girl in pink capris drinking a red soda she and the bald man leaned at the far end of the counter next to the window her pink tongue played in the bottle opening spitting air into the container and plugging the liquid in the end then she would jerk the bottle down swishing the last of the beverage around in the bottom though leaving her tongue tip out pointing redly and moist at the store owner he leaned over the counter the neon coke signs flashing upon his forehead in the store the other clerk closed and locked doors and emptied trash and swept the floor alxander held the n big box carefully in his hand the subway trin win in s way towards the brooklyn bridge he tried to control the twitching of his left arm he couldnt oh god he said softly to himself if i drop it now but he couldnt think of this no he would have to force himself to forget this box and the jarring jerking movements of the train and too he would have to forget that he was alone and would be even more so after he got to the bridge if only some of the others had come with him but no they wouldnt maybe they would go to the man yes this is what would happen didnt he know negroes that is know that they couldnt be depended uponthat they would shy away from the real mccoy yes this was true and he despised them for it but that was all right he could do it alone if only he could stop thinking about it yes because if his hands kept trembling he might accidentally let go of the box and then it would all be over then and there but suppose he was to get another headache like those which came sometimes to explode his temples into flames suppose this was to happen and suddenly without even knowing it he was to black out no he couldnt think about that either better to think about something else perhaps tomorrow but there too was a dead end tomorrow had always had its drawbacks for him living in the south and forced to walk the thin line between the expedient and the impossible and always aware that there was a real physical force which could with one thought simply on a hunch or a whim smash him at its will had made all of his tomorrows todays and yesterdays no better not think about tomorrow there were none for negroes it was all a myth all of their days were similar they were a timeless people but he had to think about something anything except this box and this train and what would happen after he got to the bridge yes anything but that perhaps then he should think about his father what would his father say now if he were alive and if he could see him on this journey his father would approve he knew that is of the journey and of the need for what had to be done but would his father approve of his doing it he didnt know he had been proud of his father and ofttimes before he would go out to seventh avenue to get up on the stand and speak to the people he would look at his fathers picture and recall those sundays he had sone down to the vacant lot beside bens poolroom and listened to his father speak he recalled that sad pitiful old man waving his arms and banging the wooden rostrum with his bony fists and he recalled too the sound of that voice the hatred which came with the spittle from his lips and the epithets which he aimed at his motley emotional audience the audience tired old men and young bewildered boys had shouted and cheered and sometimes brandished their fists in the air in response to his cajoling for that moment perhaps they were stirred moved made conscious of the futility of their daily existence but this spell could not long remain they had not been revolutionaries but plain simple people who knew only one thing about the class struggle that somehow they were in it and got the worse of it and that it would never be any different and true his father had had no real solution perhaps he had been rightthat is in his own mind perhaps communism was the wave of the future perhaps there in the s at the height of the new deal during the great liberal administration of franklin d roosevelt when one negro was being lynched every week and each negro child was destined to a mental if not physical death by the age of yes perhaps communism or any ism was the answer but his fathers audience these ignorant people had been wiser than their mentor they had seen in the violent revolution not the eventual victory of the proletariat but instead the victory of the power structure which would after a decisive victory go on to emulate the germans and exterminate negroes indiscriminately en masse and they had seen too that there was growing within all of this chaos and disruption a negro bourgeoisie which would dedicate itself to maintaining the status quo and no matter how much they too despised the negro middle class the ones with the fine homes and the big carsthey also on the other hand sought to emulate them and they dreamed of the day when they might be like them and so his father had been defeated because of the inability of his audience to believe after they had left the power of his oratory that the world painted by his words was the real one he was glad that his father had died early he knew that had he lived he would have eventually gone insane or cut his throat yes he believed this because his father was an intellectual and the negro intellectual at some stage of his life is forced to give up his illusions part with his ideals desert the world of mysticism and become immersed in the pragmatic world of harsh cold reality always he walks the thin line between sanity and insanity seeing death not as an awesome antagonist but perhaps as a more comforting alternative to him reality is not that which inspires but instead that which defeats that which pushes one willingly hopefully to his own destruction yes better that his father had died before the death of his illusions better that he had died before he had come to realize that the new day would never be yes he had died at the right timethe train came to a halt at fiftyninth street the sudden stop threw him back against the seat his hand relaxed and the box began to slide down his thigh his eyes opened wide and for a moment he sat almost paralyzed the box fell to the seat and tottered between his legs on the edge he couldnt move he sat there watching it unable to bring his arm around the box tumbled over as the train pulled off the little boy sitting near him on the other side of the seatthe one facing him reached down and caught the box minutes before it hit the floor here your package mistuh he said he opened his eyes mechanically he stretched out his hand thanks he wiped his forehead with the back of his hand then he put both hands tightly around the box he was breathing deeply and the sweat glistened on his high black forehead he glanced at the boy then he looked to the right at a white woman she turned her eyes away he snarled and turned back to the boy did the boy realize how frightened he himself had been could this black boy when handing him the box see by the light of fear in his own eyes that fear also in his no perhaps not perhaps this was the trouble perhaps none of them could really know the others fear and thus each interpreted his own misery in his own way and perhaps too this was why the great union had never been not even in slavery itself had their travails and misfortunes been of general and similar intensity this is why john brown failed this is why the violent revolution could never be each negro interpreted his misery in his own way and measured it according to his own instruments but he would change all of this yes he and his box would set into motion that chain of reactions which would lead inevitably to a final solidification would force negroes to unite in their own common selfinterest suppose he told the boy what he had in that box what he intended to do with it he looked at the tennis shoes sliced at both ends on the boys feet he shook his head when his eyes moved to the dirty blue denim pants and the old torn faded white tee shirt the boy kept his dazed young eyes on the floor alexander carefully slid one hand away from the box and reaching into his pocket brought out a crumpled dollar bill he gave it to the boy thanks the boy said he crumpled the bill in his hands smiling for a moment his face beaming and then finally went back to searching the floor with his eyes a living dead man he whispered turning away from the boy yes a living dead man you couldnt possibly understand me no even though what im going to do is for you yes if it happens and if afterwards there is a new life it will be yours you will have to come up from the rubble and shape a world in your own image but you wouldnt understand no i could never explain it to you the train reached thirtyfourth street and the boy got off walking slowly his head down alexander watched him disappear but no one else had understood him either no none of those who had sat with him in the basement of that dingy roachinfested room in harlem one night after the first riot and these were the rebels these were the men devoted to the destruction of the system they had preceded him into the dark dimlylit basement which smelled of urine and served as the nesting place for the lean sleek furry rats which came night and day to assault men women and children three men were there roger watkins tall rangy lanky his hair bushed on his head in the an naturel style of the black nationalists alexander had met roger in a history class at city college scheid ali was also there he was a short fat man with an oval face and small sleepy brown eyes leader of a new religious sect which based its dogma on a far eastern religion his sect stressed the coming destruction of white civilization alexander did not know the third man later he found out that the mans name was james king king was of medium height and had bright skin and soft wavy hair and whereas the others even alexander himself had been shabbily dressed king was neatly almost immaculately attired he wore an ivy league threebutton suit with a conservative looking velvet collar his tie was knotted in the college fashion and the collar of his silk shirt was folded neatly around it he had a bulova watch on his arm its band the same gold color as the big ring which sparkled on his finger king was the liaison man between many civil_rights groups and sometime before he had organized a march of ministers college teachers and middle class negroes on the capital of a northern state king was speaking as alexander came in i say the riots ruined us there wasnt no sense in it the ones who did the rioting wasnt interested in no civil_rights what can you expect man asked sheid these people got a legitimate bitch against the man what they was stealing was stole before from them maybebut king started to retort roger cut him off these people got no jobs they cant make it nobody can make it without a job so they stole but its our fault because we dont do enough for the people theres enough capital here in harlem for these people to make jobs for themselves thats our problem in a nutshell we dont give the black people jobs but whyd they steal whiskey asked king hunh you tell me that what has whiskey got to do with a murdered negro boy ill tell you replied scheid the black man in america is what the man wants him to be yeah this is their trouble there aint nothing they can do until they break away from him thats malarkey replied king they got nowhere to go and they wouldnt go nowhere anyway you act like this isnt their country it aint interjected watkins ill be damned if its not shouted king waving his hands they came here before most of these damned foreigners yes sir they was here no said scheid they didnt come the man brought them wellall righthave it your way said king anyway theyre here and they are not going anywhere he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and what im saying is that they got to beat mr charlie at his own game and if they work it right they can do it at that moment the men had noticed that alexander was present he greeted them shook hands all around accepted the can of beer and pulled a folding chair from the wall he sat next to scheid across from king the answer king went on is politics we got enough negroes in harlem to damn near run the city but nobody uses this power thats whats wrong use it for what asked scheid the man puts up somebody to run and comes and asks you to vote for him there aint no difference between no two men republican or democrat about the black manbut no let me finish scheid shouted king down if they had their own state someplace of their own they could elect their own men men who would mean something to their people that aint even it watkins who had been trying to speak before finally broke in they got a state right here in harlem look outside and as far as you can see there aint nothing but black people i say they can build their own businesses set up their own programs and do something for themselves it wont do no good said scheid the white man is doomed with all the blood on his hands god cant possibly let him live naw and if black people stay with him they gonna be doomed too theyve got to break away here alexander had spoken for the first time now we have another god you talk about everything that the man has done but the worst thing is to give us a concept like god jehovah allah economics politics theyre all god man and what we have to do is to get rid of the gods i dont understand you man said king what i mean is that we have to tear down everything the whole structure we cant leave anything standing all of it is rotten youre an anarchist king accused hes sick watkins said we had this argument before yes he replied and i couldnt convince you then and i wont convince you now but as long as you let this system stand and you worship all of its gods nothing will ever happen there will never be a change no said watkins because too many negroes think like you they down on their own people im down on hypocrites and phonies and i dont give a damn if theyre black or white i know that black children are dying out there in the streets and its just as much your fault as it is the mans king stood up he stretched himself and looked at the others youre all wrong he said you dont give the people enough credit theyve got the man on the run and they can keep him there if they use their power we have no power alexander said weve got nothing but a bible some godhouses and people who dont know how much better off they would be dead he turned his eyes to the ceiling the other men were coming back at him now each shouting to be heard above the other but he no longer heard them the pain had come to deaden the left side of his face would it ever be gone no not really he knew that it would reappear again and again sneaking up on him like a thief in the dark and maybe he didnt want it to be gone maybe he wanted it to keep coming back to him as a reminder of all that was that had been and that would always be maybe he wanted it to be with him always because in this way he could always hate both that sneering sadistic white face behind the arm which had wielded the gun butt and that cynical snarling look on the black face of the man who had helped to hold him down when the pain had finally subsided he noticed that they werent talking to him any longer they were all examining the contents of a box which watkins had set on a milk crate in the center of the circle this is the mccoy he said this is it what is it he asked take a look said scheid carefully removing the cover from the box for christs sake go easy shouted king alexander bent over and looked into the box then he straightened up quickly shaking his head and bent down to take another look yes he had been right the first time there were six sticks of dynamite each carefully packed some distance from the other the spaces between each stick were filled with cotton whew he exclaimed whats the pitch they all looked at king king stood up and stretched i took it from some goddamn kids who were gonna blow up something what were they gonna blow up asked alexander i dont know but i talked them out of it king walked away to get a can of beer he came back to the little circle thatd ruin us for sure coming on top of the riots itd finish the movement what are you going to do with it alexander had asked man im lettin it go yeah we gonna call mr charlie and let him see what we got and what we done we gonna show him that some of us got some goddam sense he stood up he looked from the face of king to the others they shook their heads at him they agreed with king he bent down over the box again why we got to give it up he asked then he straightened up i mean why cant we use it no one replied they just looked at him halfdazed halfbewildered i think you crazy man said scheid after awhile no he protested im serious why in the hell dont we use it why dont we show the man just where we at that aint where we at said king and we aint ever gonna go there aint none of us here no murderers we dont agree on some things but that we agree on we aint gonna go that way its the only way he shouted somewhat surprised at the sound of his own voice there is no other way his eyes opened wider the perspiration had begun to roll down the sides of his face he waved his hands frantically in the air the pain had begun again at the base of his temples we cant go no other way he said softly youre a damn fool said king any spook who wants to do something like this is a damn fool he spun around sharply on his heels to confront king no thats not it he shouted through the pain thats not it at all you got no guts no none of you you dont want change we want change shouted king yeah and thats what well get but we dont want no destruction no we dont want to tear down the whole world he moved closer to king the other mans hot breath was on his forehead and so youll never get any change no because until everything is wiped awayall of it you wont have any change damn said king backing away i aint gonna talk to no damn crazy man but he spun around and came back pointing his finger but look how goddam silly the bastard is he appealed to scheid and watkins who had moved away from the two men he thinks six lousy sticks of dynamite can change something yeah he thinks that hell man said scheid that aint a drop in the bucket to what mr charlie got watkins stood up i aint against revolution you know that im all for it but man you got to have the people with you you need every black man in the country before you can do something like that no alexander replied clenching his fists and spitting the words through his teeth you need one black man who isnt afraid to die just one black man can make it baby yes this one man can make it he stopped suddenly and yelled the pain flashed across his forehead and for a moment it appeared as though he would fall to the floor scheid and watkins leaped to their feet king moved away from him they stood watching him he pressed his head with the palms of his hands the deep breathing wracked his body when he raised his head again his face was screwed up into tight knots there was another scream deep inside of him which he wanted to bring up but it wouldnt come just like always it stayed there nestled up inside of him he turned his eyes to

scheid get the box and lets make it man this bastards gone scheid lunged for the box but alexander had seen him moving toward it with an animallike scream which stopped the others in their tracks he pushed scheid away scheid already off balance toppled back over one of the folding chairs alexander kicked at scheid and in the same motion snatched up the box they halted in their tracks he laughed again the pain had gone now and his eyes were clear one step baby he threatened one step no one moved no one said anything im going to the bridge baby the brooklyn bridge the famous one comon with me baby there was silence they stood watching him nobody goin they stared menacingly at him all right baby he said and holding the big box tightly under his arm he rushed through the door the train reached the brooklyn bridge station he got off up on the surface he breathed in the salty air he began to walk toward the bridge in back of him the tall buildings reached up to the sky like bars running from earth to heaven and in front of him the bridge lay long and sprawling like some gigantic pathway to another world on the bridge clutching tightly to the box he walked quickly his tennis shoes making harsh ominous sounds in the stillness a vagrant walked over to him he gave the man his last dollar a negro man and a white woman walked by arm in arm he smiled at them they looked at him sheepishly and walked on far in the distance stood the statue of liberty its torch lighting up the already bright sky he turned away from the statue and walked over to the beam in the center of the bridge carefully he laid the box against the beam and pulled the long fuse out from its bottom a police car cruised slowly by he pressed himself against the beam until the car had passed he fixed the box securely and started to walk away pulling the fuse with him it wouldnt be long now no the bridge would go up in smoke right with the eyes of the lady looking on the police car had turned and was now coming back across the bridge in the lane nearest him he didnt see it he had taken out his cigarette lighter and turned once again to look at the statue there were tears in his eyes soon it would be over yes after the explosion he would go down to the police station and turn himself in he would tell them why he had done it too he already knew what he would say between me and your country there is a vendetta yes it has always been that way and it always will and i know now that there cant be any compromise no the compromise would have to be with human beings this level you have secured for yourself but i no longer want to compromise no i want to destroy you yes to tear down your world rung by rung pillar by pillar yes this is what i want he lit the fuse and watched as the flame begin to travel its length then he saw the policemen they had slid out of the car and were advancing toward him halt the voice rang out he began to run down the narrow walkway a shot tore into the wooden plank near his feet he ran faster another car had come up now directly facing him the men slid out before the car rolled to a stop the two policemen stood before him with guns poised aimed at his belly one of the men was a big brown negro the other husky and white alexander threw up his hands and screamed the first bullet tore a large hole in his stomach the second ripped away a piece of his private from behind a bullet ploughed into his skull back and front the bullets assaulted his body until at last he fell in a bloody dismembered heap to the platform he kicked his legs once in the air and shook his head then he lay still the flame still made its way to the box the other policemen had come up with mine sweepers and other devices but it was too late the fuse had burnt its way to the sticks the men began to run the police who had remained in the two cars whipped the cars around quickly and began to speed away a short distance from the bridge they stopped and turned to look back mustve been a dud said one of the policemen yeah answered another looking away sheepishly james king slid from one of the cars he had his monogrammed brief case under his arm that was one crazy spook he whispered to a negro policeman the policeman spat on the ground and walked away the derelict came back across the bridge he looked at the body lying still motionless shook his head and walked on finally the other policeman came back and covered the body with a clean white sheet heres a motion picy rip f ture popping up here l and there in art theatres around the country northern sector called

directed specifically toward all black people in america that others would hear it is not important some nonblacks will react but most will not of course it would be tragic to prepare such an elaborate system and then broadcast a poor speech good or bad however it should ring out suddenly without warning something like this hey nigger get off your damned knees whadaya think feet were made

of fortune of fame of richesyou name it and someone has surmounted seemingly unconquerable odds to reach a cherished goal but most of the time the prince of love has been the love for a woman i will

black womanuntil she begins to respect herself miss lincoln made reference to the propensity of most americans to glorify all that is white and to deride the hopes the aspirations and the natural appearance of black americans this attitude is found exceptions to her monologue on the neglected disrespected black woman accepting the essence of her plight i will still contend that the black woman stands much taller than miss lincoln sees her the plight of the black woman is a manifestation of the plight of the black man this primeval use of the black woman grows out of the degradation of the black man as was stated in the opening of the article who will revere the black woman the comedown you cant do that or you are a negro comes too often to the ambitious young negro and he or she must con vince himself or herself that anything can be done despite the odds let me again say i will revere the black woman in all her splendor draped in the finest costume that man can produce or money can buy touched with the hand of god like makeup to enhance her beauty or disguise her ugliness i will revere her i will revere her in dirty rags and natural comeliness with a smile on my face i will tell her that she is a splended creature and is much to be admired moreover i will give her complete respect and advance in the face of danger to protect her i will proclaim her virtue and defend her innocence in deeds i will promote the sentiment among men that black is beautiful and gentle honest and faithful i will glorify each instance of greatness and crown the head of the victorious but most of all i will praise and promote her heritage with all my mind strength and courage i will seek to obtain the best place in society for her seat give her every comfort that life can afford that she may be able to take her rightful place among the highest when it is done i will proclaim to all the world that god has made no mistake in creating the black woman and man that the world is richer and more beautiful because of this black orchid this laden rose of sharon is set high in the grandeur of humanity yes abbey i will go to the out houses and call black women to come into the pavilion to join the horde of women who are passing through to a new life with new hope i will dispel the notion that black women are jealous and evil moreover i will gather about me men who will do the same and we will bind up the bruised head comfort the broken heart and bid our fellow men to resort to violence no more i will join the poets in writing and saying lovely enchanting words to the black woman and about her i will protect her right to choose or refuse romance to insist upon nobler terms than the outhouses or the subjected homes of misuse and abuse i will spread my coat for the black woman to walk upon keep a strong arm for her to hold on to build her a castle for shelter from nature kindle a fire to keep her warm give her children to love most of all i will give her the respect and devotion that will make her queen of her house in this she will be confident and proud beyond her door cast now your eyes upon the field of the black harvest see what the black man and black woman have wrought all the world stands aghast despite the scorn there is respect despite the criticism there is praise despite the wanton lust to exploit there is deep reverence for no man has ever beheld anything more glorious than the versatility of the magnificent black woman in all her shades hues lines and contours proportioned yet i alone cannot redeem the black woman the image of the black man lies buried beneath the pall of hopeless dreams this abandonment of logic and aggressiveness has become too much a motive for apathy the baby must be magnified black the boy must know that his place is anywhere under the sun or beneath the shades of night and there with him is and belongs the black woman she must be there and remain there until her honesty courage beauty virtue hopes and aspirations are known and realized i am to the fore and always will be yes i will revere the black woman let her cry to me her rape her aching head her abandonment her shameful use by charlie come to me my black princess and i will be your knight the september issue of y rip negro digest fea i s tured a most perceptive and p rovocative article by miss abbey lincoln which asked the question who will revere the black woman i am constrained to answer that nobody will revere the black womanuntil she begins to respect herself miss lincoln made reference to the propensity of most americans to glorify all that is white and to deride the hopes the aspirations and the natural appearance of black americans this attitude is of course a part of the legacy othe institution of human slavery as it was practiced and experienced on the north american continent the slave was a chattel an item of commerce a thing stripped of rights denied humanity he was bred and used as a beast with little or no reference to the precepts of morality or human dignity the north american christian attempted to justify such treatment of other children of god by simply denying the common humanity of blacks and whites blacks were to be treated as animals because blacks were animals placed on earth for the use and convenience of the real humans the whites our blackness was to be a sign of inferiority a sign of shame it followed then that the closer one came to shedding ones heritage of negritude the closer one came to being human to be slavishly imitative of everything white was to be on the path to quasihuman status it is tragic that this conviction of black inferiority not only was but is the dominant american racial feeling not just of whites but among blacks as well and this returns us to the question of respect for negro women the bitter fact is that perhaps a majority of black women would resent even being called black too often the black woman seeks acceptance and emotional security by imitating all of the downright vulgar traits of the most insipid and superficial of white american females what makes so many black women believe that cheap and glossy little cindy lou is the epitome of femininity miss lincoln makes mention of the compulsive frying of black womens hair by other black womentheir refusal to accept the fact that black women are most beautiful when they proudly acknowledge their negritude and quit trying to be what they will never succeed in being and ought not to want to be anyway miss lincoln wrote of skinbleaching sessions and other means of self and groupdegradation one would have more reason to evere black womanhood if more black women could surmount their selfhatred long enough to realize that quite a few of us black men are not at all repelled by broad facial features or broad behinds or countenances which are black and shiny for when the black woman reveres so highly the straightening comb she betrays to blacks and whites male and female alike her own lack of selfesteem and her lack of esteem for black males as well it is difficult to conjure up much respect for such a forlorn creature who does not even respect herself and it is irrelevant that so many white american girls are also vulgar and shallow whites can be our persecutors but we can only be betrayed on this issue of our own standards by other blacks it is galling and senseless that partially emancipated slaves persist intheir eager selfenslavement to all of the frivolities which their former masters can dream up it seems that this is just another sad instance of our glad acceptance of the least attractive items that white america has to offer it is certainly depressingly instructive to reflect on the sizeable amount of rent and food money which is being spent the wigs for the black ghettos some may object that i am unduly critical of black women for accepting the myth of white superiorityblack inferiority which a large majority of americans black and white including most negro males also believe in and suffer from but our women are the repositories and the exemplars of our standards of beauty and so long as our standards of beauty reject all that is natural about ourselves and accept the most artificial of white values we will not rate in our own estimation that equality which we demand of our society those of us who earnestly desire a just a stable and a peaceful resolution of the present menacing third chapter in the unfolding american dilemma are aware that the new society which we must build cannot be based upon superficial good feeling overlaying outmoded concepts of group or selfhate and the first step in attaining the status which our humanity deserves is our own acceptance of ourselves not as black imitation whiteys but as our own black selves unashamed of our birthright of dusk and shadow for who will revere any of us if we do not even respect ourselves two paraphrase mark t twain everyone talks about the black revolution but no one does anything about it the movement seems to be unable to recover from the martyrdom of malcolm and unable to learn from and be guided by his life his death was a terrible blow but martyrs are often more effective dead than alive malcolm achieved immortality during his last year when he rejected racism and embraced orthodox islam a universalist religion by escaping from the trap of reversing the symbols he freed us to create new symbols many of his followers cannot understand the profound significance of malcolms religious conversion experiences and try to reduce him to a vulgar political figure both black nationalists and white liberals each for their own reasons ignore malcolm the universalist humanitarian because the black revolutionist has not learned enough from the life of malcolm he tends to become a cultist offering ritualistic compensation for blackness andor a poseur playing the role of spokesman of the black masses for the benefit of those white folks who dont know any better the masses is a great abstraction for the black revolutionist if he comes from a bourgeois family he does not know them and has been taught to despise them if he comes from the ghetto he escapes from the masses into revolutionary politics usually a cathartic talkmarathon signifying nothing the ghetto is hard to take cold sober everyone finds an escape religion for old ladies alchohol for the mature drugs for the young the children are the only realists the black masses as an abstraction is an invaluable defense mechanism for the black revolutionist to relate to the people of the ghetto to look unblinkingly at their faults their virtues their suffering their potential to give love and compassionthe only thing that can win their confidencerequires saintliness k william kgositsiles article is the black revolutionist a phony negro digest july is the first breath of fresh air on a scene that has become an exercise in futility it is honest it asks the questions which must be asked it is oriented towards psychic autonomy as a constructive substitute for the sterile game of reacting to whitey when he says we are inherently more interested in humanity than in the material values of the white western world he has pronounced a liberating phrase a philosophy that can transform the black masses and detach them from things as symbols of power and loveobjects which are a cold compensation for helplessness and lovelessness there is a certain dignity in avowed slavery avowed slaves work because they are captured or kidnapped or sold or born into slavery they are chained and beaten thats why they work for their oppressors even the wage slaves that marx wrote about in the th century had some dignity they worked or they starved thats a good reason to work but the modern western worker works because the system stole his mind he strives for things which represent worthiness and the less worthy he feels the more desperately he strives this craving for objects as symbols of power and love poisons relations between husband and wife between parents and children he ends up loving no one and nothing but his car i think polishing ones car has become a widespread form of sexual perversion a psychologist should think up a name for it the modern western worker may work harder than a slave and never think his own thoughts but he believes he is free and to me that is the very depths of degradation for all the extraordinary qualities of the ghettoized their perceptiveness their basic grasp of reality their ingenuity inventiveness adaptability ability to endure and survive stress to an almost incredible extent their latent spirituality and transcendence they still largely accept the image which the white world has of them the children still insult each other by calling each other black and nigger or saying your mother is blackin spite of all the newly independent nations of africa and because the black masses are at the bottom of the pecking order the ghetto becomes a caricature of empty materialist values e franklin frazier called the black bourgeoisie exaggerated americans its not just the bourgeoisie the ghettoized hardly believe in their own existence and cling to objects and roles in dread of nothingness the black criminal clings to his evil if you tell him hes not evil he panics malcolm came up from degradation that is normal it is the degraded of the ghetto who have the greatest potential they are the least socialized the unwilling slaves to society never the willing slaves rewards mean little because they never expect to get any punishments they learn to live with they must either become saints or die and everyone knows that the ghettoized are experts at survival if the black masses are hung up in the material values of the white western world the black revolutionary intellectuals are hung up in the social thought of this same white western world any theory is an attempt to make some sense out of reality but theory like logic is not truth it is a tool which when properly used helps man to understand and cope with reality when the theory masters the man it screens out the reality that conflicts with the theory during the th century when western man became enamoured with science he convinced himself on the basis of faith that there were laws which determined the development of society that man was profoundly rational and that one had only to discover these laws and point out to ones fellows where their selfinterest lies to solve the problems of the world social thinkers in the west marxist and nonmarxist alike are still caught up in this delusion their response to their failure is more and more frantic intellectualization which only serves to further aggravate their alienation from reality and to insulate themselves from their intuitions the result is intellectual escapism compounded by a feeling of helplessness in the face of inexorable social forces freudianism while correcting the view of man as essentially rational added a new ingredient of panic the unconscious was evil and destructive holding terrible secrets which we dared not face i believe contemporary western social thought is an intellectualization of martin luthers vision of man as absolutely depraved and lacking in free will the enthronement of rationality stems from distrust of emotion the concept of man and society as being determined by inexorable laws stems from denial of free will the externalization of social change processes reduced man to the role of a cipher but if we allow ourselves to perceive the reality of social change we find that the revolution is not so much out there as it is in herein the mind and soul of man because man tends to become what he believes he is spirituality is a powerful highly contagious emotion and in my view mankinds most profound emotion a revolution in the psyche of one man can become an allpowerful force for social change st malcolm was such a man the historical evidence is impressive and i hope the reader will bear with me while i make a detailed summary of the findings of the distinguished anthropologist anthony f c wallace wallace studies revitalization movements which are attempts to abruptly innovate whole cultural systems shifting relationships into a new pattern they are reactions to extreme stress induced by an unsatisfactory society and an attempt to reorganize society in order to reduce stress he made a comparative study of several hundred religious movements both western and nonwestem on five continents and abstracted common features of these movements for radical change those involved in such movements perceive the culture or major areas of it as a system feel that it is unsatisfactory innovate not merely discrete items but a new cultural system specifying new relationships and in some cases new traits wallace projects the concept of the mazeway or the image of nature society culture personality and body as seen by one person the mazeway is related to concepts of self worldview and behavioral environment wallace does not explain the mazeway too well but i think he means it is the socially determined manner of perceiving and evaluating which screens out sensory and evaluative data which conflict with what one expects to perceive within the framework of what one has been taught to perceive wallace says that when stress is unrelieved the person is under great pressure to change the mazeway while wallace does not explain the cause of the unrelieved pressure i would speculate that such stress arises from a sharp and growing conflict between the image of the world as perceived through the mazeway and the world as it exists in reality or applying the concept to the united states at the present time unrelieved stress results from the conflict between the intuitive knowledge of the world which is strongest in the young and their sociallyconditioned conscious perceptions and evaluations changing the mazeway involves changing the total gestalt of the image of self society culture nature body and ways of action it also may be necessary to change the real system by this think he means the social structure to bring the new mazeway and reality into congruence the effort to work a change in mazeway and real system together so as to permit more effective stress reduction is the effort at revitalization and the collaboration of a number of persons in such an effort is called a revitalization movement all religions have their origin in revitalization movements societies go through five overlapping stages in what he calls the processual structure the steady state in which people are reasonably satisfied with the culture except for a few individuals for example psychotics period of individual stress in which growing numbers of people are subject to increasing stress and begin to consider alternatives period of cultural distortion which is a prolonged period of stress and anxiety provoking the following responses a rigid response the person tolerates high stress rather than admit innovation b flexible response new techniques more or less in conflict with the mazeway are adopted in personal life c regressive response uncontrolled dissipation introgroup violence passivity dependency indolence psychosomatic disorders depression and selfreproach corruption in public office the culture becomes internally distorted stress continues to rise resulting in disillusionment with the mazeway this period could lead to the death of the society or to the fourth stage revitalization or mazeway reformulation the movement promoting revitalization can be religious or secular but it always begins with an abrupt and dramatic moment of insight a realization of relationships and opportunities in the mind of one person such an event can be described as inspiration or revelation in religious movements the prophet or messiah receives one or more visions the content of his message is universal obey the moral rules and practice the rituals or personal and social catastrophy will result in secular movements or religious movements in which the innovator does not see visions the process is a moment of insight but in all cases it is sudden and dramatic a radical inner change in personality takes place soon after the vision experience the one receiving the insight or revelation feels a sense of mission or messianic obligation the visions have been called personality transformation dreams they occur in a waking state or in an ecstatic trance and impress the dreamer immediately as being meaningful and important their manifest content is largely rational a wellconsidered intellectual argument and a cogent moral exhortation the personality goes through a radical change in a positive therapeutic sense prophets believe they have communicated with the supernatural but unlike psychodcs they do not lose their sense of personal identity but psychotics tend to become the object of their spiritual longing once the mazeway reformulation has been completed the movement enters into a second stage which wallace calls communication the prophet attracts disciples and converts who believe they are coming under the care and protection of a supernatural being and that both the convert and society will benefit from identification with the new culture system the next stage is organization during which the movement takes shape sometimes there is a division of labor between the prophet and a disciple who is the organizer or political leader the converts to the movement undergo a revitalizing personality change the next stage is adaptation as the movement becomes stronger resistance is provoked and it evolves strategy for coping with resistance some strategies are doctrinal modifications to make it more acceptable political and diplomatic maneuvers and force the next stage is cultural transformation in which the entire or controlling portions of the population accept the new religion re vitalization occurs reduction of personality deterioration symptoms extensive cultural changes enthusiastic embarkation upon organized programs of group action these programs can be more or less realistic the next stage is routinization in which the new mazeway finds general acceptance the movement shrinks to a purely religious function eg the preservation of doctrine and the performance of ritual finally a new steady state emerges which is viable and different in content from the old steady state wallace says there are two major variables determining the success or failure of the movement the realism of its doctrine and the amount of force exerted by its opponents if the organization cannot predict successfully the consequences of its own moves and of its opponents moves in a power struggle its demise is very likely in order to survive the movement must be canny about conflict and the amount of resistance must be low the conventionality of the doctrine does not appear to be an important variable the doctrine can be extremely unconventional as long as the leaders are realistic i have burdened the reader with a detailed summary of the wallace article because i find his view of secular revolutionary movements as being essentially religious more convincing than the view that religious movements are essentially secular in short i have more faith in faith than in rationality but more important i believe that wallaces concept of the revitalization movement is extremely relevant to the black revolution and to the role of malcolm in it it seems clear to me that malcolm is the revitalizing messianic figure capable of saving a society on the brink of destruction if his followers can recognize who he is and emulate him any movement which leaves the old mazeway intact is necessarily shallow and manipulative slogans such as we want what youve got implies that what youve got is of value a revolutionary movement must be realistic i am afraid that revolutionary theoreticians trapped by enlightenment social thought emphasizing the struggle out there and seldom realizing that there is a struggle in here sometimes go to absurd lengths trying to apply hoary abstract theories to problems which they obscure rather than solve one example is the definition of the strategic goal of a revolution as seizure of state power there is some real basis for such a concept in the deep south especially in the rural black belt area such an attempt in large urban centers in the north is not cool at all but it is perfectly realistic to be the real power in the ghetto and outside the ghetto in relationship to racist murderers or potential racist murderers all that is needed is the confidence of the masses effective black institutions render white institutions irrelevant and because many theoreticians consider economics the most essential question they tilt at windmills trying to find a fundamental economic solution which does not exist one can demand jobs ad infinitum and get no more than token results if not reversals because the structure of the economy is precipitously reducing the demand for unskilled labor some say that the answer is socialism but a substantial number of whites would have to go along with such a solution then what happens to the autonomy of the black revolution unless one projects the seizure of power and the carrying through of a socialist transformation by blacks on their own that does not strike me as very realistic either another variant of the search for a fundamental economic solution is the ideal of a separate autonomous black economy the latter solution i believe is as unrealistic as the former if the black revolution can become the real power in the ghetto many of the abuses especially the parasitic ones can be corrected while this is not a fundamental economic solution it would help along with the usual demands for economic reform perhaps the black masses may never have what whiteys got but why not encourage people to become themselves instead of aspiring after the rotten materialist values of the west when m kgositsile makes the impassioned cry where is our program of action he articulates the feelings of many people possibly one explanation for the paralysis is the impact of western social thought which is in an advanced state of decay lets hope that we can surprise ourselves not out of the window but into the ghetto to relate to the real flesh and blood people who live there i feel it incumbent i g upon me as a young t black deeply committed g a s ffer menting black liberation movement to respond to some of the conclusions and implications suggested in dr price m cobbs analysis of the american identity crisis as it manifests itself in urban insurrections and violence by black people in general journeys to black identity negro digest july without doubt dr cobbs analysis is a brilliant and refreshing explanation of the psychopathology that plagues black and white america he states in no uncertain terms basic underlying motivating factors which scientifically explain the violence blacks now perpetrate in the streets of american cities indeed i think his article may be regarded as a major psychosociological essay concerning violence and identity as it is related to the black liberation movement and for this dr cobbs is to be given full credit and a sincere extension of gratitude from all of us who are constantly attempting to come to a greater understanding of problems we are facing however i cannot help but take issue with some of the concluding inferences suggested by his article when dr cobbs states that black men in america can only go part of the way alone in the establishment of his manhood and that the attainment of an effective and mature manhood by black men can in the final analysis only be permanently achieved through cooperation with others i am forced to denounce this kind of reasoning as logically as well as psychologically inconsistent with a true understanding of what is real in the white psychological milieu the recognition that many whites in america suffer from the same identity problem as do blacks thereby linking them in a common bond so far as the identity problem is concerned is indeed a correct and valid observation and i take no issue with dr cobbs on that point what i do take issue with dr cobbs on is his inference that this might serve as a uniting bond between the dehumanized blacks and the dehumanized whites and together these two dehumanized identitydenied groups may effectively strike out against the thingscentered culture that has dehumanized both of them i choose to label the situation that black and white people in america have been subject to as one of dehumanization of which the identitydenial problem is but one aspect of this more inclusive program once again i am forced into a position of complete agreement with dr cobbs insight regarding the violent potentialities of other nonblack identitydenied factions of the society indeed the history of white racist lynching validates this point beyond repudiation however i think the dynamics of identitydenied violence and its possible manifestations by nonblack members of this society need further explanation with whom are manhoodidentity seeking blacks to unite for the effective establishment of their manhood and identity since according to dr cobbs they cannot travel the entire length of this road alone are they to seek and expect help from those persons who in attempting to dehumanize them have been dehumanized also whence is the coalition to spring besides is a coalescence between the dehumanized dregs of white racist america and an anxious angry and aware also armed black america desirable or even feasible these questions are obviously rhetorical any clearthinking man whether he be black or white can easily recognize the absurdity of dr cobbs position if black manhood and black identity are to be truly authentic and significant it can only be meaningful and lasting if it is fully and completely the fruits of an allblack effort the same applies to the white identity and dehumanization problem if it is too to be effective and meaningful it must be achieved wholly by white efforts granted that the problem that confronts both groups is the offspring of the same parents decadent christianity and misguided capitalismbut the children have grown and matured in two entirely different settings any attempted merger of the two at this ripe old age could only result in compounded chaos and confusion let us examine for a moment the most possible manifestation in which the identitydenied violence of white america might declare itself as noted earlier this type of violence already has a rich history of manifestation in lynchings castrations and rapes to assume that they will in the future be directed toward someone other than black people is i think unjustifiable moral and historical naivete what is more likely to take place is that the more blacks move to recapture their humanity and establish iden tities whites will attempt to block this with every means at their disposal for we must remember that the valuesymbols of identity and masculinity that white americans have managed to delude themselves into thinking are meaningful have been maintained and realized at the expense of black people and the harder blacks try to establish a meaningful black identity the more they undermine the foundation on which socalled white masculinity and identity rest for the only common identity conscious or unconscious that most white people share is that of white superiority the only way most white men in america experience some feeling of masculinity is by identification with james bond or tarzantype pictures or by some outright oppressive acts of violence against blacks to be sure whites have an identity this common identity that they have is based on their unconscious collective acts of oppression against blacks and is no more real than the images they have forced on blacks and the unreality of it becomes increasingly more apparent as blacks move towards liberation through affirmative acts of violence the more blacks seek to acquire their identity through affirmative acts of violence the more white america will respond with totalitarian and oppressive acts indeed what is at stake is the whole system of white superiority values on which rest their identity symbols the fact that both whites and blacks have an identity problem only heightens the possibility of armed confrontation between the two groups it does not mitigate the possibilities nor can it serve as a uniting force as dr cobbs article subtly suggests indeed the present psychological symbols for masculinity in america conflict directly with what i understand to be the aims of the black liberation movement frustrated white identityseekers will most assuredly seek to identify with these symbols blacks are moving to destroy and replace the present white symbols of manhood and to a certain extent already have been successful the more successful they are the more desperate white identityseekers will become til finally they will attempt to resort to their most base and blatant display of manhood castration or murder of black men and savage rape of black women this i maintain is more likely to be the manifestation of white americanidentity seeking for in actuality white america is not really seeking an authentic identity historical truth would cause them to go insane but rather it is attempting to preserve and perpetuate the existing identity valuesymbols one closing note relative to the concern of dr cobbs that the american identity may remain white while the democratic system is destroyed the main problem of the socalled democratic system in this country is that it has always defined and manifested itself to black people as wholly and completely white american in identity indeed the two are inextricable the coalition between white and black identity seekers is a historical psychological and moral impossibility the achievement of black identity and authentic moral manliness can only be achieved by black people alone the denial of this by dr cobbs is scientific inconsistency or academic infantilism i cannot help but detect in these outlandish purportments by dr cobbs that same old slave cowardice and feeling of helplessness and estrangement whenever the slavemaster is not permitted to run things in the last few years the trend in womens hairdos has turned towards the natural look popularized by miriam makeba odetta and joanna lasane pictured above in the laymans circles only the hippest women are supposedly brave enough to wear it in a black nationalist sense it can be viewed as a symbol of feminine freedom from white standards increasing numbers of women have begun to wear naturals and this would seem to indicate that more black women are interested in exhibiting some racial pride however even though this may be true we should not overlook the fact that frequently the visible signs of protest and radical movements become meaningless and mutilated over a period of time because people who want to be hip and inpick up the symbol for whatever social gains are attached to it they are in many cases to tally unaware of the aesthetic idea which produced it one wonders if it is fair to count them as converts to the new religion i choose to call black who if anybody should wear her hair natural what does it mean when a woman cuts her hair wears it short and kinky in a world where negroes are trying a different brand of race pride everyday certainly there has been enough printed matter on what it means to be a negro in america but reading such material is obviously not the weapon we need to handle the situations we know of unless it can teach us to understand and then manipulate the audacious situations which daily confront us the most conspicious way a black woman can protest the prevailing beauty system is to cut off her hair when i was a child the old folks used to say man is gods glory woman is mans glory and hair is womans glory and the interpretation of this has been the more hair the better the straighter the better and the longer the better but those who can only read their names can point out that the book does not specify long or short glory straight or nappy glory and so on nevertheless black women have for years waged losing battles with hot combs grease sweat rain water of all kinds and origins to adhere to the standards set down by the system when the howl for integration began and finally died down to echoes of assimilation the wig and permanent had their most elaborate debut here was a way by which one could transcend the humiliating reminder that one was not white forego all the heated discomfort of maintaining ones glory the result was instant whiteness only the skin remained to point out the enlightened and the ignorant and once again we rocked our chairs too far backwards and our piecequilted values slipped off our laps yet we rocked content that at last we had patched up the ugly and they laughed and made money off our mixmatched blackness we do not know nor can we imagine who the first modern afroamerican woman was to shove the system into the melting pot and wear her hair mostly the way it was we can be certain however that when she did this a new kind of homosapien was revealed to her she met whites and black bourgeoisies who were furious and disgusted by her lack of judgement and tasteher nerve for extolling the ugly she met brothers and sisters who laughed and turned their heads because she was a mirror and their reflections were too bright too clear people stared on buses and leaned out of cars and muttered go back to africa and nappyheaded devil black women apologized that they had nothing against it for those few who could wear it but that they couldnt because their faces werent the proper shape their hair not the kinking texture excuses were given when none were asked excuses came when none were needed and the real issue was obvious we have been lumped together into huge bags made of lies that the power structure invented and now the bags were full of holes and decaying and we were stupidly fumbling around trying to stay in them the lies black is evil and ugly thick lips and kinky hair are unsightly and so forth and forever if we let it be we were spooned the lies and we digested them and when we first saw and tasted black beauty which is a part of black truth we were experiencing a food we have been starving for throughout years of mental embalment for the natural look is only one crumb of a giantsized loaf of bread black pride is the main dish it can be served in the form of studying our beautiful black history wearing african clothes thinning shoe leather in marches and countless other ways the real issue is not the hair its only importance lies in its relationship to the whole black pride is the menu and it can never be served too often for we can spice it up or water it down like hash and potatoeswhenever it is set before us we will always be able to recognize it if it is who should wear the natural look and what does it mean all those who want to be in that way black beautiful and trueand these are no small things for in truth there is strength and therein lies freedom it is worthwhile for me to mention and important for those who question the unfamiliar faces of black truth to know that someone with perhaps a tanned but not so black face will remind them when they forget that essentially there is no difference between the blacks who wax in afroamerican style and the negroes who wallow in archaic white standards the fire that mr baldwin speaks of will be allconsuming allencompassing and when charlie turns the hoses on and attempts to put it out those emulating him will not be protected by any plastic invisible shield we will all get wet and we had best arm ourselves with steel shields of blackness coated with red rubies of truthnatural in their origin absolute in aim campbell is s an actor at detroits concepteast theater a bushyhaired barrel or a black man who likes to strut on stage and trumpet a poem he composed entitled let freedom ring kaping kaping he mocks a rifle at its conclusion then after a pause comes the cruel irony damn fool dont you know thats freedoms ring campbells verse devastating in its directness describes a state of mind that is mushrooming in his town detroit where night snipers came to symbolize avenging assassins and in the explosion of their rage completed the birth of a breed of black man who is unafraid as a result in the days of endless dialogue and search that have followed the detroit riot the mantle of leadership has been resting more and more on the shoulders of what had been virtually an underground movement the motley group of people who call themselves black nationalists for several years detroit had been considered the center of black nationalism overshadowing even new york but the ferment of its fiery activists had drawn little public note now it is inescapable heading the citywide citizens action committee ccac formed in the riots wake for instance is rev albert cleage wouldbe politician veteran organizer a man whose angry fires scorch black people are tired of hearing i had a dream america is a nightmare the rev mr cleage calls his church central united church of christ the black nationalist church and the ccac which nominated officers at a rally attended by several hundred citizens some community leaders and organization heads now is known as the new black establishment this new establishment proposes to negotiate with and give orders to the new detroit committee composed mainly of leading white businessmen which is charged with planning the citys rebuilding ccac includes according to militant attorney milton henry some moderates some not so moderate a few who are a little radical and others who are just plain out of sight this surge of community involvement by selfstyled militants while not unexpectednationalists have built noisy if shortlived confrontations around every crisis from a poverty program cutback to a high school student boycott occurring in the past five years nevertheless has deep implications now for detroit where the nations most destructive riot has triggered an identity crisis of mass proportions middleclass negro leadership which had boasted of its ability to freely enter the smokefilled rooms of the white power structure now is in a frantic race to reclaim its connection to the negro whose plight was its only real excuse for being meanwhile this socalled negro mass seething with unlocked tensions seems likely out of the torment to spawn its own leadership the fact that leadership from the outside cannot be superimposed on this mass no matter how desirable this leadership may seem to outsiders was well demonstrated during the riot young do rag nationalists and others jeered and flung rocks at young and supposedly popular u s rep john conyers jr nearly toppling his halo in the process but as conyers himself later admitted only someone with the violent connotations of a malcolm_x could have spoken with authority to the rioters for the destruction in detroit went beyond the point of selfhating negroes lashing out at their own environment a feeling which still can be channeled through promises of improvement the naked thing that conyers confronted was the release of pentup rage by some fairly middleclass as well as lowerclass negroes and even poor whites that had been so long suppressed it was uncontrollable when it burst free a civil_rights program supposedly is not built on rage but in reason yet for black nationalists particularly black internationalist revolutionaries who consider themselves part of the worldwide struggle by black people to end their oppression anger is the prime mobilizer and this is the detroit dilemma the struggle now for the still largely uncommitted mass is being waged between the established negro leadership and the more militant forces so far aided by a greater facility for the gut talk of the people since they often are the people the militants are winning this battle their cries for action unity and change effectively capitalizing on the mood that lingers with the cinders in the citys ravaged communities it is a mood that unmistakably calls for many meaningful responses to the explicitly expressed discontent some nationalists and the term often is elastic enough to include even an outspoken speaker had begun to seize control of the riot when it was forming in the streets some do rag brothers who are considered incipient nationalists encouraged looting and arson while a few internationalists are believed to have aided the mystery snipers a riot is not a revolution explains glanton dowdell cochairman of the rev mr cleages ccac and a man who says he believes in black nationalism but sometimes at its height people geared to it find it necessary to intervene so people dont become mutilated a disciplined revolutionary will not participate in or encourage a riot unless there is no other alternative in detroit maybe there wasnt author louis lomax who journeyed here in the midst of the destruction felt nationalist involve ment in the riot had been crucial charging in a frontpage series in the detroit news that door to door salesmen peddling black_power had set the stage for the rebellion several weeks before its fires erupted and it is a fact that the celebrated blindpig whose raiding triggered the violence had also been a meeting place for minors under the tag the united community league for civic action nevertheless most local observers now agree that the riot was largely spontaneous but nationalists understandably are not surrendering without a struggle the rich philosophic gains that are theirs to be snatched from the holocaust in the riots midstream richard henry brother of milton and a technical writer issued a list of ultimatums to the city in the name of the malcolm_x society including amnesty for rioters which he claimed would quell the disturbance predictably the ultimatums were largely ignored but a key weapon remains in the hands of nationaliststhe drive for unity unity for the time being is a goal of the entire negro community unity in demanding changes unity in resisting any resulting increase in the forces of bigotry unity in defining the real needs of negroes and interpreting them to the white community and this goal of community unity closely resembles the black nationalist goal regardless of geographic boundaries language differences etc one told me we are one part of a black nation first and above all else detroit nationalists also are remarkably unified themselves separatists who want countrystates for negroes work with nationalists like rev cleage who believe negroes must control their own communities and the do rag nationalists who quote malcolm_x but imitate whites by processing their hair this new call for unity which now finds many people thinking temporarily or permanently like nationalists can be unsettling to both negroes and whites a white employee of a downtown office cornered a negro coworker proud of his white collar and equally white diction the other day and whispered worriedly say eddie what about this h rap brown why ask me i dont know as much about him as you do was the offended eddies swift reply eddie of course was lying h rap brown drew an audience of persons many milling in the streets when he spoke here recently at the dexter theater and eddie was one of them the shift to the open airing of nationalist sentiment is even more evident in the pages of the formerly conservative negro weekly the michigan chronicle shortly after n the riot rev cleage was given a column in the chronicle and one of his first pieces was entitled unite or perish avowed nationalist henry slayton also has begun writing for the chronicle one article headlining black_power can build as well as destroy the fact is the nationalists kind of talk is beginning to make sense to many negroes particularly youths who are turning inward for solutions to their problems including the new fear of genocide through vietnam which is gaining currency in the community the only people the white community respects are those who speak up nadine brown communitylabor figure and newspaper columnist who openly identifies herself as a nationalist told a ccac rally and some of the people present had heard many other speakers received many promises in this town where labor unions taught negroes the meaning of militancy and organization and the auto industry built hopes in a growing middle class that society never quite fulfilled malcolm_x had whipped some into a frenzy of bitterness but spurred no action and then came stokely carmichael with his black_power in a year when congress reversed itself the dream of integration died during martin_luther_kings march in chicago africa its customs and hair styles became palatable and the momentum of the rights movement screeched to a halt now there is something on the scene called black nationalism and it is a search a state of mind a hardening conviction that whatever went before was inadequate the detroit challenge is how the middleclass negro is to keep the place that he has won while others find theirs theres lots of negro prosperity here but too many guys arent getting a piece of the action the chronicles managing editor a dunmore told a new york times reporter yet dunmores words are tame alongside those of slick campbell kaping kaping he fires at his audiences who always sit silently awaiting the inevitable fury damn fool dont you know thats freedoms ring recently a peoples tribunal was con vened by the citywide citizens action committee ccac at central united church of christ at the last moment the tribunal had to be moved from the dexter theatre because of pressure from the white power structure the executive board of central church came together immediately in a special session and unanimously granted the ccac permission to use its building the vote was taken after dan aldridge and lonnie peek cochairmen of the tribunal working under the legal department of ccac advised of the threats pressure and harassment which had been used to intimidate law yers witnesses and members of the committee central church officers stated quite simply we love our church and the building in which we worship but even if granting permission for the peoples tribunal to be held here means the destruction of our building as churches have been destroyed in birmingham and all over the south we still have no choice we serve the black messiah jesus of nazareth who came to unite and free an oppressed black nation our brothers have been brutally slain and it is only right that the voice of truth silent in the corrupt halls of justice should ring out in the house of god so the peoples tribunal was held under the soulful eyes of the beautiful black madonna the foot painting by detroit artist and ccac cochairman glanton dowdell which dominates the sanctuary of central church and still another miracle of the many miracles which have been performed by the black madonna since her unveiling last easter sunday came to pass fear was driven from the hearts and minds of black brothers and sisters the first miracle had occurred the day after the unveiling when glanton dowdell and general baker arrested in connection with last summers kercheval rebellion had received suspended sentences not only the officers of central church were touched by this strange fearlessness the witnesses despite warnings not to testify and innumerable other efforts at pressure and intimidation appeared and testified is it not peculiar that their testimony which the prosecutor had considered not worthy of use in the regular court was considered too dangerous for use before a black peoples tribunal for every lawyer who found an excuse not to appear two more volunteered members of the committee worked around the clock investigating and sifting evidence one member was forced to remove his telephone to stop threatening calls to his wife until the tribunal was actually under way the committee could not be sure that an injunction or some legal maneuver would not be used to block the hearing as had been done in to prevent the playing of a tape of officer speichers testimony in the cynthia scott murder on the very night of that meeting everybody involved had been served with an injunction the brothers and sisters dont know what fear is any more in spite of the last minute change of location they began to arrive at central church at pm to be sure of a seat by pm the sanctuary and fellowship hall were filled to capacity and people were still coming from everywhere more than people were in the building and others were outside trying to get in it was a beautiful tribute to those black young men whose lives were taken in senseless acts of police criminality there is no way to put down on paper the sheer horror of the recital of events by witness after witness it is hard to believe that such bestiality could exist in the world that a group of ordinary white men could so hate ordinary black men yet it is so we should have known it before from the days of slavery from the days of reconstruction from everything that has happened to us in this land of the free and home of the brave but always we have tried to forget to close our eyes to reality to pretend we should have known when systematic genocide was introduced in mississippi to kill innocent black men women and children who dared to demand constitutional rights reserved only for white men women and children we should have known when black boys were systematically drafted out of all proportion to our percentage in the population to die in vietnam we should have known it in a thousand ways and deep down within each of us we have known but we have been afraid to face the truth but fear is gone horror remains but fear is gone indecision may still exist there may be different ideas about what should be done but fear is gone as the witnesses testified the packed auditorium became more quiet than a courtroom each individual relived the horrible moments faced by three unknown black boys victims of nothing more profound than the hatred of white men who hated them because they were black as i listened and looked out at the crowd i could not help thinking of the paintings by jon lockard that hang in the lobby of the church i thought of the painting of the black messiah the strong black face under a crown of thorns suffering beaten humiliated but undefeated and when a mother cried at the witness story of the death of her son the indignities he faced the senseless cruelty of his dying i could see the picture of mary at the crucifixion i wonder if the crowd as it filed in orderly quiet through the church lobby and into the street saw in the tears on her black face the tears of black mothers in every generation who have seen the cruelty of oppression and its effects upon their sons and daughters but fear is gone mary may cry at the crucifixion but she is not afraid black men may be crucified but they are not afraid and in some strange new way we are forging a unity of the spirit which binds us together in love and in dedication to freedom thousands of people came together in testimony to this fearlessness and to this dedication we are living in a new day detroit is a new city and black people have a new spirit during this writers high school and college days in detroitin the forties and early fiftiesthe power structure through its spokesman the local daily press fastened onto one negro leader as the epitome of respectability and acceptability for the black community that man headed the local branch of a national service organization whenever there were signs of revolt out there on the west side or on the north end or especially down around paradise valley and environs the editorials rolled forth to admonish the blacks that they had it good and that they would do well to aspire to emulation of that esteemed leader who had found large sympathy in the white community and to prove how well considered their man was the power structure elected him for the umpteenth time to some position on some commission where he was the first negro he was wellrewarded for his services to the cause of the status quo this muchadmired negro leader was the most colorconscious man i have ever met black or white as a feature writer for the michigan chronicle in the fifties i once went to talk to him about the prospect of utilizing a section of his headquarters for meetings of a writers and theater group an idea whichto his credit appealed to him since he had some years earlier sponsored a similar group during the half hour or so of my interview this man amiably discussed people we knewor knew ofmutually invariably making some comment or description which referred to the individuals color people were light brown or very light or dark brown or deep tan or dark or quite dark or black or very black and it was very clear that people occupied niches in some hierarchical structure in his mind and affections according to the amount of melanin in their skins i never had occasion personally to go to the agency this man headed to seek help in the areas in which it functioned but i had friends who did some of them luckless people later complained that preference always seemed to go to the sons and daughters of socialites and that those favors which the agency was in a position to grant did not necessarily go to the most qualified candidate it was an old story needing no substantiation it is the way life is but not the way life has to be during those years in detroit society was the thing scarcely an edition of ebony magazine hit the streets without some gorgeous photographic coverage of a grand ball a grander debut or an even grander weekend at a country estate or private island if black people were denied jobs and refused service in downtown sandwich shops gerrymandered into substandard schools or routinely beaten up by the police these things were regrettablebut bearable after all there were edward turner and art johnson of the naacp to handle such matters and turner and johnson did what they could routinely over on detroits west side and up in pontiac some miles away a trio of young men were making noises against routine racial discrimination and the routine response to it the detroiter was albert b cleage jr pastor of a presbyterian church the other two were suburbanites milton henry an attorney and his kid brother richard they were troublemakers young cleage had a hassle with the bigwigs of his church and ended up by dressing them down the henry brothers kept the temperature hot around pontiac disturbing the peace in every area from housing to police methods and their enemies made appropriate trouble for them eventually members of the cleage family joined with members of the henry family and launched a newspaper designed to express the general dissatisfaction of detroitarea black people they also tried other publications all failed which is another sad commentary on black people not on the cleages and troublemakers stuck to ven in the dry years before the black revolution sparked down in north carolina and burned gradually northward they stuck to their guns and their targets were as often the apathetic socialites spreading the ghetto out through oakman boulevard and seven mile road the new gold coast the power structure labeled the troublemakers racists and the socialites naturally echoed the charge however something new had been added to the old scene the black revolution had liberated a lot of negroes turned them black and made it acceptable at last for black people to say what they always had thought they said it and to everyones surprise thousands of black folks out there in the ghetto responded by the time a brash young rebel named stokely carmichael exploded upon the scene black people had been aroused to their possibilities as never before and they no longer needed to pay homage to the socialites and to the leaders the power structure had selected for them in detroit the cleages and the henrys were joined by a string of talented and forwardlooking people with the new vision among them artist henri king artist glanton dowdell bookseller edward vaughn attorney andrew perdue james boyce alvin harrison william flowers and nadine brown an organization called forum came into being sponsored two successive black arts conventions see page and sparked a renaissance of blackoriented thought and activity spreading its influence across the nation the malcolm_x society a semisecret organization sprang into existence during the summer of the malcolmites made a list of demands on the inevitable commission named by the city administra tion to study the causes of the detroit rebellion the demands included governmental cooperation with community institutions in rebuilding and relocating houses and businesses the election by districts of city councilmen school board members and police commissioners neighborhood participation and veto rights in urban renewal projects a policy of compensatory employment of black people and compensation for all black people illegally arrested and inconvenienced during the rebellion a detailed plan for the redevelopment of the th street area center of devastation during the rebellion was drawn up by the malcolmite society rendered by artist henri king and presented to the newly formed community council and land cooperative the point welltaken and strongly emphasized that black people are going to decide how their communities are to be built and operated the comprehensive plan proposed the construction of a complex of low medium and highrise apartment buildings a series of recreational centers a small industries park compact shopping centers new schools and libraries a professional and business plaza a community theater a community art center parks playgrounds and a complex of single and multiple dwellings in the wake of the rebellion cleage and his cohorts joined with other concerned detroiters to form the citywide citizens action committee ccac an organization which through unifying the black community could serve as a lever in negotiations with the new detroit committee a similarly new organization representing the traditional power blocks within the greater community for all intents and purposes the black people who are directing the new organizations represent the new black establishment in detroit few of the old leaders are heard from the daily newspapers no longer seek to impose on the restive black community the leaders they have chosen and a new sense of pride and yes of power is clearly visible in the faces and in the voices of the ordinary black people the new black leaders have aroused a new kind of hope in detroit something happened to detroit it happened suddenly though not without prior warning it hapned with thorough tactical prossionalismthough apparently ithout leadership it happened by visible people whom even negroes generally did not know or recognize this something happened to the city and the whole city while all of the citizensnegro and white were baffled and unbelieving spectators upon their own paralysis before it is over it will have cost the citizens possibly lives and over million dollars in looted vandalized and burned business establishmentsand in burned and gutted homes and apartments an even greater cost will be the sudden sacrifice of the justified and still justifiablereputation of this city as being the only city among all the major cities of the whole nation which has taken as many creative initiatives in human and community relations and which has built as many strong bonds of interracial and interfaith coalitions it is the one major city which escaped such violence for a quarter of a century it still is farthest along in the establishment of a genuinely viable democratic community where almost everybody has a meaningful role in the total enterprise of community life that is everybody except the totally alienated what happened had no clearly enunciated rationale and none has yet come forth from any participant or spokesman it had no identifiable leadership yet it happened suddenly swiftly sweepingly apparently without need of these although the phrase race riot was used by communications media for lack of better terminology it was clear even to the news media that this was neither a race riot nor a racial demonstration in any previous sense of that phrase or by any parallel with any events of the past decade yet it also could not be characterized as a rebellion or an insurrection by reference to any present experience this is because too few are acquainted with negro historyand particularly with the early revolts of both slave negroes and white identured servants it takes this special knowledge of american history to see the precedents in connection with previous demonstrations and riots we are accustomed to seeing the buildup of overt hostilities and to witnessing eloquent appeals of spokesmen being denied or ignored before the main event there was none of this prelude moreover the acts of vandalism then burning and then sniping generated neither ethnic political civil_rights moral nor social rationale to sustain them yet they were sustained one most baffling fact is that no apparent and certainly no sustained hostilities were aimed at either groups or persons other than those specifically charged with authority to restore order or to quell fires there was no person against person fights no gangs chasing either negro or white persons no racial encountersand no general diminution of interracial communication and social intercourse at any level in the community if anything one became suddenly conscious of a heightened degree of interracial cooperation throughout the community this costly tragicomedy defies even symbolic association with the racial epithets of the black_power clique it is strictly a negative power demonstration by the alien within our midst that alien has racial symbolism but no race we are yet to clearly understand this the phrase black_power which cropped up early and disappeared of its own inappropriateness really had no emotional force in an atmosphere of interracial looting interracial vandalism interracial incindiarism and interracial sniping except for the location of the initial incidents the event cannot even be described geographically as a ghetto phenomenon so quickly did it travel from the ghetto to the avenue of fashions and the boulevards of luxury establishments even that move was highly selective in targets the important thing is that within the initial target area and before the spreading flames took their own toll as a result of firemen being hampered the targets were exclusively business establishmentsand those were selected as though on a predetermined schema moreover the thoroughness of the selection and the completeness of the destruction of so many business establishments in so widely scattered parts of the city in so short a time had all of the earmarks of professionalism well rehearsed timing and even tactical preplanning yet supposedly no professional leaders were evident in any overt identification in fact no leaders or leadership types were evident equally important there were no acts of violence directed agains any private persons or racial groups as such during the entire course of events there were none of the chasings beatings gang attacks or killings of private persons such as characterized the detroit race riot of or the many subsequent demonstrations and riots elsewhere throughout the nation that we have witnessed since in no sense was there persontoperson hostility on the contrary there were constant and paradoxical observations of a peculiar sort of quasihumorous circus atmosphere like the annual student riots at fort lauderdale floridabut different in addition there was the specific absence of any gang patterns even among the snipersprobably the most astounding and foreboding fact is that better than per cent of the entire population of this metropolis was caught completely unaware of such a possibility even as it was occurring the few prior scattered weekend events with definite racial overtones on three or four successive weekends were handled by due process of law and were accepted by the community on the merit of that process but those events did not involve the completely alienated when this event struck upon us with all of its costly and devastating fury its participants were not recognizable to any of the more than human relations civic religious protest and even extreme protest groups which have been vocal and active on social issues in detroit nor did they enlist the support or participation of any of these groups or organizations in any cause that they represented as the looting and vandalism progressed for in truth they did not represent a cause they represented a fact what then is this fact this fact is that the elusive they have many highly developed skills which the national society even in the best city in the nation will pay a dearer price for not using or for turning into expert destroyers rather than training them and using them constructively we must not fail to see the symbolism in the simple fact that a blind pig raid provided the generating spark so long as we continue to force a choice upon those who are alienated which tells them that they can in factfind a more lucrative life and more peergroup acceptance by engagement in illegal than in legal activity so long as the school dropout cannot find acceptance among any respected and legitimate employers and so long as he knows that even if he does that employer will not be able to compete in wages and personal fringe benefits with the illegal business enterprise then so long will it be a basic pragmatic and attractive choicethe same kind of choice made by the other per cent of americans to adopt willie suttons law and go where the money is but once gone and once in the pattern of seeking success through that route his powers must then be developed refined and utilized by such as will hire and use them for illegal activity so we had better start our route to repair by clearly distinguishing in our own mind between the notpoorbyincome poor criminal and illegal operators from the real poor for it is evident that their chief victim is the poor we also must separate in our own minds those who are clearly bent upon the destruction of our society from legitimate civil_rights activists for it is evident that the formers goals are completely incompatible with the existence of a community in which civil_rights has any meaning in this connection we had better begin to be much more discriminating and sensiblein the national interestabout who is characterized as a negro leader a destroyer is not a leader except to destruction it is imperative that negro or whitewe distinguish between negro leaders and both negro and white destroyers we also must not be too quick to label a product which we have massproduced in our own communitys educational social and economic system a criminal as though that ends the problem that is where the problem begins we produced them their values ar our values their wants are our wants but our good life is not their good life and our belonging is not their belonging since they do not have open and constructive routes to the achievement of these our avenues are not their avenues to the enjoyment of the things we take for granted and they demand either to have these things or to see us pay a terrible toll for their being so denied this is their plain economic pragmatism moreover the wider the gap between the affluent and the alienated the narrower the perimeters for choice either way become and by the fact the more closely does any community approach the prospect of recurring violence this we can never afford and survive so now we have a different kind of confrontation than has appeared before in recent history for this was a revolt a revolt differs from demonstrations as we know them from riots as we know them and even from insurrections for all of these latter are overt in both leadership and design revolts are covert devastating and sudden not since the gabriel prosser and nat turner revolts of the nineteenth century have we seen this phenomena several commentators made the mistaken comment that this was the biggest riot in american his tory they were far from righton two scores this was not a riot and it is not the most costly even in detroit history in human lives the faulkner riot perpetrated by white persons in march cost more lives and proportionately more property finally we have become so accustomed to our social concerns about those who are segregated from the mainstream of society that we just have not developed the social instruments and programs to really enfold those who are alienated from the total society now even in this most progressive city of detroitthey have got around to us and when they got to us we had no readymade racial answers because they are both negro and white we had no economic palliatives because they are not among the organized and visible poor we had no moral response because the morality of nonviolence has not brought to them the rewards it brought to us we had no community response because when we have seen them they were in but not of the community moreover it must give a peculiar satisfaction to a person who has been denied induction into the military service to see himself pinning down soldiers for minutes with sniper fire in his own private warand then escape never forget no matter how strong we are in our bonds of community and no matter how con cemed we are for the continued health and growth of our city the alienated are not the same as the segregated the segregated are part of the society itself nothing in the recent history of demonstrations and even riots is comparable to the revolts of the alienated so such attempts at analogues will be futile we must go all the way back then and study the dynamics of early revolts to learn what the present events in detroit and elsewhere have been about and when we study them we should find that the rebellious slaves and indentured servants shared these three things in commona concealed but deep resentment in their consciousness of complete alienation an unswerving desire for the better things they saw around them and a devastating capability for sudden destructive and seemingly unorganized revolts against authority for those who have continually demeaned these people and argued that the community and the nation should not make the extra effort to reach them should not make the extra investment in their more realistic education training and selfimage building should not make a larger investment in their adjustment to the constructive and legitimate job market should not be concerned about the investment in and reorientation of services for their health family and environmental improvement should not expand upon the programmed efforts at finding with them a place of belonging and respect and personal dignity in our community and in our society whatever this cost in lives property community pride and fear of swift destruction from sources unknown is only part of the price that we must continue to pay for not doing so with the recent superimposition of the theory of violence upon the formerly nonviolent moral thesis of the civil_rights movement even detroit has not been good enough or strong enough to be spared if it can happen in detroit it will happen anywhere else in this nation however if we bring to bear upon this community after this shock the same constructive and creative resolutions which have carried us through years before we shall find a way to open up alternatives to them that will both spare us and embrace them and that better voice of detroit will be heard again in our land the new chairman of sncc h rap brown daniel watts editor of liberator mrs betty shabazz charles p howard and the reverend albert l cleage were speakers at the opening session of the second black arts convention sponsored by edward vaughns forum in detroit june and july and that was prior to the detroit rebellion sessions were held in rev cleages central united church we didnt make the laws why should we obey them brown asked change your color and then your power will change mrs shabazz the widow of brother malcolm spoke briefly on unity citing the unity of the jews in the suez crisis the reverend cleage said meetings like this would always be welcome in his church howard said we can change the system only through black_power he defined the black mans enemies as big business big labor the church and some civil_rights lead ers watts said that the white mans freedom is the freedom to exploit when we cry freedom with our warmth the white man doesnt understand us there is no dialogue he said blacks did not need a separate state that there are laws providing for local areas to part from governing bodies and form their own governments june was devoted to a youth conference and july was given over to panels and workshops in the panel on religion islam and the yoruba religions but not the christian religion were represented when moderator milton henry asked what could be abstracted from the different values henry wells said neither islam nor christianity are effective he urged the conferences to forget individualism and to accept collectivism drew ali bey and b i bey advised the panel to work together on what is good in a religion not to concentrate on its faults the yoruba spokesman said the arabians were notorious slave traders and advised using the native yoruba religion as a base and traditional beliefs as a guide to government in the panel on literature rhobena nelson stressed the need of selfknowledge and selfidentity francis ward associate editor of ebony said the responsibilities of the black writer were to devote himself to the struggle for equality and freedom to give leadership through his writing to discover and promulgate black history and to interpret the condition of the peopie the black writer may have to be both writer and activist ward said adding that since he knows his own life best he may start from there then later write on larger areas the black writer doesnt have to leave such questions as love hate and war to white writers ward said he suggested that there is a fine line between art and propaganda leroi jones writes on black problems but has literary skills and is a genuine artist bobb hamilton poet artist and eastcoast editor of soulbook went further into wards ideas he said that literature communicates emotions and analyzes and criticizes events it can destroy and that is not bad and should be done hamilton said he added literature is inseparable from the life of the people black literature was destroyed although negroes are trained in engineering and economics these have no cohesion literature is as important as religion it forms a people dudley randall poet and publisher said that the themes of writers conferences had been first the role of the black writer then the black audience and the trend of opinions was that the writer should write as a black man and to and for the black audience we are a nation of twenty million and could support a flourishing literature he proposed a national book council sponsoring a national book week and an organization to promote the creation and distribution of literature and to disseminate information about literature later a group of writers and editors met and listed what each wanted and what each could provide amer rashid and ahmad malik shabazz who said he was the first black man to enter rice university read their poems shabazz said a new breed of poet was coming out who went deeper than surfaces and caused the reader to go deeper they used the art of leroi jones images symbols rhythms without rimes line endings and split lines to suggest their meanings instead of direct presentation in the panel on racism in education arthur reese said that americas schools were racist from the beginning many teachers have provincial parochialism and criticize a students grammar and ignore his meaning reese said the teachers not the students are culturally deprived as they cant communicate with their students he suggested teachers say black history should be integrated but how can you integrate truth with myths reese asked how can you teach that thomas jefferson was a hero when he was a slavemaster the solution is not to put black teachers in black classrooms for many of them are white with black skins the solution is to force schools to teach as they should david llorens assistant editor of ebony said the quality of education must be improved american schools are for training not for educating james baldwin richard wright and malcolm_x taught me more sociology than anyone ive ever come in contact with it is essential that black people control schools in their neighborhoods llorens stated a teacher who understands stravinsky but not james brown shouldnt be teaching black children he said the american educational system teaches you that the white man is humane and therefore you cant believe america supports haiti south africa and similar regimes a mother mrs helen kelley related a problem she had with a sudden change in her daughters program causing her to spend fifty dollars more for books she said parents have to stay in the schools and demand their rights in the panel on art charles enochs statement that art must communicate and serve the purpose of the movement was challenged by henri king who said he didnt go along with the idea of being used he was against social editorializing and artists making themselves hacks painting black christs and malcolm_xs this was only imitating king insisted the role of the black artist is to create something new and dynamic to destroy everything in art today and replace it with something new he has created king said he also warned that using african art is commercial as it wasnt created for fine art harold neal disagreed saying that artists must stop being a specialist and must be like any other black man fighting for his freedom he didnt go along with tired white boys who introduce a series of dots one year and are hailed by critics who have to find something new king said that black artists have not created their own art form that black musicians have enoch agreed that black people have no soul art that can be looked at and called soul art neal said that no black painters have responded to the murder of medgar evers or to the bombing of the four girls in birmingham on july the delegates voted that each should send a letter to howard university protesting the firing of dr nathan hare and other professors and the expulsion of activist students and that forum should send a telegram of protest to the university and one to dr hare supporting his efforts edward vaughn asked all organizations to forget differences of ideology and to form a national liberation front within the black arts confederation of unity dudley randall presented mrs betty shabazz with a copy of the memorial volume of poems for malcolm_x titled for malcolm which was signed by all the poets in the book in attendance at the convention joyce whitsitt and le graham included in the book read poems on july there was a parade and the convention concluded with a speech by dr vincent harding of spelman college on the gift of blackness he said that black people have a beautiful heritage some may want to put down part of it but the whole heritage has beauty and can help us to obtain our freedom he said he praised the beauty and the poetry of the spirituals the afroamerican can change things and he must not forego the spiritual aspect dr harding warned the national foundation on the arts and the humanities under pressure has added four negro magazines to the list of more than which are consulted for material for the american literary anthology annuals the four magazines are phylon freedomways black dialog and soulbook for those readers who are not familiar with the whole flap involving the national foundations american literary anthology and negro magazines here is a brief rundown the national foundation in granted for the publishing of an anthology of literature compiled from the little magazines published in this country by little magazines the foundation had in mind those independent and universitybased publications dedicated to bringing out the literary works of writers of talent who have not yet received recognition by the literary establishment there are as the number cited above illustrates quite a lot of these magazines some of them appear for only an issue or two and then fold and so there are always new ones on the scene what the foundation proposed to do in its annual american literary anthology was to select from these magazines the best of the poems stories criticism sketches and essays publish this work and then generously reward the authors and editors each poet whose work was selected would receive a gargantuan sum when it is recognized that most of the little magazines can afford to pay nothing at all authors of stories and essays would receive the editors who originally selected the work also would be rewarded handsomely to preside over this project the foundation chose george plimpton a rich society dilettante who has written several books a committee of established writers all white was named to judge the material these writers were robert creeley and john ashberry for poetry walker percy and william styron both southerners for fiction and robert brustein john thompson and benjamin de mott for criticism a year ago negro digest contributor william barrow wrote to carolyn kizer director of literary programs for the national foundation on the arts and the humanities informing her that as the project was conceived negro writers would be excluded from participation in it mr barrow explained that the racial realities being what they are few negro writers ever are published in the little magazines he proposed that the people involved with the anthology therefore had the responsibility of seeking those publications which welcomed the work of negro writers he named negro digest among other magazines miss kizers reply to mr barrow was lofty in the extreme she implied that the magazines listed did not qualify as little and did not emphasize literary content and furthermore that it would be counter to the law to give special consideration to negro writers the thrust of her argument was that if negro writers were not represented in the conventional little magazines then tough barrows argument and received pretty much the same response from washington there was not even a suggestion that the foundation might relent and consider negro magazines even though negro digest submitted a list which included liberator soulbook black dialog and freedomways however negro digest had decided not to allow the foundation people to ignore black people so cavalierly pressure was mounted articles appeared in negro digest and finally when no satisfaction from the foundation was forthcoming letters were dispatched to the offices of all the negro congressmen that brought a response toward the end of august a letter arrived from the foundation signed with the name of roger l stevens the top man stating that freedomways black dialog soulbook and phylon had been added to the list of more than magazines from which material is culled for the anthologies the liberator and negro digest were not included because it was felt that the material which they contain is not primarily literary any more than the work of magazines such as the nation and the new republic well negro digest still feels that black writers are getting shafted in this deal but the fight is in the open some concessions have been made and others can now take up arms if they feel it important enough the first anthology will be published by farrar straus and giroux in the spring and has been set aside this year for the second anthology to be published a year later throughout all this flap with the foundation an important fact has emerged it is simply that the black establishment writersthe writers acceptable to whites but usually considered irrelevant to the negro cause are being used as consultants by the white people at the foundation that being the case it is to be expected that those black writers will be favored who embrace the artforartssake approach to writing incidentally saunders redding former professor of literature at hampton institute and author of several books including a new novel is the top negro at the foundation he is director of the division of research and publication in the august issue of redbook magazine jean wheeler smith spoke to the hundreds of thousands of middleclass white women who read that publication eloquently stating how and why she learned to feel black it is a beautifully simple and straightforward piece of writing mrs smith negro digest readers will know is the lovely detroitborn girl who left her studies at howard university and went off to the southern wars with that valiant band of young sncc workers in that seems in the early fall of a lifetime ago well she labored faithfully finally returned to howard for her degree married frank smith a fellowsncc worker and settled in mississippi to carry on the fight and to try to make a life all this is told in the redbook article but it is background to the core of jean wheeler smiths message in i learned to feel black the young lady traces her personal development ernest j gaines can write rings around dozens of american novelists with far more glittering reputations a quiet serious young man with no apparent passion for selfpromotion he has not forced himself upon the public stage where so many contemporary writers are busy gilding their eminence in when his first novel catherine carmier was published not even his publishers atheneum seemed inclined to provide him with that necessary public relations push which would have brought the novel a share of the attention it deserved for catherine carmier without question was one of the finest novels of that season in a notice of the book in negro digest the reviewer termed mr gaines a writer with artistry in his touch he has the gift of perception and an affinity for that truth which is larger than the lives he creates in several stories published subsequently in literary magazines and later collected in anthologies mr gaines artistic touch has remained sure the stories like catherine carmier have been concerned with the lives of ordinary people black and white and inbetween in the rural louisiana of the authors own beginnings the inbetween is important in this context for the complex legacy of several interrelated traditions and institutionsslavery the french language and culture and creole societyremains strong and viable in the land of the bayous and yet author gaines is concerned with these traditions and institutions only insofar as they establish a frame of reference for his themes stated gen erally these themes revolve around the conflict of eras the new world of mobility and expanded possibilities impinges on the old world of landlove and solid accepted social stratification the old realities of the plantation culture gradually surrender to the demands of industrial pace and technology the oncerigid poles which separated ruling whites from cajun and cajun from mulatto and mulatto from black have been bent all out of shape mr gaines describes human beings caught up unwittingly and often unwillinglyin a quiet and inexorable revolution and there are subordinate themes in the sky is gray one of the authors first pubished stories a painfully poor black mother by a single act of simple pride teaches her young son and demonstrates to whites who would patronize her the great dignity inherent in the human soul in a long day in november another of mr gaines long lyrical short stories full of the nutty flavor of rural southern life a sixvearold mt boy watches his tormented father savage his honorand his marriage in a day of gentle but terribe crisis in catherine carmier a cofieeveducated young man returns from california to the ancient greataunt who adores him knowing that he must shatter her hopes by informing her that he never again can share with her the old values and customs of his childhood in his new novel of hove and dust published under the banner of a different house dial mr gaines combines all these themes weaving them into a subtle literary tapestry which no amount of sensational writing or sociologizing can equal of love and dust set in tells the story of a brash young louisianans headlong journey to doom marcus a handsome irrepressible rogue has murdered a rival in a knife fight in a baton rouge tavern andon the plea of the noble old woman who reared himhas been placed in the custody of marshall hebert owner of a vast plantation a still viable remnant of southern feudalism hebert represents power he is a law unto himself and at his word marcus can be either sentenced to prison or set free pending his trial marcus is put to work in the fields with sidney bonbon a harddriving cajun as his overseer bonbons task is to break the spirit of the arrogant marcus a job he undertakes with accustomed relish but the citybred marcus is not so easily subdued though brutalized by the tedious work he remains unbowed not only that but he succeeds in scandalizing the black people on the plantation by his uninhibited womanizing fully knowing the danger he nevertheless courts pauline the beautiful black woman who is the overseers lover failing at that he stakes out an even more dangerous prey he decides to seduce his overseers childlike wife louise one of those pale creatures left loveless in the big house while her man is off tumbling in the sack with black servant women marcus daring leads inevitably to disaster this simple outline of the story cannot convey the texture or the depth of the humanity with which if is told all the characters are vibrantly alive they have been clearly and truly seen and all the intricate relationships and undercurrents which characterize the pattern of existence in rural louisana are traced with skill and certainty aspects of the story are classic the white master with his black concubine and the mulatto children he cannot legally claim the myriad black servants and retainers profoundly wise in their subservience a greek chorus in blackface the murderous secrets which propel the corrupt overlords toward still more murder and degeneracy and yet none of this familiar material is treated with banality marcus story is told by jim kelly in his own language the simple unadorned language of an intelligent if uneducated black man of honor jim is a tractor driver on the plantation an unbonded worker and the man who would be marcus friend like all the other black people on the plantation jim at first finds marcus overbearing and despicable a man totally lacking in humility and humanity but later as fate catches up with marcus jim makes a telling discovery he finds that it is his own fear of breaking the old taboos of claiming his own manhood which made him fear and hate marcus he begins to see marcus less as a villain than as an emergent hero he begins to understand that marcus violent and dangerous behavior grew out of marcus refusal to submit to rules of living which violated his manhood marcus jim learns at last was a man of honor and integrity in the fashion he had adopted for himself because he could not accept the pattern that had been imposed upon him when jim first learns of marcus fantastic plan to escape from the plantation with louise whom he has awakened to life jim feels that marcus has gone mad but gradually realizing that marcus could have gone off alone to safety rather than risk everything by taking the woman along jim sees that marcus has begun the climb upward from the armor of inhumanity with which his bitterness had clothed him marcus act of love has reclaimed him in the end jim leaves the plantation knowing himself a better man because of marcus it is not possible given the elements of the story that of love and dust will find the popular audience it deserves because the novel deals honestly and from a black viewpoint with the commonplace but nonetheless delicate sexual relationships prevalent in the bayou country it will bemust beeither downgraded or dismissed by the critics whywriting in a recent issue of negro digest ottilie markholt explained the critics can acexcept long suffering oppressed negroes who may be pitied she said but they cannot accept strong free black people who know they are morally superior to whites but neglect of this novel will be a crime against literature the critics keep crying for good novels and they keep ignoring them when they appearif the novels do not say what the critics want to hear in the way the critics want it saidhoyt john oliver killens sippi trident press has been heralded as his most ambitious novel after reading all pages of this novel i decided that mr killens first line in this classically bad novel should have been once upon a time there was a fair white golden haired maiden who lived in the big house on the hill and a handsome black boy who lived in a shack down in the valley on the girls fathers plantation everyone knows the story by heart naturally the goldenhaired one and the little black boy are going to meet in the woods the bedroom the tree the cave or wherever and fondle each other innocent sex play but in mixed hue this is the beginning of what proves to be a series of deadly plodding events that all lead nowhere the black boy goes to college in the south white girl goes to school in the north and falls into an integrated group of bland clicheplagued middleclass negroes who talk as though theyve been expertly programmed to blare their class times and color black boy and white girl make it in new york black boy has been making it all along with an older woman in college town a kind of growing up white in black skin or something meanwhile down in sippi civil_rights is the thing white folks find out that black folks have changed black folks find out black folks have changed little black boy goes back to mississippi to find himself and become a part of movement some people are killed and black boy realizes that hes colored too and joins the elders all the characters move through sippi in two dimensional sleepwalkers stupor saying things that are expected of them in light of the plot and message they just dont come to life these shadowy people are used as good propaganda foils now there is nothing wrong with this kind of polemic it just is not a novel i find it impossible to say anymore about this novel do not object to the theme the people the locale i find that it is not art we know nothing more about the people the situation and the past or present than could be casually picked up from reading the new york times perhaps the fault is that there are too many writers who have not learned that there is nothing so deadly as the stereotypical southern racial conflict southern sexual dilemmas and southern myths which give us nothing more than southern racial conflicts southern sexual dilemmas and southern myths whether white or black these writers had better move beyond the history books and the present psychological lore and tell us something about our dreams nightmares and partial consciousness and in so doing engage our total being in this experience as painful or joyous as it may be to do less is not a sin it just is not artronald williams saunders redding has written a book called the negro potomac books in which he says among other similar things the following negro writersincluding poets playwrights and novelistsconsider themselves spokesmen for their people in the s and s the best of them were speaking more clearly and were listened to more attentively than ever before richard wright was one of the first of these but wright moved permanently to france in and lost touch with the living reality of america italics the reviewers the passage might have been written by any number of removed white critics referring to the new negro selfimage mr redding credits the american press and indeed all the media of mass communication with reacting to this image responsibly italics the reviewers apparently mr redding is familiar with an american press and a mass communication media which manages to elude most of the rest of us but that kind of statement is rather general throughout this little book less than pages of text which could not have been conceived for the consumption of black people in any case this is not a harsh judgment writing of the widely publicized fracas at the united nations following the murder in the congo of patrice lumumba mr redding says the following blaming all the worlds troubles on american imperialism and the white mans inborn perfidy and pretending to see this nations connivance in the murder of patrice lumumba the first premier of independent congo a rabble of these extremists staged a riot in the un that interrupted ambassador adlai stevensons first speech to the general assembly italics the reviewers it sort of speaks volumes for itself volumes mr redding never intended to peak mr redding by the way is a government man currently director of the division of research and publication for the national endowment for the humanities the negro is one of seven books in the publishers the usa survey serieshoyt w fuller on august m b tolson died jean toomer died in april and the next month marked the death of langston hughes all three of these poets were writing during the negro renaissance of the nineteen twenties jean toomers cane published in was one of the best and earliest of the books of the negro renaissance it had a great influence on emerging writers causing them to write unabashed and unashamed of the negro as they found him even today in the recently published anger and beyond toomer is referred to again and again showing that he is still influencing todays writers tolsons first book rendezvous with america was not published until in it he showed great erudition a concern with history and a mastery of varied poetic forms his libretto for the republic of liberia and harlem gallery showed a mastery of the complex and sometimes obscure poetic idiom of the modern academic school although admired he has not had many imitators or followers langston hughes was one of the earliest and most prolific of the renaissance poets he continued writing almost until his death pouring forth a stream of poems novels plays biographical historical and humorous works many negro writers have been influenced by his humor his choice of racial themes his artlessappearing free verse or his variations or syncopations on traditional forms like the ballad stanza or the couplet all of these men will be remembered most of their poetic contemporaries including claude mckay and countee cullen are dead or are silent in poetry like arna bontemps or almost silent like sterling brown who will take their place one looks to the next generation of poets those of the forties robert hayden and gwendolyn brooks are the most meticulous craftsmen margaret danner has recently published poem counterpoem margaret walker pours forth her verse in a fluent mass but she seldom publishes frank marshall davis and owen dodson have long been silent m carl holman and gloria oden seldom publish one also looks at the newest generation of poets its outstanding member is the fiery leroi jones originally writing in the obscure greenwich village idiom his recent identification with the black masses has caused him to write with more clarity and force there seems to be another renaissance of black poetry taking place today but the loss of these three giants has left a great void who will fill it support your los cal police the g bumper sticker read vs and i should have known better from the way he slowed in front of me before he got to the toll gate and from his hesitation and his annoyed ahhh the hell with it gesture that he gave me crouched over from the cold but i should have known not to relax as i ran up behind the car after it stopped my eyes on that bumper sticker support your local police but then the harrisburg exit of the pennsylvania turnpike seemed a gateway to

with us colored people all across the country for them wonderful lifetime jobs i tell these stories with a straight face and sometimes talk so much about patsy mae that the more brainy of my

except that theres a lot of stories to hear and see between here and there jason jerked his hand it back into the cell in another second it would have been crushed by the heavy steel door licking his burned finstared incredulously through the bars at the obese guard why did you do that he demanded what you know put that cigar out on my hand oh that drawled the guard i just wanted you to move it sos i could shut the door jason was so angry he could hardly see he could focus only on the guards huge neck bulging from a grey collar on which was stamped mississippi state penitentiary he longed to grab the red splotched neck to squeeze it until the network of blue veins stood out like railroad tracks but he was out of reach he banged his good hand against the bars but realizing the futility of his anger he turned away from the guard to face the other fellows who had been packed into the tiny cell with him a few filled the space around the toilet the others stood cramped between the two steel bunks in the dim light he squinted his eyes searching for chenault he would know what to do chenault was lowering himself onto a bottom bunk his face brown and lightly freckled was rigidly set jason had known him for five years since they had been seniors together in college they had worked together and slept in the same room but he had never seen chenault so tense maybe jason thought chenaults worried about the others who were arrested with us during the demonstration smart of those cops to pick us out as the organizers and bring us up here to the state farm left all the other demonstrators in the big compound nobody left to work with them hope theyll be alright willie c a tall thin boy in overalls broke the silence chenault ben say the guard told him he was gonna take all us clothes away say he be back to get them after he finish his dinner what must we do i dont feel right without my pants on i dont want to give up my clothes the others crowded together on the bunks and began to argue over what to do jason spoke up over the noise of course i want to hear what chenault has to say first but i think we ought to go along with what the guard tells us we dont know how long well be in here before the office can get up the bond money but its gonna take a long time to raise you saw what just happened to my hand obviously these guards can do anything to us they want and nobodyll know about it til its too late lets give them the clothes willie c whined chenault what you think we must do im scared shut up willie ben shouted you sound foolish chenault aint no more than anybody else in here just cause he talk bout concepts and such dont mean he know better than me or you what to do bout these crackers stop begging him to tell you what to do and think for yourself ben sprang to the floor and strode the twostep limit to the wall of the cramped cell he was a short paunchy black man whose age was somewhere between inserting his thumbs in the bib of his blue overalls he said now i think what jason said was wrong he just got to mississippi a month ago aint been in jail a time in his life before now and he gonna tell us how to act i know these crackers and if we start giving in now theyll keep pushing us harder and harder to see how much crap they can make us eat taking our clothes just the first thing they gonna do to break us down and show that they the boss man here jason looked to see chenaults reaction to the problem of the clothes he sat quietly staring impassively at the huge door why doesnt chenault say something certainly he knows tluit this first decision is critical we have to stick together have to react in a unified way it was chenaults practice to encourage everyone to speak to draw out the opinions of the less vocal and then to come up with a plan which reflected the feelings of everyone this plan was usually accepted immediately and with a sigh of relief but now he didnt seem to be listening jason willed him to pay attention come on man get on the ball this is important we got to face that guard chenault remained quiet lifting his head to listen only when ben spoke jason knew that chenault gave special weight to bens opinions since they usually reflected the opinions of the other local mississippi people who worked with the movement and everyone in the cell except jason and chenault was local people but maybe it wasnt so bad if chenault wasnt listening to the others it probably meant that he had heard his own decision in what the others were saying and he was checking himself against bens words after a half hour of argument someone asked chenault what you think we should do chenault pulled his glasses down on his face and leaned forward he spoke so softly that twice his voice was obscured by the flushing of the toilet i think what people are saying is that we have to show the guards were not afraid of them and yet keep them from shooting one of us to do this we have to agree in advance on what things well do and what we wont like whether well work in the cotton fields for them that way were setting our own terms for our existence here and as long as we know that the guards havent broken down our terms were still winning ben interrupted come on chenault get off that theoretical crap and make your point its getting late and that guard be back in a little while do yo uthink we ought to let him have the goddam clothes or not chenault grinned at bens reprimand ok man i got carried away i think we should give him the clothes cause he got the jump on us he made a demand that we werent ready for lets give up the clothes but also lets decide right now on what were going to do while were here so well be ready next time whew thats right give him the clothes and live to fight another day they agreed to give up all their clothes except their shorts there were some halfhearted jokes about chenault who didnt wear underwear and a final agreement that he should keep his pants they also agreed on what they would do if the guard tried to take chenaults pants from him jason stacked the clothes near him at the front of the cell and then rejoined the discussion on how they would conduct themselves while they were in jail they decided that they would not work in the prisons cottonfields that they would not let themselves be separated for any reason and that they would have only the necessary communication with the guards ah thats better firmer ground we know what were going to do still such a depressing place though cant even see anything through that little window up there blocked by a tree jason relaxed onto the bunk and rested his head against the stone wall from here he was the first to see the dull grey uniform of the guard who was bellowing something about handing over the damn clothes why the clothes are right down here cant he see them oh that vain mothagraber cant see anything cause hes watching his own shadow must get a kick out of digging the outlines of his power the shape of his gun and the lines of his billystick next thing you knew hell be cracking that whip in the air like a damn lion tamer finally the guard dragged his eyes away from his shadow and into the cell his glance bounced off jasons naked chest and down to the pile of clothes his mouth contorted into a smile so you niggers decided to act like you got some sense thats good cause i aint gonna take no crap off you your white friends aint here to help you now better get in your mind that you dont run this place i do now gimme them clothes and he reached his hand into the cell jason jumped back offended by the moist mealy texture of the guards hairy arm as it brushed past him when no one offered up the clothes the guard just stood there grinding on his cigar and shifting his eyes back and forth between the clothes and the naked prisoners as his eyes became accustomed to the darkness he recognized that chenault still wore his pants withdrawing his arm and pulling his pants up over his stomach he shifted his weight so that he faced chenault nigger you think you better than the others or something i said for you to take off them clothes chenault answered quietly we agreed that since i didnt have on any underwear i should keep the pants well it aint my fault if you dont know how to dress looks like i gotta take them pants off you as he unlocked the door and entered chenault and the others locked arms to form a chain roughly stepping on jason and the others near the door the guard tried to get in close to chenault muttering curses he tore at chenaults pants legs pulling his feet out and suspending him in the airjason tightened his grip on the arms of the fellows next to him burn me will you well you wont win this time you aint getting those pants for several minutes the guard pulled at chenault and the prisoners pulled back all the while kicking at the guard when it became obvious that the guard would not remove the pants singlehandedly the prisoners began to laugh and to sing the guard continued the tugowar from time to time he would drop the bottom half of chenault onto the bunk and try to attack the prisoners with his whip but the cell was too cramped and the space between the bunks too narrow for the whip to have any effect the pulling and kicking and singing continued until jason heard laughter from outside the cell he looked out and saw two other guards they were covering their laughter with looks of mock solemnity need some help in there joe one asked the guard threw chenault back up against the wall and wordlessly made his way out of the cell when i need your help mothagrabers ill call you he said to the other guards and stomped out of the cell block c c they slept that night on the steel bunks and concrete floor without benefit of mattress or cover each was awakened in the winter night by the extreme cold the guard had turned on the large fans in the wall when he left the cell block the next morning jason heard a great clamor he opened his eyes to find the guard banging on the bars with his club behind him a black trusty was standing holding an armload of striped clothing get your asses up time to go to work here some clothes for you to put on hope you wasnt cold last night were not going to work for you chenault answered as the guard digested this news jason observed a violent purple color rise up his neck by the time the purple reached earlevel it seemed the guard would explode he belched out one great stinking burst of air and with obvious effort reigned himself in alright he muttered through clenched teeth dont work but if you dont work you dont eat you wont last long you be begging me to let you work and he marched off with the trusty behind him this time he turned on the heat as he left the cell block along with the others jason tried to recover the position in which he had finally been able to get to sleep during the night his limbs felt as if they would never come straight again might as well twist myself back up between willie c and these bars maybe get another hour of sleep before the heat builds up but chenault would not let them go back to sleep he sprang up and went briskly to the commode relieved himself and rinsed his face in the wash basin as he washed he called out alright fellas cant let this place get to us you can go back to sleep later if you want to but at least get up in the morning he then went throughout the cell coaxing each fellow up and over to the wash basin he got some of them to do exercises with him they did pushups and climbed up the bars yodeling at the top like tarzan and yelling back insults to those who laughed at their physiques then chenault organized a game in which each man gave a lesson to the others in what he knew best they had a high school biology lesson and instruction on how to drink threefifths of whisky without getting sick for jasons benefit there was a demonstration on how to plow a mule in turn jason described advanced techniques for shoveling snow but despite their diversions the full force of the heating system made itself felt the cell became stifling and the only relief was the rush of air which came from flushing the toilet around eleven oclock although it seemed to jason that it must be evening the guard returned getting kinda hot in there maybe you all should come outside to the field cooler out there no one answered but out of the comer of his eye jason saw willie c lightly nodding his head seeming to agree with the guard the guard noticed this too and centered his attention on willie you mighty young to be in here with these bad niggers boy you traveling in company that gonna get you in real trouble why dont you come on out and work some wont give you no hard job let you be the water boy here have a cigarette jason stared in miserable fascination as the cigarette was proferred when willie reached out his hand jason spoke up dont take it willie we agreed we wouldnt have anything to do with these guards the guard smiled at the rift you gonna let this new york nigger tell you what to do he just using you for his own plan he dont care nothing bout you here have some but willie had been shaken by the reprimand he lowered his head humph the guard snorted as he left jason saw the disapproval in chenaults eyes as he studied willie he must think this could become a serious split in the group so soon hope he can pull it back together placing himself in the open space by the toilet chenault sat down with his legs crossed under neath him and called to johnnie one of the older fellows let me use your dice johnnie i saw you put them in the corner when they came for the clothes johnnie handed over the dice hey ben chenault said lets shoot some craps ben showed his yellow illcaredfor teeth in a generous grin and came over to stand in front of chenault jason always enjoyed ben especially at times like this when he put on his mock stance of authority one blacknailed foot jutting forward his hands spread out before him like fans and his big black stomach protruding out over the white shorts his huge eyes glittered round the cell capturing the attention of the other prisoners for whom the coming exchange was designed he peered down at chenault and affected a lisp nigger you knows you cant shoot no crapths i thought i taught you a lesson bout dat last mont at the staff meetink ben is a smart cat putting on that lisp to accentuate the difference between his ninthgrade education and chenaults graduate degree must know it helps the other fellows to identify with him chenault smiled up at ben you took my money last time but i had been drinking a little ben slapped his stomach and rubbed his hands together well he said you axed for it he came down on one knee pulled his own dice from the waistband of his shorts and cast them onto the cement floor they began to play with ben using his own loaded dice to set the pattern of the game he would allow chenault to win would beat him mercilessly and then would woo him back into the competition by allowing him to win again the mood of the spectators bore an inverse relationship to chenaults success in the game when chenault was winning they were quiet and pensive when he was losing they were loud and playful joking about how hot it was in the cell and how mad the guard had been yesterday all around jason fellows were proudly chiding ben for cheating chenault out of his money though the mood became so easy that even willie c joined in the catcalls still no one spoke directly to chenault they joked to one another about him referring to his grand theories and to his disinterest in underwear but he remained essentially offlimits jason noticed that although no one spoke to chenault everyones gaze was directed at his kneeling figure they really want to get at chenault must be feeling some resentment at him for leading them into this mess matter of fact if hadnt listened to him wouldnt be stuck in this ugly place why dont they go on and laugh at him thats what he wants well dont mind getting on him got a few bones to pick myself man jason said to chenault if you cant play any better why dont you get the hell out of the game you know you aint good for nothing but thinking chenault responded immediately jason i know you aint talking to me why i picked you up out of the card room at harvard and made a man out of you if it hadnt been for me youd a been playing rummy for matchsticks with a bunch of lazy students right now grinning jason retorted you made something out of me man if i hadnt been around to keep you out of trouble youd a been dead right now just remember back to the time when you let the staff leave you on the drew plantation without even a car to get away said we should depend more on the people if i hadnt come and gotten you you would have been buried under that sharecroppers shack and the man still wouldnt have been registered to vote humph talking about all youve done for me you cant hardly take care of yourself jason turned to the others do you all remember when miss suzie mae was after him everyone laughed yes rev johnson he asked how did chenault get that scar on his shoulder and having opened the way for the others jason leaned back on the bunk rev johnson answered in his best pulpit manner well way i remember the thing miss suzie mae had been chasing after chenault here for a long time she used to come over to the office and fix food and clean up for all of us just so she could be round chenault she be there sometime at six oclock in the morning and stay all day someone interrupted shouting out you forgot to say how big she was oh yes rev johnson said she was twice as big as chenault could pick him up if she wanted to wasnt bad looking didnt have much hair on her head but still she looked all right had a husband that worked on the railroad anyway shed come over all the time and chenault would try to give her stuff to do to keep her busy he was shamed to have her cleaning up for him and all so hed send her canvassing give her books to look at everything yall remember when he tried to teach her how to type she couldnt hardly read and he was gonna make her into a secretary put her in front of the typewriter told her he knew she could do it and said type course she didnt never learn to type but she always acted like she was trying hard a least for as long as she could keep her mind off chenault well he tried his best to keep her busy but she always would come and say she was through a half hour after he give her something to do and she just kept trying to get him to bed with her affirmation from the others yeah thats right she sure kept after him rev johnson went on after bout two months of this chenault started getting weak i remember he started to giving her a job to do and then going out the back door so she wouldnt have no excuse for not doing it but she would catch him in an hour cause she knowed everywhere he could go in that little town so finally he just gave up and let her take him home rev johnson swelled up on his toes bent his back and hollowed his shoulders all the while he was spreading out his arms so that to jason he looked like a great eagle when he had reached his full expanse he clapped his hands together sharply hah and then do you know what happened enraptured cries now you coming to the best part what happened next reverend tell it like it is and fleeting glances at chenault to assure that he was not angry well time chenault and miss suzie mae got in bed time they got they business done and had got off to sleep her husband come slam ming through the door home from the railroad cheers slapping of knees laughter chenault jumped outta the bed and went through the window miss suzie maes husband come on after him with his gun and grazed him right there in the shoulder and you all know chenault dont wear no underwearand didnt have time to put on no pants all naked like that he couldnt even stop nowhere and ask for no help had to run all the way back to the freedom house and we got him out of town that night now satisfaction and remarks to prolong the story yeah thats sure how it happened man when i saw chenault sitting up at the house all naked and mad as he could be i laughed so hard it hurt and then to chenault chenault why you wait so long til her husband was ready to come home fore you got you some ass his head tilted back and his green eyes sparkling chenault answered i was afraid he was going to come followed by more gushing spluttering laughter which finally subsided into a general atmosphere of relaxation now a reservoir of unacknowledged emotions was released jason heard his own fears echoed by the others he too was worried that they might have to serve their full fiveyear sentences and he had begun to doubt that the workers on the outside would get the bond he had become afraid that he could not last long without food hearing the others and reassuring them that things would work out he began to feel better himself it even seemed a little cooler in the cell the crap game having served its function ben returned the dice to his waistband and announced chenaults debt of chenault admitted defeat as he stood willie c called to him chenault what made you think you could teach miss suzie mae how to keep the office and type and all willie i guess i just thought i could do it i thought she had talent that shed never had a chance to use before and that i could give her the chance to develop it and do you still think that yes the days thereafter assumed a common pattern jason suffocated in the heat during the day and in the cold night he shivered for hours and berated himself for having willingly come to this filthy place it would be late in the night before he could sufficiently exhaust his mind and body so that he could finally drop off to sleep then at five the next morning an hour or so after hed gone to sleep he would be awakened by the guards demand that they go out to the field to work daily the prisoners refused to work the guard would then announce that they would get no food and would stomp out of the cell block followed by the young trusty with the armload of striped clothing as the days passed the guard demanded more intensely and angrily that they go to work but they continued to refuse in the mornings having been completely aroused by the confrontation with the guard jason would give up his efforts to sleep and would drag himself over to wash his face he would join in the exercises and singing and the games and would lapse at times into a fitful sleep through it all he was encouraged by watching chenault who seemed to be thriving in the dark musty cell he was awake and washed before the guard came banging on the bars he would rout out the others and would laugh and talk with them throughout the day he seemed to be tuned in on the moods of the other prisoners when jason himself became irritable and depressed it was chenault who appeared next to him on the bunk reminding him of an eccentric teacher they had had in college or sharing with him his plan for the movements growth in mississippi chenault confided to him in these discussions that he had found his lifes work in the civil_rights struggle if the movement succeeded his life would have been well spent if not it would have been wasted for him every demonstration every confrontation with the whites was intensely important because jason realized how important it was to chenault that they emerge from the jail as an unbroken group he would set aside his depression and would try once more to talk and joke with the others for four days the group bore the discomfort and the hunger with only a minimum of prodding and encouragement but on the fifth day some began to weaken and with the weakness came insecurity and fear there were arguments in which some battered against the logic or refusing to work and to eat a few began to fight over who should play with the dice or who should have to sleep on the floor instead of ignoring the guard when he came around some began to whisper stealthily with him worst among these was willie c three times in one day jason saw fellows pulling willie c back from the bars so that he could not whisper with the guard when this happened the guard cackled happily and sauntered out of the cell block c c c c c on the seventh night of the fasting jason was surprised by the familiar nasal voice of the guard he did not usually come to harass them late at night he unlocked the door and intruded his massive body into the cell willie c his voice twanged i got something for you want you to come on with me jason watched unbelieving as willie c slowly rose from the bunk he grabbed the boys arm to restrain him but willie c shook loose and followed the guard from the cell amid the curses of the other prisoners jason struggled to understand willies action why would the boy do a thing like that c c c sje the next morning willie c was installed in the empty cell across from them the young trusty brought him a mattress blankets cigarettes tobacco candy and a tin of food while the guard watched willie c climbed into the striped uniform after the guard left willie c tried to talk with ben hey ben them guards aint so bad they didnt hurt me none just talked to me a while and give me all these things look i got a mattress and this salt meat dont taste bad after a week of nothing but water ben surveyed the faces of the others hes trying to decide how to treat willie everyone but chenault seems to have frozen up guess that means theyre going to ignore willie c dont know much about this kind of thing myself better watch chenault follow his lead nervously breaking the silence willie c offered some of his new possessions hey yall want some candy how bout some tobacco i got cigarettes and tobacco cause i knowed yaild want some ben i knows you likes to smoke here catch he threw the can of tobacco and a package of wrapping papers across the aisle ben did not reach out to catch them and they fell just short of the cell ben willie c implored they right in front a you pick them up thats a lot of tobacco ben announced i dont want nothing from you and turned his back to the boy chenault came to the front of the cell his eyes moved methodically to willie c to the other prisoners and back to willie c lets talk more about this he said hmm thats odd normally hed let the fellows fight something like this out among themselves wouldnt step in the middle of it like that must really be worried that the group will fall apart this time its silly to try and ignore willie vhen hes right across the aisle from us chenault continued why do you think the guard put him there no weve got to work this thing out ben said aint nothing to work out he rather do what white folks tell him its all right with us but we aint gonna have nothing to do with him but ben chenault said maybe willie didnt really do anything bad looking into willies unhappy eyes he asked besides taking the mattress and stuff from them did you do anything else willie what did you talk to them about last night willie c at first evaded chenaults question mumbling and pulling nervously at his blanket his silence was met by the derision of the others hes so dumb he tole them everything he know and in falsetto voice willie did you tell them how much you love white folks probably gave them some ass while he was at it with each accusation jason saw the anger rise further in willie c trembling he flung himself against the bars just had to fuck with me didnt you he shouted alright i tell you what i did i signed a goddam statement that chenault was corrupting the morals of a youth by convincing me to demonstrate and get put in jail when i didnt want to do it now laugh bout that laugh bout the years chenault can get for that how could he do that to chenault thats a hard charge to beat chenault might have to serve those years what could be on willies mind chenault must be furious chenaults manner did not change he spoke softly thats rough willie but we can get the lawyers to work on it when we get out what worries me is why you did it try to explain ii just dont understand willie c answered cause i was hungry and he that guard say some things last night that was true and he told me i just had to go long with him and i could have some food and a mattress and all chenault said what could he possibly have said that was true willie well like he say bout i dont have no say over what we gonna do just always do what you tell me say yall just using me using you how could you think that willie what have we ever used you for you know last year the machine willie answered machine what machine last yearthat was before i came chenault had turned to ben in apparent confusion ben whats willie talking about i dont remember any machine jason could feel a discomfort among the others they shifted their positions and stared hard at the floor what could be so bad about a machine why are they so emm barrassed rev johnson said maybe explain some other time ben after we get out of here goddamit johnson ben said its time for chenault to know if he always want to know everything he got to take the bad with the good now do you want to tell him or you want me to do it well rev johnson said i guess its better for me to tell it chenault willies talking about that time last year when you tole him you was gonna make him the project director to take your place you remember you and him was running round buying him a desk to keep his papers in and you was introducing him to the people from the north who was raising money for the project so he would have contact with all the resources you gave him books to read and youd sit next to him at dinner so you could talk to him bout the books and bout how things should go when he took over afraid you got him all excited bout how important he was gonna be you remember now of course i remember that chenault said but what did it have to do with any machine chenault ben said you supposed to be so smart but you dont see nothing plain and simple you found out it was too hard you found out you couldnt give willie eight years of education in two months he couldnt do research on the power structure of the state til he learned how to write he couldnt follow your logic cause his mind didnt work that way and you cut his ass loose you put him in the back of the office in the storeroom gave him a tube of ink and made him the director of the mimeograph machine and you made it worse by telling him that running that silly machine all day was very important for the movement had everybody tipping round trying to make him feel better by asking him to please make them a hundred copies of something had them tipping round like that when everybody knew that he had flunked out everybody knew willie wasnt shit thats what the fuck he was talking bout oh no poor chenault so willie cracked because of him in the painful silence chenault closed his eyes and slowly nodded his head how could he make such a mistake and willie he must have been miserable to have hoped for so much and ended up with a mimeograph machine chenault spoke haltingly his old air of competence gone now thats aa problem ill have to work on i must have misunderstood last year but the problem the problem for all of us now is willie hes only seventeen seventeen we cant expect him to think like we do and im afraid its clear now that he had some cause to do what he did maybe it was my fault i accept the responsibility for his actions thats foolish ben said you cant take the blame for willie hes a man been doing a mans work since he was fourteen and he got to pay for his mistakes like anybody else chenault could not answer covering his eyes with his hands he withdrew into the shadows of the cell for the rest of the day the prisoners argued over willie c chenault said nothing he only sat balled up on the floor rocking back and forth when some of them began to drop off to sleep jason came over and sat down on the floor next to chenault he felt bound to share chenaults miseryas if sharing it helped knowing no words he could only stare into chenaults brooding face sometimes catching his eye and trying to smile at times he would clasp chenaults shoulder and then he would be shot through with the thousands of tiny vibrations which racked his friends body he welcomed the darkness and the dulling whir of the fans late in the night jason heard an unfamiliar sound over the noise of the fans next to him chenault raised his head he too had heard the sound it was willie c crying chenault breathed oh no and he shrank back against the wall pushing himself into the stone away from the sound as jason sat helplessly search ing for a way to relieve his friend he heard voices above him he distinguished the soft voices of rev johnson and two of the younger fellows they called across the aisle willie hey willie what you doing over there didnt know you was woke man you aint crying is you willie aint nothing to cry bout boy we have you outta there in no time make that fat guard so mad he throw you back in here with us bad niggers nothing to worry bout and bens deep bass voice saying throw over some a them cigarettes man folks over here wants to smoke you plunk the final chord and hold it down its parts linger guckie smen seeping through the screen you

shining in the lamplight that peace youre looking for can wait you tell yourself you practice through your scales all twelve then you turn the ragged pages of the czerny mama give you secondhand for christmas you find the hardest exercise and get down to work you got to be somebody you got to inregard to the human rights struggle i see the negro college as a sp ecial institution isee the negro college as standing in u peculiar relationship to that struggle iam often told that this is a pred ominantly negro college not anegro college they mean that there are per cent or per cent negroes etc isay this is a negro college meaning by that that prec isely because of the black predominance there is a prevailing ethos which pervades the negro college campus an ethos distinctive to that campus this ethos this spirit if you please comes precisely out of the context of black experience black tradition black heritage this ethos is a function of the fact that most of the black students in that college come from a particular so cio cultural environment characterized by its deliberate exclusion from benefits and services of the larger society this environment this exclusion this resultant ethos cannot be treated as if they did not exist or as if they were not relevant they are precisely relevant to the kinds of courses we offer to the kinds of faculty we hire to the kinds of administrators we hire to the kinds of goals we seek in our haste and quest to make middle class people out of black students we have probably overlooked the f act that those black people have insights that we should heed insights indeed not only about themselves and their background but insights about the nature of this society in which we live and i am suggesting that perhaps we have constructed an academic curriculum on some assumptions we have not been entitled to make such as the desirability of the middle class goal the efficacy of white oriented control the desirability of a calm objective posture vis a vis civil_rights i say that we must start now to tum to black people students faculty etc to find out what their insights tell us about what kind of college we should have to tell us to explain that black oriented ethos so that we might hopefully become more relevant let me cite professor kenneth b clark on n this in an article he wrote in ebony for august this article is based upon the assumption that it is possible for an american negro social psychologist to understand certain aspects of the american culture and the psychology of whites with somewhat more clarity than is generally possible f or whites who are accepted by and completely identified with this culture it is possible that a negro who has been trained in the discipline of the social sciences may be less influeenced by certain subj ective distortions which are operative in the american culture or he may bring to his view of this culture certain counterbalancing distortions the negro in america by virtue of the pervasive patterns of racial rejection exclusion or a token and often self conscious acceptance by a minority of white liberals has been farced into a degree of alienation and detachment which has resulted in a pattern of social and personality consequences among these consequences has been sharpened insights and increa sed sensitivity to some of the subtle forces which are significan t in our complex social structure we would prefer to reject or overlook these words of professor clark because they are revolution ary they challenge they require us to reexamine some of our established beliefs and values and traditions and assumptions but i propose a black college revolutionary inits purposesrevolutionary in its procedures revolutionary in its goals i propose a black college which would be for the first time legitimate vis a vis that distinctive ethos not in relation to a larger white anachronistic middle class i propose a black college that would quickly understand that western technology is not the criterion of greatness advanced technology is merely the development of material comfort yes and expanded life but of what value is that comfort if the citizens in the black belts and the black ghettos are systematically denied it no human society would do that only a sub human one and i do not propose a college that would graduate students into sub humanity of what value is the knowledge of medicine that extends life when political decision makers snuff out lives of defenseless women and children in vietnam oh no no human society would do that only a basically sub human one and so i am not impressed with the advanced technology the skyscrapers the gigantic communications systems the modern sanitary facilities when i see the lack of nj odernity in that societys relationship to oppressed peoples i am not impressed with a society where in black college graduates with one year of postgraduate work can expect a lifetime earning of while a white male high school graduate can expect to earn i propose a black college that would do many broad things educationally it would not be bound in all disciplines and especially my own of political science by the basically irrelevant gres for so long we know that higher education has not dealt with the role and function of the black man in america now they are trying to catch up to become relevant some law schools are adding courses on landlord and tenant before it was only corporations and property some schools are scurrying around trying to establish urban studies centers as if they can research their way to a relevancy to the ghetto i propose a black college that would not only study the ghetto but get its stud ents from there that would prepare its students to go back there to assume roles of leadership i propose a black college with specific courses in economics e g economic coops in the ghetto political science e g viable political movements in the ghetto business administration eg the business potential of the ghetto etc i propose a black college that would offer summer and other season in service training for students who would prepare themselves for leadership in the ghetto communities by living in and organizing in those communities i propose a black college that would make the history of african civilization at least a three year course and required for graduation i propose a black college whose curriculum goal would be relevancy to the lives of the students and their experiences i would not be concerned about the question about the gres or the question what kinds of jobs would your graduates be prepared to perform these questions would not concern me because they are embedded in the context and parochialism of yesterday and today i am talking modernization i am talking tomorrow and tomorrow we know that only those with relevant educations will be able to save this sick society from chaos my graduates would be called upon because they and only they would be the true dr doctors the larger society has failed to meet the needs of the ghettos we know that some time ago mr henry nichols of the philadelphia school board its vice chairman said that per cent of the black high school graduates in that city are fun ctionally illiteratethis results he said from the fact that phi ladelphia has in effect two school systems one for the black ghetto the other for the white society i propose a black college that would graduate students to go to that city and hundreds like that one and organize to challenge and change that despicable situation i propose a bl ack college that would deliberately strive to inculate a sense of racial pri de and anger and concern in its students i propose a black college where one of the criteria for graduating summa cum laude would be the demonstrated militancy of the candidate this may all sound silly it may sound ou of order but you see i operate fromthe point of view that too many of us have been inorder for too long i propose a black college that wouldbea felt dominant force in the community in which it exists a college which would useitsaccumulated intellectual knowledge and econcmic resources to bring about desired changes in race relations in the community a college that wotld offer free remedial training and education for black adults and school drop outs a college that would be intimate friends notfoe to the black citizens surrounding it a college that would do business only with thosewho hired its students and contributed a certain predetermined amount to the colleges scholarship fundsi propose a black college that would embark on these programs not fearful of reprisals because the college i propose vould seek its raison detre not in the sanction and approval of others but in the sanction and approval of its black students and their black parents and again i know the question will come where will you get the money what foundations or governments will support you my answer may seem naive but i would rather close down my college than cut down on my principles if that cut meant kow towing to those public or private who would impose unacceptable conditions on their grants because you see in the final analysis only a man who is his own man can be a legitimate man i propose a college that would insist first on being its own manbefore it attempted to go into the business of educating men and women i propose a black college whose faculty and administrators would be on fire with the desire to eradicate human injustice a college whose faculty and administrators would reject the shibboleths of objectivity and aloofness because they would know that these are merely synonyms for passivity and irrelevancy i propose a black college then that would adopt as its preamble the avowed purpose to pose the hard questions to challenge established myths a college that would feel ashamed of itself if its graduates did not become active fighters for human dignity and social justice a college that would recruit as students those freedom fighters in the same way that some collegestoday recruit football players i propose a black college that would grant honorary degrees to the paul robesons and john hulletts of lowndes county to the amzi moores of cleveland mississippi to the mr mcclains of nottingham penna i propose a black college that would hire a fannie lou hamer and welfare mothers as professors of social action a college where ferment was a reality not superficial rhetoric a college that would see an alex melton of west chester and charles butler of coatesville as times more legitimate in community organization than full professors of political science and sociology from harvard yale or princeton i propose a black college that would recognize and utilize the talents of these people as surely as some colleges now bargain for irrelevant phds it is clear in my mind that there are very few legitimate places in this society where we can expect militant outspoken protest to originate the negro college must fill that vacuum it must be relevant in a way that the church has not been in a way that labor unions have not been in a way that socalled liberal groups have not beenthe primary role of the students at that college is to be a student to study to prepare frankly i do not expect the students to be on the front line action actively leading that time for them will come later the active leadership should come from the faculty and administration that is why this human rights leadership course this year stressed teaching and studying there are no exams in this course the test will come when the students have already graduated and are living day to day in their respective communities how will they relate to that discriminatory school board how will they fight discriminatory employers and real estate brokers these will be the tests and i assure you no greater no more important examinations will be taken in our time and people will ask what about accreditation and i will answer our relevancy and legitimacy will accredit us how crtditable can the present system be when it cripples hundreds of thousands of black students annually my final thoughts are these i am quite sure that we are in a stage of history which is confusing and bothersome to many people it is a stage of dynamism calling for militancy not moderation calling for manhood not mediocrity the old language the old cliches must be thrown aside we must not follow the philosophy of edmund burke and be afraid to make changes we must challenge the future and reject the past we must not cannot march into tomorrow on the drum beats of yesterday we must march to a dif f erent drummer we must not approach these burning issues as if yesterdays formulas were valid we must exp eriment we must innovate we must declare our modernity and our manhood there will be those who will accuse us of being hatersthey will accuse us of being segregationists we will be accused of being passionate and subjective and intolerant and they will be right we must be haters of injustice we must segregate ourselves from ignorance we must be passionate about our desire our will to be men we must be intolerant of all those who would counsel caution the negro college is oneof americas few legitimate bastions of relevancy if it fails there will be created a vacuum of leadership not to befilled in this or succeeding generations the problem is ju st that serious the burden is just that great i gave a talk at northem illinois university in dekalb illinois recently and some one asked if you are so alienated why dont you and your kind leave the country there are many answers to this but the most important one is this country needs its alienated people in point of real fact going back to kenneth clarkwe have insights that can help save this society that can help civilize this essentially sub human society this is a job for the militant not the moderate not the middle ofthe roader protect your relevancy with a passion and centuries from now history will record oh yes in the latter half of the th century the most meaningful voices came from the black college campuses those voices those campuses were intune with the future they perf ormed the function of clarity and conscience they pointed up viable alternatives when many others slinked low and proceeded cautiously the black colleges were the avant gard e the black colleges provided the insights that got the society through a terrible turbulent period and that historical account will be very very correct the afroamerican student is currently being swept up by the whirl pool of a merican racism he is continuously confronted with degrading images of his self and supremacist images of whitesin many cases the feeling of inferiority is instilled as early as age three through the childsfamily and environment later the elementary and high schools reinforce inferiority feelings to such an extent that by the time the afro american youth is a freshman in college all that is needed to complete this black automaton of inferiority is the embellishments of academic manifestations of racism hence a charlatan carbon copy bourgeois is molded with superficial thoughts of individuality steeped in judeo christian pragmatic concepts such as competitiveness is the thing the bourgeois negro is too sophisticated to stab his brother on friday night liberalistic subtlety bestowed upon them by their synthetic teachers only allows them to run away from their brothers their crudeness and their horrible rat infested environment to be a black bourgeois is to be at once trying to become vice king of the whites dunghill and acting like the fly with rape in mind on the elephants back in the afro american students quest to reject himself and his brothers he loses what potential power he has he begins to conceive of power as a cadillac a light skinned straight haired wife a suburban home and a perfunctory job with some white supercorporation power becomes the pursuit of happiness where happiness is material wealth designed to be obsolete in a matter of a few years money is the manifestation of power they fail to see that the richest black american can be eliminated by any white person who calls him a nigger his humanity is nullified through that one act the students mental energies are expended attempting to secure the proper image mannerisms voice characteristics and sexual attitudes of their white colonizers they are constantly restraining from exposing their primitiveness that is their soulfu lness their sexual life istom asunder trying to hold on to the judeochristian concept of spirituality sansfleshbut beingblack does not makeevery young afro american frivolously frenetic the rise of militancy there are those afro american brothers and sisters who are becoming increasingly aware of themselves and of the depth of racism of america many of the blackmilitant students frequently of middle class background can be physically identified by their proud carriage and naturalafro hair style the black militant student frequently is a science or psychology major comparatively few political science and humanities students become militant thereare reasons for this it appears thatthe political awakening of a black student varies inversely with the amount of exposure he has had with academic political science and humanities the less he is exposed to it thewestern political and humanitiesscene the more his political potentiality seems to have a chance of becoming actualizedwestern political and humanitarian thought is entangled in the briarbush of objectivity and individuality in the naive or nonaware black students quest to be less sinful and evil that is to be less black he assimulates and acculturates he becomes more of an american than the white man in his drive to be white he overcompensates ultimately he becomes an apolitical being aloofly viewing the world from the underside of the white mans pulverizing ivory tower the non aware black student becomes narcissistically infatuated with gaining knowledge of the world whereas in many cases the non aware black student who is a science major will have the po tential to absorb various types of political and cultural systems more unbiasedly than the arts student he is potentially able to visualize contradictions within the american society because of his acquired ability to reason deductively the rise of black militancy means that students must consolidate a pr ogrammatic national approach to their particular needs and goals within the black liberation movement they must communicate frequently with one another for this to be eff ective the militant black student needs a central point of view and dissemination what is needed is a national afro american student association which initially serves as a clearing house for communication and national coordination this type of structure allows for a diversified but cohesive approach so necessary for the liberation struggle black student groups must approach their particular problems through a national and world viewpoint we must begin to realize that racism prevails everywhere in the world in many different forms students at tuskegee institute use techniques of liberation suited to alabamas style of racism while angolan students use other techniques nationalizing the black student movement brings a sense of black solidarity the student as black militant grassroots or no roots the black students role in the movement is vital and varied first of all he must continue his education dropping out of school to work in the movement in many cases is romantic escapism from a reality difficult to face up to because we have less than six per cent of our high school graduates going to college and more than half of that number female we have to try to keep brothers from dropping out if the school is not educating well and the student realizes it dropping out wont solve the problem and he will not get the necessary technical education in the movement or on the streets we are almost obligated to stay at a jive bourgeois college and attempt to get as much information out of its educational f acilities as possible and attempt to reveal to untogether brothers and sisters the real happenings in the world or if at a white college the students have accessto all kinds of information from their library and other sources not ordinarily available to blacks the black student as militant must know how to identify and communicate with himself and his brothers in the street in most cases from whence he came he must be willing to sacrifice and to assu me responsibilities howard universitys newly formed black_power committee has issued aims that can be adopted by black students on the whole the overthrow of the negro college with white innards to raise in its place a militant black university which will counteract the white washing black students now receive in negro and white institutions our goals revolve around the complete revamping of the negro college moreover wemust have a complete overhauling of the pres ent curricula and the building of courses of study more pertinent to the present and future demands of the black struggle in america and the world at the same time it is necessary to launch a vigorous campaign to change the names of black un vers t es to commemorate the courage and deeds of black thinkers and theonsts the feasibility of converting fed erally funded howard into a black militant university is another story what is more important is that the brothers at howard appear to be ready to deal with the issues for example to deplore the vietnam war and overdraf ting of black americans is not enough we must begin to form alternatives to the draft black students can help in setting up local black draft and recruitment centers where brothers and sisters can come to join the black army which will initially be fighting a nonphysical wadare that is voter registration psychological warf are organizing political blocs freedom troops for the work in the backwoods of the south and the north etc another goal of campus organizing should be to encourage students to continue their education for the sake of building an intellectual communitythat would turn create an ideologyof black liberation for america and subsequentlyfor the bandung third world campus chapters of the afroamerican student association will need a pan hellenic committee to find ways to utilize the black fraternal orders which are national in scope and black in body it has been shown that as black racial relevancy becomes accepted by the students as their position the black greek orders initially for selfish reasons want to participate in the movement when the localfrat chapter begins to see the seriousness of racism and the need to have a sense of self awareness then it is time to put its power and unity to work militant students should not fall into the trap of just condemning black greek orders for their bourgeois behavior they must be shown their contradictory stand and what role they can play in the movement as a fraternity another goal should be finding methods to achieve better understanding and cooperation between afro americans and africans even today there is a tremendous amount of reciprocal animosity between black americans and africans achieving this goal is a long and arduous task that will take years of re education and personal contact black students on white campuses the militant blacks who go to white schools must suffer through a frustrating dilemma their soulfulness will be forced out of them and sucked by those weird apolitical ofay radicals to add salt to the wound the black students on white campuses frequently have to try to develop miles and miles from soulville a black community as a result they tend to overintellectualize and romanticize the struggle so that when they come home it is often difficult for them to relate to the harsh nonintellectual and very unromantic ghetto reality the prevailing hang ups of black militants on white campuses are of ten due to association with the new white left the new left is apolitical because of its p ragmatic mindless outlook which makes them shirk their necessary theoretical duties being the most tangible and immediate model of radicalism many new left concepts are adopted by the militant blacks they get caught in vicious rhetorical arguments about academic nationalism and other esoteric trivia to help clear the air of these consequences the militant black students should communicate more with the nationalist brothers in the black communities correspond andor visit the black colleges which have miitant groups and take some of the vacation time to work with some nitty gritty community group in this way the amount of abstract objective intellectualiza tion of black reality will be kept at a minimum a final word as we have seen before his power can be utilized the black student must find himself and then deal with the hang ups and pitfalls of being black in americahe is forced not to be pragmaticmindless within a pragmatically paranoid society he is compelled to be theoretical when society dictates anti intellectualism in short the black student is swimming upstream with weighted boots he must strugglewith his bourgeoisaspiring brothers who arein the vast majority and yet he must come to grips with endemic racism the black student should under stand his relationship to and his usage of violence the violence within us should be channelled for positive intellectual development the violence within us should not be contained in the senseof the judeo christian concept of containment displacing aggression we neither havethe time nor the need to displace our aggression fists and brains go politicallytogether in the make up of a militant intellectual in orderto substantiate our theoretical and therefore intellectual positions we must oftentimesflex our physical muscles inshort wemust fight our use of the various levels of violence dependsonour knowledgeof political expediency timing we have to view the future from a probabilistic basis the way we actualize our theories is dependent upon what we expect to gain from its specific use if we use method x or y we must know its consequences and alternatives we cannot forget that struggling for survival is no game the oppressor knows this violence is no toy violence plays a vital role in the colonialists strategies of dominance where political sophistication subtlely bludgeons the oppressed into a state of almost hereditary despondency indeed when we begin to utilize our various levels of action we must never forget that america has institutionalized violence to the extent that it is strategically generated by and through its culture this is one of the reasons for example why sncc failed to successfully politicalize lowndes county alabama they were playing romantic games while the system computerized their most probable routes of action what does this mean to the afro american student america is not the world and racism does not confine itself to america ultimately it means that the af ro a merican student m u st think he must observe analyze and synthesizeand yet he must be subjective enough to allow his spirituality to grow and become functional in the strain toward racial relevancy and black liberation indeed to be black is not enough and to be bitter is not enough to know of our magnificent black heritage is still not enough we must become dedicated militant human beings continuously questioning the roots of society in a word black humani sm throughout our land a sad voice tells of a terrifying loss regardless of the mourners words to the contrary we know that they suffer an unspeakable grief for you do not lose a habit a friend or even a god with out learning something about pain life and death of ten this new knowledge forces us to look inward seeking a new arrangement of the old familiar feelings and thoughts in order to find strength to carry on with this thing called living for life must be lived and somehow we know that joy will follow pain most men have this faith and meet their days with this belief yet there is the voice that tells of a great lossgod has died and man must create and find him anewi n free to live free to die holt rinehart and winston by malcolm boyd we hear the voice of an episcopal priest who now functions as chaplain at large to u s university students boyd has left the established sanctuary of the suburban church to become a part of the alienated and by the alienated i mean the beat crowd the hippies and the negro whose alienation from american society began with his arrival on these unhappy shores boyd goes beyond these groups though he tells us about the middle class plodders and the jet set covering such a vide range of social types his ministry seems to have taken on a one man personal contact type billy grahamcrusade perhaps it is not the people with whom he associates that marks him but the way he seesthem and he sees them through the eyes heart and mind of an adolescent such a perspective regardless of the personal intentions or sentiments is unbecoming tragic and sterile lets look at this new breed of minister he usually is disgusted frustrated and spiritually tortured by the middle class congregation he serves he finds that his congregation is more concerned with buildings organs pews and missionary work in far off places where good is effortlessly and safely done his congregation can be stirred to great compassion and a few tears by the suffering of the oppressed hungarians the starving indians and the brutalized vietnamese the negros hostility violence and voiced hatreds have all placed him beyond the pale of the deserving for in order to receive christian charity the recipient must be humble deserving and eternally grateful to his benefactor otherwise the benevolent christian receives no confirmation of his goodness and his right to give above all the christian must have his guilt assuaged by the humble gratitude of the recipient the gians are telling us something quite different from what their words imply it has nothing to do with god or gods simply it isthat their world no longer exists this world view ran roughshod over most conflicts and indictments the world was soon to be cast in the mold of the legendary revered peacefulness and righteousness of wellington ohio or any ice cream social saturday here mothers were loved beyond reason and human capacity protestant churches exhorted sinners in abstract irrelevant terms making sure that none was offended nor saved for all in all god not only smiled on the town square but favored it above all other squares name of the game is im the boss and dont you forget it it is no wonder that few young men enter the ministry todayfrom those who have we hear that god is dead you cannot help but wonder how ministers would be aware of such a death since the majority of them follow their congregations this pronouncement revelation or reasoned conclusion would be hilarious if it were not tragic for it reflects the extremes to which a people will go to preserve a delusion a particular madness that prevents them from confronting themselves with what they are or as it may be from seeing themselves as far too many others see them by announcing the death of god these ministers or theolo the schools were staff ed by dedicated teachers not noted for their intellectual strength but devoted to perpetuating the myth although the social studies taught in these schools was little more than a highly fictionalized romantic rendering of the world and its people it perpetuated the myth it placed the wellington ohios and their values in the center of the uni verse negroes and all other colored people were viewed as something inferior and naturally god ordained it so these black unfortunates served a good purpose they reaffirmed the myth and all the values surrounding it ironically and outrageously these people believed that everyone else in the world shared this delusion or at least coveted it even today many americans cannot believe that this myth is not shared by all even when told in plain direct language that their myth is the nightmare of others they dismiss the blatant horrible consequences of their myth and speak of the need to communicate and how do two men communicate when one denies the others dignity equality and suffering at the same time the one denied his humanity has learned to hate beyond his own understanding first he learned to hate himself now finding some pride and selfrespect within himself he has learned to hate the enemy today the enemy happens to be white now the only difference between the white mans hatred for the negro and the negros hatred for the white man is that white hatred has become institutionalized as an acceptable way of life it is seldom spoken except by the not so lunatic fringe there are many defenses and arguments given to protect this right to hate such as property rights not now and thats how people are but to stand and tell a man that you hate him is just not the american way the expression of any true emotion seems to set off a tidal wave of apprehension throughout the land we are far better at hiding our feelings than expressing them consequently we pay the price for this concealment for having never learned to live with our emotions we have learned to be at their mercy this insanity has no bounds and recognizes few contradictions we are quite willing to send our sons and daughters to fight and die for the alleged freedom of a people we would not want to live next door to there have been few south vietnamese refugees settled in this country i wonder what the reaction of our god fearing anti communist americans would be if souh vietnamese refugees were landed in san francisco to be resettled in california or alabama if such were to come to pass we would see riots taking place that would make watts seem like a trip to disneyland and oh the justif ying slogans words and arguments i do not want to give the impression that saturday night in wellington ohiois a second rate heaven that it is not for as quiet as it is kept the people in wellington are quite human they do all the things that any other people do all of their human acts however never force them to examine themselvesand to discover what they are it isas though all of their human frailties have received divine sanction a blessing thathas been denied all others especially all otherswho differ too significantly fromthe people of wellington some young americansliving in the wellingtons and suburbs of our land are fleeing to hippy towns and raising hell on university campuses another sanctuary of the polite manner and myth the world being what it is today many young americans know that a great sea exists between what they are told to believe and what they see happening around them this is a crushing and sad experience for the young for youth is a time of dreams hopes and strivings to make the impossible possible the beauty of it is that for young people brotherhood and love are not dreams but luring realities some of these young people have chosen this reality they have denounced the hypocrisy of their leaders and elders in strange and certainly not always sane ways they seek a new world a world that self interest fear and the old myth will not permit in their communities it is important to remember that these young people are primarily from middle class and upper middle class families so they do not represent in any large number the negro or any other minority group in america it is also interesting to note that when they are attacked it is their dress and personal hygiene that are denounced their use of drugs often brands them as being irresponsible and no doubt some of them are just as some of the good people in wellington are regarding drugs in america the question is not whether they will be taken but when and under what circumstances for it should be common knowledge that the use of tranquilizers in this country is probably rivaling aspirin consumption and that is no small habit those young adults experimenting with drugs were introduced to them in their respectable homes in the form of tranquilizers of a thousand varieties what is significant is that few people answer their charges and indictments of society what has all this to do with malcolm boyds ministry mr boyd and all his kin seem to have abandoned the source of the problem the problem resides in all the wellington ohios and suburban communities in america that drive their young from them if america is to survive it cannot be saved by ministering to a few thousand adolescents and young adults the young adults are running from their homes it would seem that these homes are in need of spiritual rehabilitation if the core is rotten this is where you will find the worn but here it takes courage patience and a dedication that only god can give any minister who sets this as his task must be willing to suffer all the abuse that an irate myth wed christian can hurl upon him and believe me these christians have been practicing cruelty since they threw the first pagan to the lions to awaken a people to what they are is a thankless task but to show them what they can become and to help them achieve it approaches divine gloryon the other hand for a minister to flee to social limbo and join the outcasts is the easy way out it is the missionary of the pre world war ii era all over again and no doubt the results will be the same totally irrelevant obviously mr boydmust plan to become an eternal adolescent for in the hippy joints and other farout places we find the young rarely do we see anold beatnik time cures many things and it inflicts a special malice on the young it is adolescent and uselessly so to tell us that men are free to live and free to die to recite the sufferings of the prostitute the lifebored jet setter the oppressed negro and other human beings without giving some hope or some explicit value is true abdication of all responsibility to tell us that men suffer is not news many children know this and so do most adults to dream of a better world without moving toward that world is the right of adolescents but it is the bane and tragedy of mature men no it is not the reverend boyds of our generation who give me hope for the future for this kind of ministry discourages hope the battle is not being fought in the village or in the hippy section of san francisco it is being fought by a few silent souls struggling with their suburban congregations attempting to get across the real meaning of christianity and denocracy the young people on the hippy kick aside from a few lifekilling habits are trying to find themselves they will make it alone unless i am totally wrong there are many who are thankf ul for the boyds his kind of wretched jargon like prose and meaningless intentions this kind of ministry reassures the establishment that all is well and they need never fear no great threat to life limb or sacred habits will come from the hippy section the reverend boyds of the world are there if middle class america represents the strength and backbone of our nation then middle class america must accept a large part of the responsibility for what is wrong with america and on this score i refer to negroes and whitesfor the time has come when income will probably shape social attitudes just as surely as race of course this only means that negroes can go mad too and heap all the abuse they have suffered on others regardless of the criticisms that we make of the middle class it provides a large share of american leadership and so called opinion setters if we are to change social values in america we must start here to start anywhere else is to abandon the problem although it may be a special christian habit to exalt over the conversion of one soul it is a totally irrelevant act belonging to the personal realm what is threatening our very existence as a people and a nation are certain basic attitudes about our fellow men and ourselves it is meaningless except on a very limited personal level to speak of saving a few individuals all the angels in heaven may rejoice but it does not alter our foreign policy our racist attitudes our indifference to poverty and our grasp of what is happening in the world to convert a hippy deserves as much praise as it does to convertan episcopalian to a presbyterian the real conflict and struggle lie within the social attitudes and values that cut across all of these artificialreligious barriers reverend boyds free to live free to die ignores the real battlefield and the real enemy perhaps in fleeing the real challenge of his time he may find and save himself but little else will be salvaged n the prefatory pages of fine clothes to the j ew hughes explains the blues have a strict rhyme pattern one long line repeated and a third line to rhyme with

this ismine she explains to her patron still playing and se briefly tells the relation of this story to hughess life and to the cult of the negro can be passed over thematically it presents a conflict between life and art one that need not exist oceolas choices and actions tell us the blues are aligned mostly with life their source and the arbiter of their form art is here represented by a disciplined career devoted to old masters and old forms life by love and marriage and by immersion in duties to ones self and community art is associated with entrenched vealth life with youthful vigor art never transcends life embodied in dora ellsworth art merely offers from its hoard of cash the blandishments of convenience and privilege trying to draw away lifes vitality and induce it to f

aging vhite woman tells romantic tales of old france and out of her childhood love sings simple french tunes her husband never tried to understand the two sing together and mrs ellsvorth ventures to sing spirituals loneliness and unappreciated sensitivity then have wrought in this austere woman the certainty that what she lost a beautiful life can be found only in art art so good that it is better than most life and better therefore than most people hughes at twenty one knew that this concept was not true he tossed one form of art his books into the sea the closeness of the blues to sensory life appears in the unforced selectivity of oceolas mind as she summarizes her past for her patron she remembers mobiles delicious roast pig and the large mouth of billy kersands the minstrel leader who let her as a child place both hands inside it the relevance of negro experience to blues and jazz is the point in her recollection that her parents both musicians were run out of town for

enthusiast lover and concert artist keeps her fingers on the keyboard of life like the folk negro protagonist of evenin air blues she sees the secret of the blues in her own life and the truth of her expression will not be compromised her story shows that mans art is more viable because the oceolas and the dora ellsworths do not worship at the same temple jazz in the black and laughing heartbreaking blues and jazz of paris dawns in as hughes describes them in the big sea the young poet found his first prolonged incentive to tum jazz into poetry music at the grand due obviously inspired to a negro jazz band in a parisian cabaret in the crisis december but the source of his earliest jazz poem of unquestionable merit jazzonia the crisis august is less definite at all times after leaving mexico in however hughes responded to the music which lent its name to the this is the first half of jazzonia a poem apparently written a little after the weary blues and one of the three shown vachel lindsay it opens with an ecstatic union of sensory and spiritual faculties with vocalic suggestions both rapturous and solemn the next stanza gives dual recognition to the exotic thrust of jazz its then strange extravagance is drawn with cubist sharpness but kept expressively realistic through the picasso like image of the jazz mens six long heads massed and tilted its sexuality is colorfully emphatic in the enticing dancing girl allusions to eve and cleopatra add depth to the theme of allurement and several interchanges of adjectives before tree and rivers fuse the readers perceptions in apt anticipation of the concluding lines inawhirlingcabaretsix long headed jazzers play the other poem that impressed vachel lindsay negro dancers appeared in the crisis in march its vigor and rhythmical exactness are fully represented by the opening stanza spoken thu after a second stanza on the cabaret atmosphere of the brown skin steppers and a third that reads like two snaps of the thumb at white onlookers the poem ends with a repetition of the opening three lines except for the second stanza the poem is notable for its precise rendition of the dance that captured the verve speed and abandon of the jazz age and enthralled paris in the persons of many negro dancers especially josephine baker lenox avenue midnight the next published in the series of hughess best jazz pieces appeared in the weary blues recorded as the expressions of a negro womanit partially explainsjazz the rhythm of lifels a jazz rhythm the second stanza indicates that jazz like rain and street sounds can vaguely mirror human woes the final this poem a sof tly finger popping affirmation of life that makes the laughter of the gods somewhat irrelevant survives the effect of its middle which reflects a rather different consciousness and speech negroservantaddsapictureofjazzasdrumsoflifeinharlem after dark and salutes the music with o dreams songs saxophones at night elsewhere the poem evokes memories of african drums and veldt jazz is the after hours music of oppressed people o songs that do not care a repository of dreams and half buried recollections of a vibrant culture once theirs the meaning of jazz to the musician is combined with racial background in trumpet player in fields of wonder jazz is honeymixed with liquid fire and the trumpet player says the poet at the end never knows upon what riff the music slipsits hypodermic needleto his soul finally to the musician trouble mellows to a golden note the first third of the poem outlines the negro musician tired eyes smoldering with memories of slavery hair tamed down the weakest stanza shows the negros longing for the moon and sea as old desire distilled into rhythm the quoted lines and a few others reveal the true distillation jazz made precious by its long and sacrificial birth while writing trumpet player hughes was fully abreast of the new be bop music emerging from mintons playhouse in harlemamong the poems inspired by be bop a rhythmically complex and experimental kind of jazz characterized by dissonance improvisation and unusual lyrics the best is the lead off dream boogie in m ontage of a dream def erred keeping up with a changing harlem hughes is alert to the hip insiders elastic jargon as well as the generations old truth of negro life the dream deferred dream boogie perfectly fulfills its purpose wasting no word it has variation in mood ease irony sarcasm and terse jovialty it mixes old devices of the dramatic monologue with a contemporary boogiewoogie beat its rough hewn grace adds power to its clarity jazz poems can reveal jazz even less than blues poems can reveal the bluesthe strict form of the latter provides some agreement between poet and reader yet followers of bud powell dizzy gillespie thelonious monk and charlie parker can respond with extra enthusiasm and sureness to the be bop and jazz poems in the public alliance of poetry and music so challenging in the case of jazz poems hughes has been a pioneer on october he told harry elliott of the lawrence kansas j ournal world i did poetry reading with a jazz piano including fats waller in harlem friends homes in the early s his reading to glee club music at princeton in was part of a more public tradition that he was firmly establishing by then the greenwich village and san francisco beat movement of the late s was an extravagant development of hughess lead ifin his evolution as a poet shown in his volume hughes was restricting himself to folk material and to experimental and folk art methods a warning mixed with praise in reviews by saunders redding in new york h erald tribune book review march and by babette deutsch in the new york times book review may the restriction was purposeful restriction is the subject of the blues the fountainhead of jazz and the tuning fork of the negro soul a true blues or jazz poem is an expression of this very restriction modified by intimations of how negroes transcend it believe ill do a little dancinjust to drive my blues away and oh silver treeoh shining rivers of the soul are exact reflections of negro soul its supple power to overcome demoralization its gift of recognizing the flow of spirit inside kindred forms to be true the intellectual content of such poems must be aborted the lazy stomp of a jazz step and the sudden hey pop re bop interrupt the squash thought and reason in an irrational world of color prejudice for the folk negro to think is not to be negritttde the negroes own soul world that centralized hughess purposes in the s is the american counterpart of the burgeoning concept of african negritude launched in the following decade in the magazine black student and developed principally by two writers of african descent aime cesaire then at the ecole normale superieure and leopold sedar senghor the sorbonne student who was to become president of the republic of senegal african controversy over the term negritude will probably rouse an exploration of its american equivalent yet to be distinguished yet to be named this american negritude once defined and compared with the african personality and the black mans identity as phrases indicative of cesaire and senghor will remain traceable in the works of hughes its foremost exponent if american negritude can be tentatively defined as that complex of traits sensibilities and historical consciousness peculiar to black americans a study of hughess poetry alone can yield the outline of the concept the importance of skin color for example is revealed in negro me and the mule nightmare boogie and letter from spain his earliest soundings of this theme are serious respectful negro which appeared in the crisis in january and opened the weary blues identifies the negros darkness with the night and with the depths of my africa it gives negro color specific moral and physical strength dream variations manages to invest negro darkness with a fairyland grace and relaxed beauty in hughes expressed the world wide implications of this obvious kind of negritude his letter from spainaddressed to alabama the nine stanza poem quoted in part in chapter i opens with we captured a wounded moor todayhe was just as dark as me the versified letter shows the quickening bond of color that resolves differences between the dying african and his negro interrogator m ontage included nightmare boogie opening with the poets seeing a million facesblack as me his dream turns nightmare with a quizzical twist as the f aces all are suddenly dead white and boogiewoogie music is blaring a derisive razzing tone sharpens the anecdotal joviality and hardens the condemnation of color prejudice another component of negritude is related to skin color but not limited to it the sense of a particular beauty possessed by negroes the earliest printed poem on the subject is my people in the crisis june a six line piece which straightf orwardly declares the beauty of negroes faces eyes and souls but the earliest written poem on the subject is when sue wears red quoted in chapter i in which the sweetness of a brown faced girl wearing red is made both timeless and regal by references to ancient egypt and its queens the authors most sensuously conceived expression of this theme is harlem sweeties in shakespeare in harlem typical linesflow easilythe softly bouncing rhythmcarries different pulses of adoration the candy stocking eagerness of manhattan whites touring harlem cabarets and the keatsian rainbow abundance sensed at a negro beauty pageant an important trait encompassed by negritude is durability reflected by dilsey in faulkners the sound and the fury and emphasized by hughes all of his life mother to son in the crisis december begins the strong matriarchal portraits found in hughess poetry and fiction this poem using homely images like tacks splinters and tornup boards shows a poor negro woman instilling her own persistence into her son the same unconquerable determination imbues the negro mother which in furnished the name for a sequence of goldentair press broadsides decorated by prentiss taylor and marked by hughes with instructions for dramatic recitation the negro mother which drew a tearf ul platform embrace from mary mcleod bethune when hughes read it at her college shows how the speakers dream like steel in her soul and her faith in a free tomorrow for her races children have helped her endure mistreatment and exhort youngsters to march ever forward breaking down bars in the early s spirituals compares a negro mothers durability to the firmness of tree roots and mountains and still here asserts resistance to all attempts to make the negro speaker stop laughin stop lovin stop livin negro durability is elusive to the understanding as a psychic phenomenon and hughes waited till the middle decades of his career as a poet to explore it of the two poems in fields of wonder in which hughes makes this attempt burden shows almost mystically the psychic pang common to negroes oppression adds brief explicationthe dearth of dreamsfor dreamers songs for singers songs that will however break their jails three verses suggest the singing tension of nearness to the rational ideal so often shattered in interracial encounters into empty retrenchment or silent impasse clearer more admonitory lines appear in montage harlem asks what happens to a dream deferred and gives alternatives it dries up like a raisin in the sunfesters sugars over sags or does it explode ends the poem remembered partly as the source of lorraine hansberrys title for raisin in the sun harlem traces in figurative language the long scar of psychic abuse which might it emphasizesdevelopafatallyeruptive itch an expression of negritude important in the s is the recognition of african heritage hughess poems strongly voicing this heritage however belong mostly to the early years of his career about half were written or published in the early s during the ascendancy of marcus garvey whose weekly negro world extolled african history and whose black star line black madonna black baby dolls and revived backto africa

meaning of harlem dance hall in fields of wonder a farewell to african themes is implicit even in the title in afroamerican fragment in the crisis of july so longso far away is africa it begins and admits that only history books and african tunes in strange un negro tongue preserve memories of it hughess later role in perpetuating those memoriesisforeshadowed his final appro ch to negritude concerns negroes historical consciousness of their american past its best and its most detailed poetic expressions appear at opposite ends of a thirty year stretch of creativity in the chapter of the big sea named after the first line of the negro speaks of rivers hughes tells how and why in the summer of he wrote this perhaps most often anthologized of his poems one that is a boys testament of love for his race hughes newly aware of the spiritual strength of migrant southern negroes and feeling emotionally cast out by his estranged parents received melancholy inspiration from the sunset gold upon the mississippi he was crossing by train submerging that feeling into thoughts of mighty rivers in his ancestral past an having wrestled all day with the problem of hatred of negroes so vocal in the father who awaited him in mexico he reconciled his isolation in a river like fusion in which history became rebirth self justification and veiled prophecy the jines first written on the back of an envelope began the poem thus ive known rivers ive known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins my soulhas grown deep like the rivers i bathed in

publication of the very detailed prelude to our age several poems employ negro history october in op p ortunity in points to negro participation in john browns raid on harpeis ferry as does freedoms plow sometimes a single line appealing to negro historical consciousness transforms a poem the use of john henry with his hammer inflames the imagery of sparks and sundering crucial to love in shakespeare in harlem and just before prelude to our age hughes circles back to his obliquely autobiographical interest shame on you in phylon spring criticizes harlemites for not naming a building after j ohn brown dwarfing previous poems in its very purpose prelude to our age in branch library book news of the new york public library for october mentions over sixty persons known in negro history and related o ganizations and events negritude then referring to negroes various traits and sensibilities and emphasizing their feelings about their beauty durability and history defines itself in hughess works with as much clarity as the national mind brings to the concept basic details stark outlines nuances all are revealed they amass and enliven a tradition as much literary as sociological in its implications and a final aspect of negro soul is widely perceived though seldom fully comprehended humor according to hughess introduction to the best of n egro h umor even negroes especially writers and publishers often undervalue its uses hughess own uses of humor ample in his personal conversation and in much of his work can be only minimally surveyed in this approach to it in the light that it throws on negroes the combined uniqueness and utility of negro humor has long been its power to conceal and transform the uniqueness deriving from the magnitude and the persistence of the concealment the common theme of the mask then has an uncommon significance as expression of negro soul hughes labored early to express his sense of the tightness of the mask when minstrel man appeared in the crisis december a companion poem the jester appeared in op p ortunity only minstrel man discussed in chapter ii does justice to the theme the other poem is too plain an exhortation much later two poemsin one way ticket life is fine and juice joint northern city show how the authors more elastic humor moderates the grimness of the mask in the former poem the mask a shivering protestation that life is fi nefine as wine is clapped on by the speaker after his discovery that suicide in a cold river or from a high window is strenuous here the mask is fitted out of nonracial circumstances but the expression itself mixing blues and boogiewoogie style and italicized racial accent is negro juice joint uses the interruption of a blues song by a sudden dance step to keep the gall from biting in the singers mouth to show the snapping on of the mask af ter the adjustment the negro women using gestures precisely like those of the singer pearl bailey switch their skirts and lift their straightened headsto sing about the men whove done them wrongnot until the s did hughes b egin to publish a number of simply amusing or funny poems they show a vascular part in

have been after having two husbands she rather soured her life through lack of trust hard times have scratched into her memory that when you think you got bread its always a stone nobody lovesnobody for yourself alone the humor that enlivened the authors fiction at the start and increasingly marked his poetry of the s settled deepest in his prose one night in in a harlem gin mill near his st nicholas avenue address hughes received the most authentic comic inspiration of his life he overheard the man who was to become his own fictional jesse b semple explaining to a girl friend his job of making cranks in a new jersey war plant in reply o hughess question as to what the cranks cranked the negro worker shrugged i dont know what them cranks cranks you know white folks dont tell negroes what cranks cranks his notion of a separate white world his engagingly fresh diction while objecting to it became a study of the author during their many later bar stool conversations while hughes took boswellian notes after the conversations a literary character was being born who represented the flesh and spirit of harlem a folk hero sprung of the common black man he was a whole personality when hughes found himself arguing with him at the typewriter while the worker was miles away his vivid reality on paper now had the dimensions that would earn him full comparison to huck finn mr

sameautumn passing deals with aphenomenon tragic and humorous butthe humor of it did not show in hughess fiction until then at hollow hills farm he wrote another story of the same name derived almost exactly he said in conversation from an experience shared with aaron douglas and two or three other writers of the s published as whos passing for who in in negro story for december january the story recalls the harlem renascence night that an interracial group had some confused fun brawling meandering and ultimately guessing one anothers racial identities the humor is satirically aimed at the pretensions of the harlem literati and their white friends redheaded iowan stubblefield fightsfor a blonde struck by a negro only to find that she is the mans negro wife the other iowans negroes by their own gradual conf ession declare at the end from their cab were white we just thought wed kid you by passing for colored the negro writers are appropriately left at the curb throughout the story they have remained superciliously on the edge of the harlem stage that caught the imagination of white manhattan and faraway negro artists the writers snub everyone not privy to the mysteries of gertrude stein man ray and jean toomer they ignore the works of the previous generation even james weldon johnsons they too are passing and they know it well but negro soul as visible in the facts anecdotes and subtleties of passing is not revealedto any depth inaccessible to overt wit closely reading passing in the ways of white folks one sees much irony and anguish in this old american custom hughes finds comedy on harlems sophisticated sugar hill patron of the arts written not long before the spring of but first published in the langston h ughes read er tells the end of a love affair between a young oklahoma artist and a green eyed harlem charmer over twice his age in a typical scene darby reminds cornelia that her husband might interrupt them with firearms let him she cries first well mix a cocktail darby abstains seeing him speedily donning his coat she threatens suicide but she pours a drink for herself instead the humor is smart with embarrassed pose bright dialogue and tables turned hovever the story reveals little that is distinctive of negro spirit but the story has the most beautiful humanizing touch in hughess fiction cornelias final small note asking darby to take his painting of her back to oklahoma to remember how your patron looked transforrns her without it she would have been just another aging woman trying with cosmeticswardrobe cash and someone elsesinexperience and need to soften the hand of time with it she seems thoughtful and sensitive wishing for her young man no doubt in vain a return to the innocence of his drawing board she wants him to remember her in his maturity not as an older woman who lied about her age to be with him but as mrs oldham his patron who had some respect for art the works discussed in this chapter suggest the magnitude of the young hughess vision of his task as a writer they indicate the versatility of his spiral approaches to the negro soul life and love inside and outside the veil of color become subjects as wide as the authors sympathies yet as specific as artistic integrity alone can make them in every division and subdivision of topic that marks the boundaries chosen the author has produced work worthy of either admiration or respectful study in a tribute written soon after langstons death playwright loften mitchell touched on a part of the poet which i believe deserves particular emphasis it was his refusal to play the role of top negro or the literary house nigger he grew up in an age when the greatest accolade for a black man was to be the first negro this or that having won the mantle you were supposed to guard it zealously against any threat posed by other negroes working in the field you didnt actually hire someone to go out and shoot him down or crack a few ribs but in each prof ession there were appropriate techniques employed to keep the next soul brother down at a safe distance langston who had risen by long hard years of steady production knew how poverty stricken we were and how desperately we needed to fill the vacancies at the top and all along the line by everybody who had the talent to get there so he spent a disproportionate amount of his working lifewhich might have been devoted to self agrandizement helping young artists get a foot in the door i doubt if there are many black writers of my generation who did not on one occasion or the other use langston as a reference when applying for a fellowship or a foundation grant and i would suppose he holds the worlds record in writing letters in support of such applications langston even passed on assignments he might well have done himself although until recent years no black writer received more assignments than he could handle for example in the late s a prestigious national magazine asked him for an article on the numbers game in harlem not long before i had published my first novel which had to do with the numbers so langston said he was too busy and put my name forward as the expert he could have dashed off a better and more inforned piece in minutes but he knew i needed the money and the exposure there are many writers who had the same experience langston would not mind my saying that he was not the best critic in the world he felt such a deep commitment to the cause of black people everywhere that he found it terribly difficult to draw his literary razor against another brother he wanted us to get ourselves together i have lived several years in the africa he loved so much and i know that it now lies prostrate and despite all the trappings of national sovereignty and independence is being subjected to merciless rape by the white world largely because it has not got itself together in the arab israeli conflict as these words are written in june we have just witnessed a dramatic and tragic demonstration of what happens when one people are united and another are not here at home those of us who have managed to get before the public spend so much time tearing each other apart that it is refreshing to think of the splendid example our poet set all the days of his life he knew that the longer we kept at each others throats our real enemies would have nothing to worry about getting ourselves together this is one of the many lessons we should learn from the life and work of langston hughes on this page in the february issue of negro digest and on another page in the march issue of this magazine we called the attention of black writers to the fact that the national foundation on the arts and the humanities had granted for the publication of the first american literary antho logy the editor of this anthology george plimpton was delegated to select from the little literary magazines the works fiction poetry criticism essays which he deemed worthy of republication in the anthology each prose writer will receive and each poet will receive it is a way of course of rewarding talented writers whose work has not yet been recognized by the big slick magazines and the major foundations we warned black writers that since few of them are ever represented in the little magazines they would be effectively boycotted by the new anthologies we suggested that black writers who feel their work worthy of publication in such a government subsidized anthology write to the national foundation on the arts and the humanities and voice their objection to the method of selection of material for the anthologies at the same time we wrote to the director of literary programs for the national foundation on the arts and the humanities and inf ormed her that we considered the proposed anthologies discriminatory in their conception we pointed out that unless such magazines as liberator freedomways soulbook and black dialogue also were considered as sources for material for the anthologies black writers would be ex cluded from participation in the program yes under the circum stances we also listed negro digest as an important source for ma terial to be considered for the anthologies a few black writers did take the time to write to the national foun dation on the arts and the humanities to protest what would be inevitably the exclusion of black writers from a government subsidized project the response in washington however amounted to a sneer since the complaints were so few and so feeble there was no need to take them seriously well apparently the selections have been made for the first anthol ogy which will be published by farrar straus and giroux early in and there has been no confrontation petween the black writers and the people responsible for the anthology needless to say complaints are useless after the anthology has been published and now negro digest learns that has been granted for publication of the second american literary anthology with the same fr plimpton designated as editor so black writers have a second opportunity to voice their obje ctions to the eff ectivc exclusion of black writers from this government sub dized project will the black writers remain silent or will they speak up in chorus the address of the national foundation on the arts and the humanities is g street nw washington dc mrs carolyn kizeris director of literary programs we repeat the officials involved in the publishing project insist that there is no deliberate discrimination against black writers and tech nically this is true however none of the magazines classified as little are published by black people and black writers with the exception of ralph ellison james baldwin and occasionally saunders redding are rarely represented in the pages of the little magazines since this is a fact which can be proven it is our belief that the pub lishers of the government subsidized anthologies have the obligation to seek out the work of black writers and to give that work equal consideration with the work of writers white represented in the little magazines notes on writers and writing indianapolis

able direction of young dick gaffield oem counter poen is a tiny green jewel like booklet of lovely poems by dudley randall and margaret danner the idea of counterpoem means only that each respective page of poetry by mr randall is opposite a page of poetry by miss danner and that they sometimes reflect similar moods ideas and images as shown in the poems george and the patriarch and in the two belle isle poems all of the poems were carefully chosen which seems a very much more honest way to publish than that of choosing many poems of which only several are considered of merit afewofthe poems were quite well known before poem counterpoem was published among them are ballad of birmingham booker t and web by dudley randall and ill walk the tightrope and goodbye david tamunoemi west by margaret danner miss danners lovely poem a sparrow is a bird and mr randalls souvenirs and the southern road are beautiful poems which seem to reveal a lot about poetic craftsmanship and which as such southern road seems to have all the rich scorching loamy black vitality of the delta and the black belt and of miss danners variegated africa these following lines are from lr randalls poem the southern road to a land where shadowed songs like flowersswell and where the earth is scarier as a scar friezed by the bleeding lash that fell fell upon my fathers flesh f arfar f ar and deep my blood has drenched it none can bar my birthright to the loveliness bestowed upon this country haughty as a star and i set forth upon the south ern road most important of all f actors is that this book was publ ished by broadside press that is sign ificant for poets who are concerned aboutperhaps black_power also it is an off ering by two better know n black poets poem counterpoem sellsfor this does seem rather over priced are nsp r ng when one considers the fact that mr randalls sonorous lines in the southern road are rich in melody and in imagery and in idea it could be described as a protest poem if there were any such thing it has a great deal of power pain and despair the repetition of the line and i set forth upon the poetry is the orphan of the arts nevertheless for those who wish to read a lovely non commercial looking carefully made book of poetry poe counter poem can be ordered from broadside press old mill place detroit fichigan the title of the late langston hughes anthology the best short stories by n egro writers little brown implies a high degree of excellence that is if these are the best short stories by negro writers every one should be of extraordinary merit some of these have this quality others do not those that to me are outstanding in this collection are jean toomers fern zora neale hurstons the gilded six bits cyrus colters the beach umbrella ralph ellisons flying home yerbys health card gwendolyn brooks were the only colored people here james baldwins this morning this evening so soon mary elizabeth vromanssee how they run john a williams son in the afternoon william melvin kelleys the only man on liberty street woodie kings beautif ul light and black our dreams lebert bethunes the burglar and ronald milners junkie joe had some money these are outstanding because to me they deeply engaged the reader either through characterization incident or situation and even after reading they were not forgotten like froth that appears in a womans magazine but continued to reverberate in the memory their style was good and did not irritate through clumsiness flatness or imprecision jean toomer and woodie king were poetic and suggestive james baldwin was elegant and eloquent mary vroman was almost too sweet but the emotion came through gwendolyn brooks was sensitive and perceptive frank yerbys story was extremely powerf ul you forgot you were reading words you were there it would be a stand out in any collection ralph ellisons situation was strong despite straining after symbolism william kelley had a bare simplicity lebert bethunes story was almost too slick but it had a sus penseful f oreboding and it persisted in the memory ronald milners story had the loose rambling quality of some of the other childhood reminiscences but the nervous jagged style fits the situation of a child who stumbled upon a murder and the murderers and who all summer long ran here and ran there kn owing the murd erers were watching him incidentally this story junkie joe is not published here for the first time as stated in the acknowledgements it appeared years ago in a short lived magazine published by the henry brothers of michigan this is not to imply that the other stories were not good some however were clumsy in style some were slight and lacking in density of substance while others though strong in spots were not compelling all the way through others were simply forgotten after reading perhaps it is best to regard the collection as one showing the scope and variety of stories by negro authors all the stories are not on the race problem as one might assume some like arna bontemps a summer tragedy paule marshalls barba dos and alice walkers to hell with dying treat the themes of living loving and dying others like ernest gaines interesting treatment of folkways a long day in november conrad rivers mother to son and rudolph fishers miss cynthe reveal family relationships ronald fairs lusty miss luhester gives a party pearl craytons rollicking the day the world almost came to an end and alice childress biting the pocketbook game are humorous but kristin hunters an interesting social study charles wrights a new day and charlie russells quietus do depict racial relations and confrontations langston hughes has assembled in this book a plentiful assortment of short stories showing a wide range in theme treatment and quality although john a williams beond tle a ngry black cooper square publishers an expansion of his paperback the angry black may be compared to langston hughes best storiel by n egro a ilthors or john henrik clarkes n egro american short stories it differs from these in that it contains not only short stories but poetry and articles as well it is more like herbert hills melange soon one m orning but again it differs because it includes both black and white writers and supposedly has one theme black anger all the pieces however are not angry two poems by gwendolyn brooks and gloria oden show pride medgar evers and resignation man white brown girl although the third poem in the book margaret walkers now does express rage and indignation in the area of poetry this is like hills book in that the selection of poetry is skimpy being limited to three poems both editors apparently being unacquainted with or indifferent to negro poetry john howard griffins dark passage tells how white drivers picking up a black hitchhiker used the darkness and his blacknessto expose their own obscene fantasies about negroes james baldwin puts down the whitebroadway theater in theatre the negro in and out of itchester himes has a good article dilemma langston hughes has assembled in this book a plentiful assortment of short stories showing a wide range in theme treatment and quality dudley randall of the negro novelist in the united states in which he points out that the negro novelist must first find out who he is he is not an african for he has had the american experience af ter learning who he is his own people probably wont accept his work because it will be too painful for them kardiner and oveseys psychodynamic inventory of the negro personality describes both the lower and middle and upper class negro as suffering fron self hatred which he projects onto other negroes the lower class negro hates whites but fears to express his hate so turns it inward upon himself and onto other negroes the street corners and candy stores are scenes of vicious derogatory gossip because the mother is often head and breadwinner of the f amily he is confused about his sexual role his meager family life gives him little opportunity to learn affection and confidence in others even though he tries to effect relationsh ips with others by becoming a joiner he squabbles and tries to dominate his organizations one sees examples of this divisiveness in socalled negro leaders who criticize other leaders instead of helping them upper class negroes have a more secure f amily life but have in tense conflicts about status they want to be white and since thats impossible they hate themselves and everything black many for in stance take pride in not reading negro newspapers or magazines john a williams has an excerpt from a novel in progress navy black which vividly recreates the heat the sun the monotony and the sudden excitements of a base in the south pacific during world war ii as any pacific veteran can attest this is as well done as anything by mailer or james jones hoyt w fullers short story the apostle is full of felt life keen observation and subtle humor the character of the apostle has contra dictions which make him come to life in the pages and he acts in a way other leaders could emulate seymour krims article make it a white cadillac reveals the romantic attitude of whites toward harlem and the negro he is honest and con fessional and admits that even while tasting the excitements of harlem and letting himself be cheated and taken advantage of he still felt secu rity in his whitenessasfor exoticism it works both ways blacks also find something exotic and exciting in a white or lighter skin witness how many blacks who prate abou t the beauty of blackness wind up with a high yellow or white girl friend or wife mr williams warns that h ites have never shown reason in relation to race and blacks tired of having their reasonableness mistaken for weakness are about to give it up he pleads for a step beyond anger for reason before there is a holocaust and includes richard wright s prophetic plea from n ative son which published in is still pertinent today unfortunately he will not be heeded one of the first impressions you get after reading american n egro short stories hill and wang soft cover is that this anthology edited by john henrik clarke is really in keeping with the times what better time to bring to the fore a collection of short stories by black writers the political and social ferment of our times has created an unprecedented quest by black people for a true ac counting of their past if clarkes book did nothing else but contribute to that search by identif ying black storytellers and their works it would have achieved a measure of success however this anthology does that and more in the introduction clarke alludes to another achievement un til recently the contribution of negro writers to the development of the american short story has been sadly neglected true indeed the contributions of negroes to all fields of art and literature have been pathet ically neglected filling the informational gap in the short story field could be regarded as the books greatest success clarke brings together the stories of writers some like langston hughes w e b du bois and richard wright are established by whatever criteria you choose others are not the selections cover several literary periods two th century masters of the short story paul laurence dunbar and charles chestnutt are blended perfectly with authors of the negro renaissance and moderns like james baldwin and leroi jones equally important their works encompass various themes which scale the full range of emotions felt by black people in several centuries of racism in limiting each writer to one selection the anthology leaves itself open to criticism by reducing the giants to the level of the ordinary perhaps a broad survey that successfully lists the contributions of negro writers to the development of the american short story has to reach out and give equal space to the great the good and the ordinary more depth should be allowed though to men like chestnutt hughes and wright the major influences for lesser known writers in short the teacher deserves more space than the pupil still the book is thoroughly enjoyable dunbars the lynching of jube benson is an engrossing and tragic story of a simple and kind negro jube benson who is lynched for a murder he didnt commit be sides its realism the accourt is done in conventional language proving that dunbar could portray white characters with as much feeling subtlety and depth as he could negro folk characters in his more famed dialect poetry instead it is chestnutt often overlooked as a master dialecti cian whose the goophered grape vine is written in that medium though best known as a historian and social critic du bois is at his witty sharply satirical best in on being crazy a neatly woven tale of an unnamed character who confounds his racist detractors with teasing rationalizations in all aerican n egro short stories affords the reader both good entertainment and insight into the feelings of black people from some of the most qualified observers in november trident press published a first novel by a yearold los angeles girl named jane phillips the novel m oj o hand went almost unnoticed which is not strange for there are dozens of unremarkable novels published every season but what was strange was the novel itself a brief uneven apparently biographical tale of an attrac tive young peola possessed with an adoration for a blues singing guitar plucking black man a couple of worlds away from her california upbringing the almost plotless story is all but unimaginable in real life a girl still in her teens travels from los angeles across country to raleigh in search of a man whose music she has heard and loved her luggage includes a guitar which she plays herself when she gets blue and she gets blue often she finds the man in a routinely poverty stricken area of raleigh and moves in with him taking a job as waitress at peon wages in a rundown combination restaurant whore house everyth ing she has which the musi cian will take she gives him including her puny wages it is assumed that she cannot tear herself away from the man and his bed even when he boots her about like so much rubbage he is a god to her when he takes the instrument in his gnarled black fingers and croons in his plaintive voice all manner of her suffering is justified the girl called eunice moves like a somnambulist yielding unlovingly and unrespondingly to men who take herback in califomia she had lived in a middle class milieu but on her mystical journey she adjusts to a primitive life with no problem at all she demands nothing all that is important is that the man known as blacksnake is near her that the creator of the music she needs to hear is however tenuously attached to her there is no evidence that she loves him only that his being alive pro vides reason for her own efforts at survival she does not question she merely is much of the strangenessof mojo hand unquestionably lies in the authorsfailure oftechniquethere is never for exampleany explanation for eunices rejection of everything to seekout blacksnake andthere is no effort to justifya lovely young girls overwhelmingattraction for a physically unappealing and personally unadmirablefolksingerof apparently run of the mill ability how ever absenceoftechnique does not alone account for the almost weird quality of the novel eunice comes alive in the book but she alsocomes through as a fearfullypatheticcreature a child woman already stripped of emotionand devoidof either ambition or a sense of values she wears her life like a looseuntidy garment however janephillips makes up with soulfor whatever she lacks in novelistic technique and development the down at the heelsquality of the towns inwhich her characters move isevoked with thebarestde scription and the words and the be havior of her characters never waver fromthemarkthe world in which euniceseeks out herdrab destiny is flat and cold and rarely touchedby hope sex is easy and liquor runs free and violence lurks and yel there is everywhere a basic sort of kindness and freedom a willingness to confront life as it is a wisdom born of knowing the measure of man and where inevitably man ends toward the middle of the novel eunice tires of blacksnakes abuse of her and packs her battered bag she journeys as far as lake charles before changing her mind and starting back in search of him in lake charles she goes to bed with a gi on leave but does not respond to him the soldier insists on following her back to raleigh and on to south bay where blacksnake has gone to live with another woman she moves in with the estranged wife of blacksnakes buddy now she is heavy with blacksnakes child there waiting she becomes a part of the dockside society of whores stevedores and villagers she finally chases away the soldier who loves her in the end eunice abandons south bay but she does not return to her home and family in california she makes her way back to the crumbling cabin where blacksnakes ancient mother lives alone the old woman accepts the pregnant girl and the books action is over that in any case is a kind of affirmation a decision whatever its meaning but the strangeness of the novel remains the symbolism haunts confusing and indistinct the emphasis on folk music inexpertly done seems in retrospect to have been gratuitous and while eunices choice is baffling it has a logic which grows out of her inexplicable obsession perhaps after all that is enough still jane phillips has produced a work just disturbing enough just provocative enough to make the reader curious as to whether here is an unusual new talent at hand or whether just possibly it all was a kind of desperate catharsis hwf then ilast saw langston hughes he was r off again on one of ge those endless odysseys up to our expectations of what a poet should be even in that segregated school our models for literature and success were white and we were led to believe that a poet could only be white tall with blue eyes and a shock of long black wavy hair we read emerson bryant wordsworth and coleridge and modeled our images of what a poet should be like upon the patterns presented to us by our teachers no place had been set aside in our world for a hughes and to read his poetry and though we were amused and ento make a little of that money which people always assumed erroneously that he had i first met him on such an odyssey he had traveled to our high school in virginia read his poetry and chatted with students and teachers though to my knowledge none of us had ever met a real live poet beforehughesin no way measured couraged by him still we felt somehow betrayed f or a negro poet was as alien to our comprehension as a negro president yet he stayed with us for a short time laughing talking and assuring and then he was gone and we went back to emerson bryant wordsworth and coleridge he was the only negro poet who ever came to us and though none of us realized it at that time he destroyed something fundamental within us despite what our teachers told us emerson bryant wordsworth and coleridge would never again have the same eff ect upon us for though ve had excluded hughes from our minds shut him out like some oedipus still that distorted image of what constituted a literary figure was tarnished if not com pletely negated some time after his visit many of us turned to negro literature for the first time to poems by mckay hughes johnson and dunbar to novels by wright redding himes and fauset at each point of awareness we became a little more embittered by the assumption that our elders had made about us of our eagerness to accept their models withou t benefit of a personal choice we became even more disheartened because there was a world of ours which was so alien to us which had been carefully hidden from us by those who should have been instrumental in revealing it to us in that world were people who shared so many of our own experiences hopes and desires and yes our own anguish and pain the rivers of which langston hughes sang were more real to us than those of limpid blue crystalline streams which flow through so much of english and american poetry the yearning for das fl ie gende stunde the fleeting hour of fulfillment in a world which promised nothing but chaos confusion and death that yearning so peculiar to the literature of the western world was for us most profoundly expressed in hughes johnson and mckay and no poet neither a bryant nor an arnold would ever vouchsafe lines to us which portrayed our feelings of pessimism despair and fear so well as those of langston hughes we cry among the skyscrapers as our ancestors cried among the palms in africa because we are alone it is night and were afraid four months ago at a party given by a mutual friend i attempted to impart some of this to hughes beaming as usual a bright smile lighting up his tired face he listened half heartedly and jokingly emitted some words of thanks perhaps i did not completely get through to him it is difficult to pra ise a man to his face without becoming sentimental but moreover it is difficult to tell a writer that his writing not only made you think not only inspired you not only encouraged you but in addition gave you that strong silent strength which only words can give to one who must face a stronger and noisier world and again it is difficult to tell any human being that his words made visible to you a new universe aglow with promise and hope but perhaps he would not have believed me for years critics had said that he was a simple poet a folk singer a mere teller of tales lacking inprofundity and complexity the message he carried the songs he sang devoid of pathos energy meaning and direction he was a negro poet who could not get beyond hisnegritude and thus they said he could never journey to the universal paradise where the aspirations of men soar far beyond race creed and color like richard wright hughes too was a negro writer and like wright he never denied it therefore readers black and white allowed his books to gather dust on bookshelves to lie untouched upon library shelves across the country from his writings from his public lectures from his private conversations that enthusiasm that love for the people so dostoyevskian in its intensity pervaded everything that he said and for this reason he was like wright an alien a lonely man invisible in the literature of that country which he loved so well and of which he sang so eloquently his was the fate of the negro writer people who knew him by name managed to get his autograph never read his poetry critics who read his writings did not understand it and therefore dismissed it as worthless high school teachers who rushed to any gathering to come into contact with him never taught his poetry to their students middle class negroes who loved to have him a great conversationalist as an invited guest at their suburban affairs never read his poetry aloud to their children the colleges of this country their english departments in particular which have exalted robert burns dismissed hughes completely uttering their synony m for negro writerssimple he has remained alive in literature not because people read what he wrote few have but because of his frequent excursions into towns and hamlets bringing with him in his own humble way the message of a people and yet these tireless excursions these endless odysseys robbed him of that vitality that youth which may have enabled him to last a few years more when i said goodby to him for the last time he was on his way to the university of california a university whose english department would never include a poem of his in its syllabus for american literature to lecture and to read his poetry he was already an old man and the age showed even beneath the spontaneous laughter and youthful joy which attempted to buttress it at a time when white poets and writers of his stature had retired to their estates become seers and honored prophets of literature he was embarking upon yet another odyssey because at sixty five he did not have the not even those he sang so long and so passion ately had rewarded him for all of his long years his endless devotion the negro wrote richard wright is americasmetaphor and langston hughes is the metaphor for the negro writer far more than his poetry his novels his plays and his countless lectures his treatment by the academic establishment is the best example of what it means to be a negro writer in america and in many ways he was more fortunate than most for his name among those of my generation if not a household word is known and respected yet like other rewards posterity will more than likely escape him those footprints which he etched upon the sands of time viii be wiped away no trace left of their imprint barring a mad dash for his books now that he is dead a dash which might have helped to keep him alive in but a short span of time even his name like that of cullen toomer and locke will be unknown to any but those who prepare dissertations negro renaissance the high schools and colleges which denied him in life will continue unless something radical happens to americas educational system to deny him in death and thereby to doom him to extinction f or unfortunately literary figures are kept alive in our high schools colleges and universities another generation of negro youngsters there ore will not be as fortunate as those of my generation will have no choice but bryant emerson wordsworth and coleridge this is the tragedy of america and it isthis which causesthe pain the anguish and the despair voiced by the negro intellectual in the cry for black_power we are denied our own heroes our own prophets our own songsters because of a group of narrow minded insecure little men have determined a priori that such songsters prophets and heroes are not good enough in english departments across this nation both black and white the shroud is wrapped securely around the corpse of the negro writer perhaps they are right perhaps as they argue langston hughes was not a great poet perhaps he carried no message of profundity perhaps his was a simple world unlike and this will come as a surprise to many critics that world of jesse b semple perhapsand yet these are observations which no small group of men should be allowed to make arbitrarily value judgments which should at best be made in concert with those who will be the beneficiaries of the judgment instead critics black and white dismiss the negro writer hand down arbitrary judgments concerning himin the same fashion in which hugheshas been arbitrarily dismissed on the college campuses of america hughes was a negro poet and theref ore inconsequential he was a poet of his people and despite robert bumsjohn millington synge and william butler yeats a poet should not be a poet of a particulargroup of people but of all the people he wrote of drunken negroes of sad negroes of happy negroesof confused negroes in the same veinin whichjohngay wrote of englishmen with similar characteristics yethughes but notgaywasac cused of writing oftrivial things like wordsworth and bums hughes language was meant to be the languageof the people yet unlike his mainstream prdecessorshis verse was labeledsimple yet most negroes know that his verse was not simple neither was hislife he lived the role of the greatesttragedian on any stageand throughout his writing forthe life that he lived that life of joy sometimes and sorrowsometimesisthe life that mostnegroes live few can give voice to their anguish and despair as hughes wasable to do none can so adequately justify the ways of negroes to the world as hughesdoes so well in all of his writings none can keep him safe for posterity for negroes are powerlessto do so against the army of academicians who wait like vultures to dismember his corpse still further his reputation as the poet of the people cannot be kept alive in a world which seeks as we rush faster toward the armageddon of integration to negate the people all that one can do is to remember that there once lived a writer proud to be a negro writ er who never disowned either his heritage or his people a poet who came before us lived amongus and died this is no doubta sim ple commentary upon the life of so beloved and sogenerous a man and yet a commentary undeserving of many of todays writers who have f ound a haven among the english departments in our best universities because asthey point out so vociferously they are not negro writers but american writers in school a fellow english major asked me to read aloud for poems of langston h ughessilce i had acted in a numbr of campus plays late into the night with what turned into a whole room full of students we read and read over again the poems of mr hughes one favorite verse being lulu said to leonard i want a diamond ring leonard said to lulu you wont get a goddam thing this one we felt to be daring enough a shock of defiance for the staid presbyterian walls of knoxville college the next day lulu and leonard were dorrnitory characters it was later and through dr rosey e pool that i happened to meet mr hughes after her visit to the campus she suggested that i write to him and send along some poetry i did and received a reply which was an inspiration far greater than lulu and leonard laterinnew york ifinally met him he was more earthy and warm than ever i could have imagined the occasion was a party to celebrate his acceptance of the spingam award after such a meeting how could anyone re member langston hughes in any manner other than one of gratitude love and warm respect for his gentle person his humor and quality of the completely genuine istillremember his coming over to me and asking what are you having to drink having come recently from the black belt and being in complete awe of s i n i said coca cola he looked at me in his smiling manner and replied a writer cant make it on coca cola it was spoken with the impact of humor i grew to know in him but i could feel the seriousness imbedded within his statement during the party iexpressedmy wish to become an actress a famous actress spoke of the marvels of the stage and said it was a splendid idea and that i should really consider it that writers should be and often were capable dramatists i was thrilled later aswe made our way toward a theatre to hear another writer read from his latest i was enthralled with the idea wouldnt myformer drama director be glad to know his faith inme would be confirmedwouldnthebeproud quietly so that only i could hear theformerlyradiant actress said in an agonized voice forget t its a dogs life follow a professionwhere youllbe able toeat stunned i later asked mr hughes why the lady had added this spirit dampening bit of news dont think hard of her he said she was on an actress is always on every group is her audience every audience is her public she was on what the hell was on he was always most patient with me when people refer to him as a great poet they should add to that great human being for he was the greatest in my keeping are books and cards at many seasons and occasions from mr hughes he never forgot me not as a poet not as a person he respected the efforts of younger poets last october i heard him read at the guggenheim museum two weeks later in the hospital his flowers and cards arrived at christmas and new years other cards arrived from langston hughes whose love for life and for people will be remembered and cherished by many for there are others who can no doubt recall as lovely memories near his door at th street he grew ivy someone did it was the only flowering on the whole street and now i think who will grow the ivy or see that it is there he continued to help the younger poets even through the political discrediting and over the so called gulf of generations he was a fine man a beautiful brilliant and loving man was langston hughes we younger poets are in tum the budding new green of his ivy it is an unfortunate commentary indeed that so many times we fail to realize comprehend the true value breadth scope influence of a person only until after that person has gone from us irrevocably i par tially must admit some guilt in this respect in relation to langston after his passing it fell upon me like a ton of bricks that even though i had known him called him friend that actually i knew little of him about him i had once owned the big sea but had not read it before it got away from me as books do after his passing i borrowed a copy of his second biographi cal volume i wonder as i wander and took it and the langston h ughes reader along with me on a short trip both i read from cover to cover and thus became re acquainted with known facts of langstons life and delighted with the discovery of little known facts had i read previously about his travels my own might have been richer and deeper the fine sensitive creative human being that langston was was brought home to me sampling the read er i savored his poems prose blues plays essays and speeches what depth what versatility what sin cerity what a rare creative soul was langston surely a model superb for all of us who endeavor to create to emulate i first had the honor of meeting langston in the early thirties when we of the negro peoples theatre put on his dont you want to be free at abraham lincoln center he came to smile at and encourage us fledgling thespians then years later with a similar company some of us appeared in his the sun do m ove at parkway house on fifty first street i understudied the role of a strong black woman who stood behind her man against oppression langston saw me play the role and said he thought it was quite good like he had written it of course that endeared him to me however i grew closer to him through my reading of his poems such as ive known rivers the negro mother i too sing america let america be america again and many others which were watchwords for the protest movement of the time in retrospect i find that i am have been most impressed with langstons unselfishness and the con sistent encouragement that he gave to all who endeavored to create to langston it was come on in the waters fine come let me help you theres plenty of room up here tell me what i can do to help you this and much more langston re sponded to our efforts to start an african american museum in the midwest in a real way by sending money artif acts books programs clippings and a rare item his christening robe and cap finally the man the poet james mercer langston hughes will always be loved and remembered by the plain people black and white for he spoke their our language yes he always leveled with us and we certainly did dig him langston hughes lives the young art st whose drawingsare reproduced on these pages is a star example of the caliber of talent resident in the black
