in truth the hopes of the great society have been overcome by the fears and frustrations of vietnam the pursuit of this widened war has narrowed domestic welfare programs making the poor white and negro bear the heaviest burdens both at the front and at home the antipoverty program is cautiously initiated zealously supervised and evaluated for immediate results while billions are liberally expended for this illconsidered war the recently revealed misestimate of the war budget amounts to  billion for a single year this error alone is more than five times the amount committed to antipoverty programs the security we profess to seek in foreign adventures we will lose in our decaying cities the bombs in vietnam explode at home they destroy the dream and possibility for a decent america if we reversed investments and gave the armed forces the antipoverty budget the generals could be forgiven if they walked off the battlefield in disgust poverty urban problems and social progress generally are ignored when the guns of war become a national obsession when it is not our security that is at stake but questionable and vague commitments to reactionary regimes values disintegrate into foolish and adolescent slogans it is estimated that we spend  for each enemy we kill while we spend in the socalled war on poverty in america only about  for each person classified as poor and much of that  goes for salaries of people who are not poor we have escalated the war in vietnam and deescalated the skirmish against poverty it challenges the imagination to contemplate what lives we could transform if we were to cease killing   america is a great nation but in this war she seems bent on her destruction through rugged and dazzling achievements america has become the richest and most powerful nation in the world we have built machines that think and instruments that peer into the unfathomable ranges of interstellar space we have built gargantuan bridges to span the seas and gigantic buildings to kiss the skies through our airplanes and spaceships we have dwarfed distance and placed time in chains and through our subways we have penetrated oceanic depths this year our gross national product will reach the astounding figure of billion all of this is a staggering picture of our great power but honesty impels me to admit that our power has often made us arrogant we feel that our money can do anything we arrogantly feel that we have everything to teach other nations and nothing to learn from them we often arrogantly feel that we have some divine messianic mission to police the whole world we are arrogant in not allowing young nations to go through the same growing pains turbulence and revolution that characterizes our history    we arm negro soldiers to kill on foreign battlefields but offer little protection for their relatives from beatings and killings in our own south we are willing to make the negro  per cent of a citizen in  warfare but reduce him to  per cent of a citizen on american soil of all good things in life the negro has approximately onehalf those of whites of the bad he has twice that of whites thus half of all nev groes live in substandard housing and he has half the income of whites when we turn to the negative experience of life the negro has a double share there are twice as many negroes in combat in vietnam at the beginning of  and twice as many died in action  per cent in proportion to their number in the population as whites all of this reveals that our nation  has not yet used its vast resources of power to end the long night of poverty racism and mans inhumanity to man enlarged power means enlarged peril if there is not  concomitant growth of the soul genuine power is the right use of strength if our nations strength  is not used responsibly and with restraint it will be following actons dictum power that tends to corrupt and absolute power that corrupts absolutely » our arrogance can be our doom it can bring the curtains down on our national drama ultimately a great nation is a compassionate nation we are challenged in these  turbulent days to use our power to speed up the day when every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain let me say finally that i oppose the war in vietnam because i love america i speak out against it not in anger but with anxiety and sorrow in my heart and above all with a passionate desire to see our beloved country stand as the moral example of the world i speak out against this war because i am disappointed with america there can be no great disappointment where there is no great love i am disappointed with our failure to deal positively and forthrightly with triple evils of racism extreme materialism and militarism we are presently moving down a deadend road which can lead to national disaster    those of us who love peace must organize as effectively as the war hawks as they spread the propaganda of war we must spread the propaganda of peace we must combine the fervor of the civil_rights movement with the peace movement we must demonstrate teach and preach until the very foundations of our nation are shaken we must work unceasingly to lift this nation that we love to a higher destiny to a new plateau of compassion to a more noble expression of humaneness   
in october  a year after the forma i i tion of the cardozo area arts committee the new school for afroamerican thought was opened and celebrated with a weekend of music drama and art that attracted guests and performers not only from the washington area but also from cleveland pittsburgh new york city and philadelphia  within the year they had been organized the committee had held several fund raising efforts became incorporated and rented and decorated a storefront building for classes in art negro history dance basic education music and tutoring services for the neighborhood children the school located in the heart of the cardozo ghetto is managed by a board of directors composed of residents of the area the idea for the school came from gaston neal a poverty program worker who believed that the residents would participate in cultural programs if they could have their own facilities and could have a hand in planning their own programs while the new school is located near howard university which offers many cultural advantages neal felt that the people in the ghetto would not feel comfortable at howard members of the ninemember board and their friends contributed labor and services to cut the cost of making the building fit for use as auditorium classrooms and offices the twostory building once housed an auto repair shop the concrete floors of the main floor were painted battleship gray the back of the stage a slidomatic garage door is painted yellow and is used to bring in and take out large pieces of equipment and musical instruments for the opening artists loaned paintings a piano was borrowed and an announcement was made during the opening program that many items were needed and those wishing to make contributions could do so the director gaston neal  is a neighborhood worker for the united planning organization the poverty program organization in washington d c he was born and grew up in pittsburgh and dropped out of school in the ninth grade when a school teacher told him he should take a trade rather than aspire to be a writer for playing hookey and breaking some street lights neal was committed to a reformatory for  months many of the times

until four in the morning at  he tried to enlist in the army but was turned down at  he went into the army and learned practical nursing at walter reed army hospital in dc while in the army neal did a lot of reading and began to also do some writing he absorbed the works of langston hughes and richard wright and began writing about the negro gradually he drifted into writing prose poetry after the army he went back to pittsburgh and took odd jobs such as portering or washing dishes for the past  years neal has lived in washington and boston as well as in pittsburgh associating with people who are interested in writing music drama dance and art in boston he made friends of harvard students and by listening and reading picked up knowledge beyond his formal junior high school training it was out of this background that gaston neal joined other neighborhood workers and residents whose interests were similar they banded together in the cardozo arts committee spurred by neals drive enthusiasm initiative and ability the group was incorporated organized such events as a weekend of soul and a sale of neighborhood art works when the new school of afroamerican thought opened in washington the cinder block and brick walls were freshly painted and a sympathetic mixed audience half white and half negrowas in attendance the house was crowded to capacity gaston neal greeted the

today over onequarter million negroes are  attending colleges and  universities in this  country nearly twothirds of these are enrolled in  predominantly negro institutions located in the south and border states  are privately supported the remainder or  are taxsupported in the main these institutions now house the negro leadership of tomorrow it is from these that one would expect to come tomorrows martin_luther_kings roy wilkenses stokely carmichaels and floyd mckissicks however such a possibility is remote for negro college students have become apathetic to the cause as a negro college professor put it recently they are more interested in their fronts suits wheels cars and skins degrees than they are in the voting rights of negroes in mississippi and alabama in fact the negro campus has become a bastion of conservatism although the students wear their hair au naturel and go to hear stokely carmichael when he comes to campus they are in the main most concerned about getting ahead this means holding down a good job attending negro fraternity and sorority dances and carnivals in downtown hotel ballrooms and living quietly in black suburbia away from all that jazz about civil_rights they merely put in time in college knowing that if they play their cards right they too can live in black suburbia the majority do not want to run the risk of being kicked out of college because of their participation in activist rights programs they have seen what happened to fellowstudents and professors who spoke up ousted students are back home working at menial jobs and the profs many of whomespecially at the height of the civil_rights movement had to leave overnight their teaching posts in southern colleges are in the case of good ones teaching in liberal white institutions in the north or in the case of marginal ones teaching in high schools in the nations ghettos thus wouldbe campus radicals have gotten the message and fast the profs cannot run the risk of losing their expensive homes in black suburbia by participating in civil_rights activities in fact many college presidents encourage new professors to buy homes as soon as possible once they arrive on campus in this way the administration can more easily control their activities in visiting atlanta baton rouge knoxville and baltimore just to mention a few cities where major negro colleges are located one is struck by black college enclaves in which there are homes to be had ranging from  to  on racial matters residents of these  of white legislators or benefactors for support of institutions which they head thus negro college professors have contributed to student apathy on campuses where they teach for some time now it has been recognized that negro leadership has typically been classified into two polar types of behavior accommodation and protest undoubtedly the largest accommodational group in this country is composed of negro college professors while many of them identify strongly with the race at least in privacy their espousal of the negro cause is academic in general they tend to have values similar to those of the white middleclass stronger desires to associate with whites more internalization of negative attitudes toward other negroes and relatively weaker ethnic identification than individuals in lower status positions in the south they like whites have a vested interest in segregation they boast of their nice homes swimming pools and foreign trips while simultaneously criticizing other negroes for acting like niggers in atlanta for example the negro class structure is as rigid as the racial structure upperclass negroes and college professors are generally considered in this category among negroes whose economic security has depended on the white community have accepted discrimination though utilizing in many cases their positions to avoid cruder forms of  racial discrimination thus they enjoy a life of ease behind the segregated curtain because they are protected from having to compete with whites the outsiders having accepted so completely their way of life they often feel that it is foolhardy for other negroes not to strive for what they havea nice home in segregated suburbia and a solid place in black society it is understandable that teachers directly or indirectly contribute to the placidity of their students although they are surrounded by social injustice their lectures remain enervate and purblind the student who challenges them is often referred to the counseling center for social adjustment the nice quiet respectful and conservative student is the one who gets the as and ultimately the diploma so proper is the negro college professor that he is literally afraid to take a stand on civil_rights perhaps this is understandable in the south where negro colleges are controlled by white conservatives andor liberalsboth from the north and the southon whom the private colleges depend for contributions more difficult to comprehend however is the behavior of college professors at such universities as howard where ehomes are as conservative as the whites who control their lives through the college presidents who must depend directly or indirectly on the goodwill franklin frazier the late noted sociologist worked for many years while he was acclaimed internationally especially for his book the black bourgeoisie he was persona non grata not only on his own campus but on negro campuses throughout the country in his book dr frazier analyzed the pastimes and interests of the black middleclass in america he therefore caused much consternation among negro intellectuals in general when the book came off the american press in  a noted sociologist who at that time was at southern university in baton rouge louisiana was so infuriated that he avowed to go right out and write a book refuting everything frazier had said to this day however his book has not been heard of following in fraziers footsteps is a young chicago university phd nathan hare also now at howard his book the black anglosaxons has created so much furor that he now reports that he is in danger of losing his professorship at the nations most outstanding negro university another negro scholar said that he hoped dr hare will not fritter away his career in contentions over this mass of controversial irrelevances on this score it is interesting to note that white faculty members at negro colleges are given considerable freedom to analyze the negro problem but when a negro professor on the same faculty attempts to do the same he is usually repri manded and runs the risk of being booted out as a troublemaker this is probably why today most of the scholarship on the negro is being written by whites not negroes frequently a few students will take up for their favorite professors who tell it like it is but the college administrators retort that the professors are not there to create racial upheaval but to teach that is teach like it is from the book which is generally written not to be offensive to anybody negro college students are also responsive to the demands of their parents mothers and fathers save and scrape to send their children to college to get book lamin they want them to come back home and be somebody therefore parents take a dim view of sons and daughters who get kicked out of college for getting mixed up in civil_rights actually parents are not always thinking for themselves for it is a known fact that white employers are often instrumental in financing in part at least negro youths in college were it not for mothers washing and scrubbing to send black youth to college many would not be able to go stokely carmichael relates often how his mother worked as a maid in long island for  a week to send him to college and how the white lady for whom she worked wanted him a bright colored boy to go to college in the south many of the negro students come even today from sharecropper farms when the landowners discover that their tenants sons and daughters are causing trouble in college they will see to it that times get hard for the parents it is not just professors and parents who indoctrinate negro college students with conservatism perhaps the most influential in this area are the college presidents themselves in addition to controlling the profs they also have a significant influence on their student bodies in the main the negro college is a small institution ranging from  to  students with the average enrollment being slightly over  on such a campus the president has frequent and close contact with the students often he walks through the halls of classroom buildings in the way of high school principals whom students have known back home he the president of a churchrelated or statecontrolled college or university reminds students constantly that they must be ladies and gentlemen above all this means dressing in sundaygomeeting clothes for dinner and staying off the streets like common negroes essentially he is more interested in his students being proper than he is in their learning to think for themselves ? during sunday convocations and wednesday evening vespers he admonishes students to lead a good life this means being men among men in other words he tells them that they must go out into  an integrated society where the color of a mans skin doesnt matter that people are accepted according to what they are not who they  are recently one college president advised his students to give « up some of their soul ethnic identification if they wanted to be fully accepted in the american society this he said means learning to think talk and act like other americans  significantly adults are not the only purveyors of apathy among negro college students today on a broader scale one might say that  the total society has shaped the negros whole attitude toward his j existence as a human being in our j society as a member of a society characterized by discrimination the student although negro the subject of discrimination cannot see or understand the wrong that  is being done him thus he cannot see he does not accept the propo i sition that negroes in this country suffer injustices because they happened to have been born black j in general the negro students world view is limited by tunnel j vision and egocentricism when asked why he is in college his reply is apt to be that he wants to make a better life for himself in contrast the african student when asked the same question generally  relates his being in college to going back home to help his people last summer a young liberian studying economics at the university of wisconsin explained that my specialization is fundamental to help mg my people realize our national goals in other words the negro student like the american society as a whole is materially oriented whereas the african student is politically or nationally oriented differences in purposes for being in college make for strained relationships between negro americans and africans in this country it is because of these differences that americans and negro americans do not relate well one to the other on our college campuses a student from ethiopia reported recently that american negroes never have anything interesting to talk about about african students one american negro retorted that he gets tired of talking about politics all the time it appears that the tense relationship existing between black africans and their american counterparts may be attributed to what the africans perceive as indifference to social injustice on the part of the negro traditionally africans have sought to repeal and counteract injustice in a direct manner when they see american negro students laughingly going about their merry way and indeed seldom discussing intently the american dilemma they are somewhat dismayed to say the least apathy is also a result of racial separatism on the one hand and racial inclusion on the other socially the negro remains exclusive while simultaneously being a part of the total culture in which he lives his major ideas and attitudeshis weltanschauung if you willcome from the total culture not just his subculture in essence then he is driven to demand social changes when the total society promotes or initiates or at least provides an atmosphere for such a demand in the meantime his emphasis is on personal change not group  that is subgroup  change thus the individual student is interested in what he can do to improve his life not the life of his people as is the case with most african students whom he encounters on american campuses often this attitude is perpetuated through lack of acquaintance with vital issues which is obtained through staying abreast of social problems and alternatives to stay abreast of relevant issues is to stay in touch with ones immediate and current environment this means reading the daily papers and keeping up with the melange of social issues which affect our daily lives individuals who are acquainted with their history and know how it relates not only to their position individually but to the position of their race in general are the ones who are in tune with their immediate environment this implies that students who read and think about things which are not presented in their classrooms by their professors are far ahead of those who sit like buckets waiting to be filled thus in the final analysis the blame for apathy on the negro campus cannot be laid directly at the feet of any person or persons but the student himself so long as students remain passive listeners to impetuous speakers of the stokely carmichael ilk so long as they evaluate activist speeches as entertainment so long as they refuse to accept these as calls for action they will remain passive observers they will remain bystanders to what is happening around them and in so doing they will remain as a segment of the negro population the lumpenproletariat those who are least capable of engaging in concerted action to improve their lot in the meantime the struggle for civil_rights will undoubtedly be carried on by the present but limited number of young activists these in the main are dropouts or kickouts from southern and northern  colleges for example during the summer of  about onethird of the activists engaged in voter registration activities throughout the south were for the most part dropouts from white colleges and universities in the north and a handful who had attended negro colleges before becoming disenchanted with their campus existence others were jobless individuals who had latched on to the movement to find a place for themselves one young man a philosophy major at anderson college had been with the movement for three years either with sclc or a related group he reported that he had been offered a scholarship to continue his education but thought he would rather stay at his work in the south besides he had made a lot of friends while in the movement one of these a young blonde about  he introduced as having been a student at mount holyoke    how long the present group of young and sometimes crude and often undisciplined radicals can continue to carry the activist push for civil_rights by themselves remains to be seen how long they can withstand negative reactions to their aweinspiring slogans solicits speculation from present indications it seems safe to say that unless negro college students become socially involved and sensitive to the fulfillment of these rights leadership of and direction to the civil_rights movement will revert to whites in essence whites will determine what the goals of the movement shall be the chances of future martin_luther_kings roy wilkinses and stokely carmichaels coming forward to replace those already on the line will be nil
recent events in africa have shown that something went wrong  § not only with the body p iic y  f that continent but also with the ideology and the philosophy on which the african continents commitment to total freedom was founded men of goodwill who are interested in the future of africa and the welfare of the africans will agree that at this critical moment of human history africans ought to trace back their locus and reassume the beliefs and values that displayed their toga virillis and sounded the death knell of foreign domination they will also agree that the blessings of human and ethnic diversities have to be fully exploited if africa is to survive the second half of the twentieth century oddly enough many of the socalled african experts are postulating that tribalism and its intensity in africa are functions of education and that the more educated the african the more tribalistic he becomes this of course is a superficial generalization and total nonsense however we cannot deny the fact that some educated and corrupt africans tend to exploit the ethnic diversity in africa for their own selfish ends these selfish and unpatriotic demagogues have been partly repudiated by the present disruption in some parts of africa they will be totally disgraced when africans return to the philosophy that in part led to the political emancipation of africa this is the philosophy of zikism which as a package contains all the drugs that are capable of curing the present african illness and conglutinate all forces working for the good of africa zikism forms the core of what its exponents called renascent africa and is grounded on five postulates  spiritual balance  social regeneration  economic determination  mental emancipation and  political resurgence renascent africa emerged in the latter s and grew into adolescence in the s it was given birth by the african youths whom dr james e k aggrey had prophesied would do the job dr aggrey saw the end of slavery in africa and also witnessed the beginning of modern education in that continent he foresaw a youth movement coming into africa that some day may startle the world said he this restlessness all over africa stands for selfdiscovery selfrealization it tells of power just breaking through the five zikist postulates will be examined separately to determine how they have been applied in the past and how they can be applied now and in the future as africa journeys toward her greater glory spiritual balance africa became a breeding ground of many missionary activities after the end of the slave trade needless to say these missionaries were and are stillchristians in many cases the missionary activities created conflicts and confusion there was conflict among various christian churches there was confusion between the christians the indigenous religious sects and islam at the heart of this confused state was the need for understanding the need to respect the views of others and the need for a liveandletlive attitude toward others these needs were to be met if africans in the process of being christianized and practicing christianity were to develop a spiritual balance divorced from the extremes and dichotomies of rightness and wrongness and therefore have the capacity to blend ideas for the purposes of progress rather than for the possibilities of self and socialdestruction it was only through this balance that africa would make yet another great contribution to the human race a contribution that dr blyden beautifully noted in a speech in  when he said among other things africa may yet prove to be the spiritual conservatory of the world just as in past times egypt proved the stronghold of christianity after jerusalem fell and just as the noblest and greatest of the fathers of the christian church came out of egypt so it may be when the civilised nations in consequence of their wonderful material development shall have had their spiritual perceptions darkened and their spiritual susceptibilities blunted through the agency of a captivating and absorbing materialism it may be that they may have to resort to africa to recover some of the simple elements of faith for the promise of that land is that she shall stretch forth her hand unto god a very important element of the spiritual balance postulate is respect for the views of others in the field of religion in many parts of africa this respect has gained ground africans who were taught not to drink and eat in the houses of other religious groups have now learned to do the contrary and in many remote villages today it is not uncommon for catholics methodists anglicans and others to participate in harvests and bazaars and other common celebrations in the political field this respect developed but was later paralyzed by personality worship political jobbery and impatience politicians in their quest to become moneymakers and pose as the croesus of emerging africa became mean and intolerant in many african countries the leaders of opposition were recognized and paid out of the public treasury later some opposition members became prison targets and many of them crossed carpet either to avoid the myth and tag of the national enemies or on the pretext of adhering to one of the illdefined isms members of the opposition parties themselves were sometimes irresponsible and unpatriotic and therefore created doubt as to their abilities and sincerity to function as an alternate choice in the present state of affairs in africa the idea of spiritual balance should be made more practical by way of possible institutionalization it should be incorporated in civic courses and offered at all levels of education spiritual balance connotes sportsmanship statesmanship and the overall development of the individual and the society along a progressive continuum social regeneration social regeneration in the zikist context meant the detribalization of africa by africans africa has been naturally endowed with ethnic diversity which the slave trade exploited for a greater booty and which the berlin conference of  distorted while engaged in what president leopold senghor of senegal called balkanization of africa the exploitation and the distortion left scars which are largely responsible for nigerians seeing themselves not as nigerians but as hausas ibos and yorubas ghanaians seeing themselves as fantis and gas and kenyans seeing themselves as kikuyus luos and kambas social regeneration called for what is ethical just and equitable when africans deal with themselves and with others and a total divorce from provincialism or localism the deadly weapon of tribalism as cities grew and be came laboratories of crossethnic diffusion and as communication facilities became widespread and relatively inexpensive detribalization became a must the penny press multitribal political parties and other organizations started to eradicate tribalism which was and still isa social vermin but the process of social regeneration dwarfed when cheap politicians started to preach the contrary when political leadership tended to decay when corrupt civil servants began to practice nepotism and turned their departments into family estates the process lost its tempo as some of the socalled african elite justified their crimes on tribal basis and evoked tribalism when confronted with the realities of justice honesty and duty furthermore the process was marred by religious fanaticism and the nostalgia of an empire that was long buried by the egalitarian wave that continues to blow on man and his conscience today social regeneration is another must for africa african educators must realize that it is one of the mature ingredients for peace progress and stability in africa the education of africans must therefore take it into consideration economic determination africa is the home of small farmers and petty traders these groups are well known for their rugged individualism and suspicion economic activities based on these characteristics are bound to stagnate and breed poverty and squalor the ethos of peasant farming and petty trading lacks effective bargaining position and is liable to fall as easy prey to foreign monopolistic economic activities economic determination in the zikist sense called for a wellgrounded and sound economic foundation for the development of african land labor and capital dr nnamdi azikiwe the leading exponent of zikism chided the africans for their psychological aversion to company formation and noted that the main reason for the difference between african and european business administration is the principle of cooperation the two words linked together mean working together azikiwe said further the european by pooling his financial resources together obtains a great capital with which to transact his business    with this capital he gives employment to thousands he organizes branches of his business    he makes important contacts  he has good banking references and his business prospects are indicative of success if not in the immediate then in the remote future the african on the other hand prefers to work alone    spending the greater part of his life in accumulating capital the african proceeds to control his business singlehandedly for a onemans business it works out temporarily but time will come when that one man will face problems which will require many heads to solve     economic determination became a public policy goal in many african countries and had two main characteristics first the public sectors of these countries as members of the third world become the economic man and through the process of economic planning cooperation and coordination were required of all government departments second economic determination became the political catapult for launching the africanization process in the civil service in the private sector of the economy registered limited companies started to appear and with government aid and encouragement these companies achieved some degree of success some  african businessmen got on the road to business modernization and were supported by indigenous banks which embarked on the policy of credit liberalization foreign private enterprises were persuaded to africanize their personnel or pack and go their  commercial activities were limited to a certain segment of the marketing ladder and in some cases they were forced to accept african partnership training of indigenous personnel became a condition for new foreign enterprises planning to establish themselves in many parts of africa despite the above moves more has to be done to make economic determination a reality the cutthroat competition of many african petty traders and the proliferation that characterize some business activities a good example is rice milling in abakiliki eastern nigeria create excess capacities the call for economic cooperation has to be revived and people made to appreciate the wisdom of pooling resources to attain economic goals in the public sector the postindependence symbolic development must be halted and resources diverted to economic activities that are dynamic and capable of producing what gunnar myrdal called certain centrifugal spread effects of expansionary momentum from centers of economic expansion to other regions mental emancipation it is very common for some africans and some of the socalled africanists to overstate or exaggerate the african past for the simple sake of metooism it is even more common for the africaphobes to deny that africans ever had any history in fact as late as the s a british historian held that african history was nonexistent until the advent of the european overlords he wrote in part until the very recent penetration by europe the greater part of the african continent was without the wheel the plough and the transport animal almost without stone houses or clothes except for skins without writing and so without history this nonexistent thesis pervaded through the latter part of the th century but we do know that history is primarily made by people and has meaning because of its human content if africa ever had people they must have a history the existence of african history was further proved by the writings of such american scholars as w e b du bois and w l hansberry slavery the early missionary activities and later foreign domination at the doorstep made many africans think and feel that they were subhuman the painting black of the christian satan and the branding of things native as things diabolic led africans to develop fables admitting their own inferiority in the cameroons for example there is an old fable that tells how god created three sons a white man a black man and a gorilla while walking in the woods with his sons the gorilla and the black man got lost and god went on walking with the white man the zikists launched mental emancipation to educate the africans to have faith and confidence in themselves and all things african africans were told that biologically and otherwise they were equal to any other race in the world this revolution in thinking found expression in the writings of many african poets and people of african descent in the new world the latter spearheaded the search for racial identity and came up with the concept of the african personality while these writings became widely read in many african countries countries like nigeria came up with what the late mbonu ojike called bycott all bycottables the bycott doctrine stood for the glorification of african ways of life that were not inimical to african development it is in the arena of mental emancipation that zikism received its greatest response much to the dismay of the racists the average african now knows that he is a homme de bien this african realization must be exploited by african leadership in the building up of the continent political resurgence up to the midhalf of the twentieth century the african continent continued to be a political appendage of europe and was an important element of the european power struggle although the continent was a political football of european powers europeans held the view that africans were incapable of selfrule africans who had been educated in europe came back home as the noted beentos more english than the englishman and more  french than the frenchman since they were assimilated as civilized natives they became strangers in their native land and parvenus of the learned clubs such acquired status enable those afroeuropeans to become assimilados in portugal notables evolues citoyens francais in france and hilldwellers of the british colonial administration having lost touch with their kind the afroeuropeans were politically paralyzed and incapable of questioning or fighting the status quo to this group of africans foreign domination was a datum and since they had been blessed to eat from the masters table the master had to be thanked and adored rather than attacked molested or alienated in short the group became totally blind to the lethargic pace of social economic and political development in africa and assumed a supine position and developed protruding stomachs the idea of political resurgence produced a dual attack on the po  litical status quo first it called the africans attention to the fact that european hegemony was a recent phenomenon and not an act of god it demonstrated through various historical records that africans had enjoyed political independence in the past the existence of ethiopia atrophied the african servitude theory and the continued status of colonies as applied to africa was undemocratic unchristian and immoral second the zikists declared war on the african uncle toms then labelled old africa and called on the youths or new africa to wake up rise and shine at the early stage the political resurgence idea amounted to athanasius contra mundum  to the colonial masters it was a minority agitation to the afroeuropeans it was reckless uncalled for and disruptive however the idea gained ground and the aftermath of world war ii coupled with the call for political freedom for all men everywhere added some form of exogenous factors to it there are now  independent countries in africa each struggling with nationbuilding a journey which many countries all over the world are making or have made at one point in their history revive zikism the hysteria of political independence led to the drowning of zikism as a philosophy for political emancipation and nationbuilding the evolution of mushroom countries led to the establishment of local potentates surrounded by personality cults despite the fact that africa has become in the words of professor david finley a continent of conferences con tinental government one of the great dreams of zikism is as difficult today as continental government was in europe at the time of charlemagne in the face of african leaders perpetuating the colonial mentality african balkanization con m tinues as postindependence leadership in the african continent became internally corrupt and externally predatory a new wave of military regimes emerged young africans for whom colonial regimes are dim childhood memories are now finding themselves in a state of mental confusion because of the leadership vacuum that now prevails in many countries the situation is akin to what existed before the evolution of zikism thus the revival of the zikist philosophy is necessary and will provide african youths with a base for a further leap in the nationbuilding process revived zikism must be internalized by way of total domestication it should orient the youths to the noble task before them by teaching them the virtues of patriotism and the spirit of brotherhood duty and service since the original philosophy was dynamic and progressive its revived version should also maintain those attributes and should go all out to court and embrace not only the intellectuals and pseudointellectuals who parade the streets of lagos and nairobi but the total african society since zikism of the past had only access to the penny press the revived version should utilize all available communication media and should be incorporated as a complete course in civics for all african students in short efforts should be made to exploit the ideological content of zikism as a mobilizing factor in securing for africa and the africans a maximum developmental effort with a minimum of friction
the two best known j r black artists in amerj j icacharles white and jacob lawrence charles white is by far the more popular it might even be said that charles white is to painting and drawing what langston hughes is to literature both men direct their art to primal human concerns to the simple problems and pleasures the ordinary joys and sorrows of the long journey from the cradle to the grave in his successful career as fulltime painter white like hughes has found favor and support among the black people who are his subjects more affluent collectors like harry belafonte and eartha kitt own one or more original works by white but thousands of ordinary people all over the country have for many years coveted the modestly priced reproductions which have been made available in art shops and book stores this spring for the first time a book devoted to charles white and his work has been published called images of dignity the drawings of charles white ward ritchie press  the  x  a  page volume contains  photo reproductions of the artists drawings from an ink landscape executed in  when the artist was seven to a charcoal representing black womanhood created especially as an ebony magazine cover in  other features of the book are a foreword by harry belafonte who owns several white originals an appreciation by james a porter head of the department of fine arts and director of the art gallery at howard university and a long intimate perceptive commentary by benjamin horowitz owner of the heritage gallery in los angeles and the originator of the idea of the book of whites work the singer belafonte says there is a powerful sometimes violent beauty in his artistic interpretation of negro americana there is the poetic beauty of negro idiom this is the artists most profound contribution and it is significant that his art has never strayed far afield from the roots which gave birth to the » artist himself in a period when many artists have deserted reality for the various schools of nonobjectivity and abstractionism mr white has continued to work for broader horizons of human expression and to explore deeper dimensions of truth and reality mr porter who is a distinguished artist in his own right says charles white is one of the great voices among those black americans who during the past  i years have been the real interpreters of the american negro in this connection his oneman exhibitions have always been for me unforgettable events providing the highest opportunity for enlightenment through the revelation of powerful truths couched in a beautifully nuanced graphic poetry that unfailingly hits the mark indeed his art belongs not to one people but to all the world it is demonstrable that he has forged for himself an artistic language which transcends the boundaries set to art by a trivial subject matter or the shortlived vogue of social or political propaganda and mr horowitz says this in an era when the artist is expressing his detachment from the human condition by a cool and geometric style charles whites superb drawings challenge this lack of faith and selfinvolvement their epic quality affirms his deep concern for humanity his love of man and life and his belief that brotherhood is not just a catchword here on his canvasses the vitality and poignancy of humankind are captured for the eye to see and the heart to feel the artist who is part creek indian was born in chicago in  he attended the burke elementary school where his interest in art was first aroused and later the chicago art institute school in the interim he also won two scholarships to local art schools but was rebuffed when he appeared to claim the scholarships he grew up during the depression and because of his talent was able to oin the   famed works progress administration wpa art project where he remained for three years in  along with a group of chicago artists he exhibited his work at howard university the other artists included archibald motley eldzier cortor bernard goss and charles sebree as a member of the arts and crafts guild he helped to organize the south side community art center during the late thirties and early forties whites work was exhibited in a number of cities and galleries and his reputation grew  he also met and became friend or associate of a number of talented black people who were to make an impact on the cultural life of the nation among these were gordon parks katherine dunham gwendolyn brooks e simms campbell richard wright margaret walker theodore ward and willard motley in  and  white received rosenward foundation awards and in  he finished the  x  feet mural at hampton institute which is one of his landmark works other white murals are in the chicago public library and at tuskegee institute a visit to mexico introduced white to that countrys artists the great david siqueiros among them and to the art of lithography he returned from mexico and lived for awhile in new york city where he met and was influenced by such artists as robert gwathmey and philip evergood and men like w e b du bois langston hughes and paul robeson he traveled in europe and returned to find that his reputation had grown even more in america the metropolitan museum of art exhibited his work in  and his works were purchased by the whitney museum howard university and atlanta university for

frantz fanon s peau noire masques blancs black skin white masks first published in  in french was made accessible to the englishspeaking public for the first time with the translated version brought out by grove press last spring this book will be of special interest to those already familiar with fanons the wretched of the earth grove press the collected body of fanons work all published originally in french is slowly becoming available in english though not in chronological order a brief resume may be helpful here peau noire masques blancs black skin white masks appeared in  paris followed in  by sociologie dune revolution lan v de la revolution algerienne published in translation as studies of a dying colonialism by monthly review press in  the nowfamous les damne de la terre wretched of the earth made its original appearance in paris interestingly enough in  there appeared posthumously in paris a collection of political and revolutionary writings scanning the period   but with a preponderance of the articles written in the period  pour la revolution africaine to be available in english in the fall of  as toward the african revolution monthly review press if you have read his last and probably his most polished wretched of the earth you will now be able to look at his first serious fulllength statement of the whiteblack problem if this is to be your first experience of fanon you are fortunate to be able to take him up in chronological order for black skin white masks has a profoundly sincerely personal point of departure fanon published the book a young man of  just after having completed his psychiatric training in an attempt to come to terms with the problem of racism and the deculturization and loss of identity engendered by it thus at the beginning of his career he had already blocked out what was to be his own special field of endeavor for the remaining ten years or so of his life    in all serenity i think that it would be a good thing if certain things were said   we read these words on the first page they are like the final line of the first stanza of a poem a minute or so further along we read this book should have been written three years ago  but then truths were setting us aflame    the underlying personal source is avowed from the beginning and a lyricism springs forth from these first pages which on occasion soars to the level of the poetic quest of man after his own nature his basic theme as the prefacer francis jeanson states is his own blackness his experience as a black man plunged into a white world the preface is from the original  edition a postface was included in  also by francis jeanson the purpose in the first case must certainly have been to break the shock for a largely white audience for fanons frankness is at times brutaland jeanson seems to feel obliged to justify the theme fully the postface portrays rather romantically fanons writings in terms of his beliefs with some reference to his lived experience the book proper is organized around an introduction in which fanon speaks in general terms of what he calls double narcissism the white who feels himself superior and the black who is bent on showing the white that he is his intellectual equal a vicious circle is then set up there appears to be no exit fanon suggests that only a psychoanalytical interpretation of the black problem can reveal the affective anomalies which are responsible for the complexual edifice he examines aspects of this complexual edifice in chapters dealing with the black mans attitude toward language the attitude of the woman of color toward the white man that of the man of color toward the white woman he gives his attention to the dependency complex of the colonized man then in an existential frame of mind and in a style reminiscent of the streamofconsciousness novel he turns to the thought processes and the emotional reactions of the black man being looked upon by a white world he is an object a stereotype fanon clearly prefigures his later writings in a chapter dealing with the negro and psychopathology then proceeds to examine whiteblack confrontation from adlerian and hegelian points of departure his last chapter is significantly en i titled by way of conclusion throughout the reader recognizes the environment in which fanons impressions and perceptions developed and matured the colonial west indies unproud humble in its underdeveloped status as a farremoved appendage of the glittering mothercapital the situation of the colonial student once in france coming face to face with white attitudesand white women the great majority of the examples and specific incidents are drawn from these two situations but the book is more than this fanon is writing after the emotional turmoil has subsided after the formalization of insight brought about by psychiatric training and unfolding before us we see a first attempt at a coherent statement of problem and causes a thought which starts other thoughts in motion a statement which is sometimes incomplete and sometimes hard to follow because the indirect statement of poetry and  lyricism occasionally gives way to clinical style and an assumption that the reader is acquainted with technical and specialized literature but the statement remains dynamic inspiring ecause dancing behind it and luring us on we know there is an answer sensed but not yet attained peau noire masques blancs is a positive act and through its mere expression begins our bodily and mental liberation and weas did fanonfind ourselves free to question the quest and its lyric expression are sustained to the endthe morning star of elhajj malik shabazz arose in omaha nebraska forty years thereafter it descended in the dark chamber of a dark harlem ballroom malcolms fury on earth transformed the hopeless echoes of black nationalists into a sunset bust of flames in the way the story is told there existed in his cry the lost pride of africa malcolms walk through this century brought forth the image of high black kings and queens who knew the nile by sound and the sudan by sight poet lawrence p neal this curious but notable anthology of poetry for malcolm poems on the life and death of malcolm_x broadside  edited by dudley randall and margaret burroughs beams a radiance few critics can dispute malcolms holocaust was a dramatization of our societys absurdity in dealing with people of african heritage malcolm died in the tradition of rare prophets these poems cover with clarity and honesty his career as a hustler prisoner muslim statesman and finally a moving spirit malcolm belongs to all ages he belongs to that feral voodooism which allows some men to seep through our fetid materialism he magnified through his words and deeds a royal alternative for doomed blacks he made marching middleclass blacks reexamine a white god and a black life he made a black god impossible and a white the editors have selected poems which treat malcolm as the prince of black manhood wordsworth said that poetry should speak of the man the malcolm one finds in this anthology is the christ one finds in the bible he is ghettorisen a philosophicaltragedy a soul brother a political seer a black christ weeping a denmark vesey urbanized a human thunderstorm more wretched than faceless waifs a song seeking melody why was he angry what made him an outlaw ossie davis brilliantly responds to those questions in his candid preface the poems in this anthology sprang forth from malcolms caravanserai they express malcolms brief life the mystery of his existence and the wry discontent of his distant drum beating out his seeds of wisdom and great argument and not even an hour has passed since malcolms death yet for an answer to his death we have no reply margaret danner in meditative response to malcolms spirit few black revolutionaries will venture into mississippis delta screaming for justice or upsetting the old order by virtue of its defiance and guns the spirit of malcolm whatever his life might have been honors and respects the ghosts goblins evil spirits fire clouds blackness that life is seemingly echoing from the ghetto to death we are caught in the opium of malcolms weeds his death diminished black manhood it is crowned by his upwardness near those final days of life the poets in this anthology sense the phantasy the hideous dreams in council with the man several poets seem to remember only one thing about malcolm his manhood for that which these poets loved most in malcolm seems clearer in his absence malcolms strange mixture of lights his exquisite negroness stripped of americana his islamic intuition and mass charisma comes through in the lyricism of this poetic requiem the interpenetration of negritude expresses itself in malcolms dialogue on earth the negro middleclass may miss the point since many of the conceptual images allude to the movement critics who dwell on the mellowness and softness of cullen and dunbar may not feel the ancient regime of stereotype subside to newer perceptions and feelings among todays black poets white poets like louis simpson will feel dismayed and left out not unless they now dance in the ballroom of malcolms truth simpson once believed the negro was incapable of creating good poetry there are poems in this volume simpsons talent could never bring forth dudley randall and margaret burroughs distinguish themselves by presenting new sophisticated voices angry voices anarchic bards but any real work of art must deal with the individual complexities of philosophy and life this book is a literary ghetto virgin one of many books that black people must publish themselves it is the most encouraging sign of black consciousness that ive witnessed lately the illumination of malcolms soul is so powerful that we must mark the pages for humanity for whoever touches this booktouches malcolm this is a book of truth as well as poetry this is malcolms aesthetic primer this is a black book malcolms soul is at rest bound by love and depression within these pages etheridge knight
a first novel the last day of lin by gordon m williams is better coin charles stein  day  than could be deduced from the jacket blurb the author may have had his sights fixed on movie rights and the novel does have a cinematic documentary technique but it is still a better piece of work than the publishers imply in their lid off an english seaside town copy an american negro soldier chicagoborn and lonely gets drunk in a pub one night and vaguely remembers a woman the next morning a girl complains that she has been raped by a colored man and lincoln charless last day begins a brutal sergeant lovingly contemplates the time when charles will be at his mercy in the stockade the yearold boy starts forlornly to make a list of people who might help him but a contemptuous word from a cook corporal touches him on the raw he throws scalding coffee at his tormentor and crosses the line into violence as he ran between the wooden barrack huts of g squadron private lincoln charles shouted at bull krasko and all the other men who were his enemies shouted at them silently in his mind he knew exactly what he was going to do he was going to stop them once and for all from this point on private charles is lost and it is part of the authors achievement that as the long day wears on the tension never slackens seaton with its corrupt mayor its weak chief constable of police its ambitious frustrated newspaper men and the various dubieties surrounding the bathing beauty contest gives at the pressure points as charles with his carbine repeater ready proceeds on his hopeless quest for justice and revenge for a time like a drunk crossing a busy street he bears a charmed life but inevitably he dies on a deserted beach goaded beyond reason by the circumstances of his life and the stupidity ineptitude and cruelty of his fellow men it is an unsentimental novel and its subject is not a hero even though the end is violent lincoln charles is not the victim of a lynch mob he is destroyed by an indifferent selfprotecting society composed of the british facesavers and the american military machine gordon williams moves easily in the idioms of both countries and has cast his drama perceptively with characters who are credible and typical without being cliches that they are none of them likeable is scarcely surprising
too often famous or infamous events of history are reduced to clashes between institutions and symbols even when the chief adversaries take on the guise of men they become institutions in the eyes of those who later attempt to explain what happened napoleon for example was a man and we partially know him as such it is also true that we know him as a typea symbol he is also to a very great extent an institution tana de gamezs the yoke and the star bobbsmerrill  is a book that attempts to give us an understanding of the people involved in the cuban revolution of  as personalities historical novels which is the genre of the yoke and the star have license to tell about a historical event without religiously adhering to the facts this same license allows the writer to give color and life to men and women involved who might otherwise lack these attributes missda gamez is not successful in either of the roles a successful historical novelist can play the book does not make the characters live as people but represents them as symbols and institutions also we are not provided with enough color or life in the characters to overcome the first deficiency the book is certainly not without points to recommend it we are provided with a glimpse of the kind of people who are necessary to execute the kind of event unfortunately this is too little to save the book itself
the emphasis upon negritude in african writing in french inspired its countervailing force in its rejection by nigerian practitioners of their own sullen craft they with their ghanaian counterparts have for the most part resisted what they deemed a cultural imperialism an imposition from an alien source namely africans speaking french their reaction was epitomized by wole soyinka in his oftquoted remark to the effect that since the tiger does not stalk about crying his tigritude why then is it necessary for the negro to proclaim his negritude senghors reply in his howard university speech in september was scarcely calculated to inspire the reconciliation for which he is celebrated in so many words he laments that the brute saxons have evidently beaten an inferiority complex into their colonials cerebella let us only remark that whatever course the debate will take both writers possess imposing talents and will doubtlessly acquit themselves well soyinkas feeling however is shared by many others it has been expressed in a different sense by alioune diop one of the architects of the reconstruction of the african cultural edifice it is a sad thing diop has said to find it necessary to extol ones race at this historical juncture however in the century of the color problem it is a necessary task the world is emerging from its hierarchical vision of mankind and such evangelism is an inevitable stage through which the evolutionary process must pass soyinka however cannot accept what he seems to consider to be merely a forensic necessity his explanation reminds us of the first roosevelts injunction to speak softly but carry a big stick it seems after all it is this which is more akin to soyinkas intent than to reject as many think he has done the effort to recapture the african identity according to report soyinka in berlin in  clarified his attitude it is true he said the tiger is silent on the subject but this does not mean he does not demonstrate a tigritude he lies in wait to pounce upon his prey and to perform a very specific tigritude similarly the implication is obvious negritude also though not proclaimed may be nonetheless a reality a consideration of soyinkas writing posed against the evangel of leopold senghor foremost articulator of negritude will not enable us to pin the former neatly on a map but perhaps to learn something of the terrain on which he stalks about comparison is made difficult by the fact that the two write in different media soyinka is essentially a playwright while senghor is a poet it is axiomatic that poetry lends itself more freely to the demands of the creative imagination senghor in writing a poem is not subjected to the same necessity of plot motivation of character etc although the difference impedes the contrast it does not totally obscure it our concern is with the presence in their work of an african inspiration which may be expressed although differently in either form the pervading tone of senghors work is one of faith an affirmation of faith in his continent his people and more broadly in mankind and in life itself his is a whitmanesque embrace of the other a pantheism finding the life spirit in all things as well as in being in every aspect of nature this pantheistic emphasis however is not indiscriminate the clearly evident and overwhelming love in senghors work is for his homeland and his people it is at once a personal and a very public poetry he retreats within himself to externalize in his essentially declamatory manner the traditional values of africa of old his is a work of nostalgia the nostalgia of exile of redemption of a fallen people affirming and celebrating their past greatness in the return of the prodigal son he returns to the land of his ancestors after the years of wandering in europe elephant of mbissel hear my reverent prayer give me the fervent learning of the great doctors of timbuktu give me the determination of soni ali son of

if need be in the smell of powder and guns keep root in my freed heart the first love of the same people make me your master of language or rather let me be named the ambassador of my people ix bless you my fathers who bless the prodigal son let me see once more on the right where the women stay the place where i played with the doves and my brothers the sons of the lion ah to sleep once more in the fresh bed of my childhood ah once more those black dear hands to tuck in my sleep once more the white smile of my mother tomorrow i shall take again the road to europe road of my embassy homesick for my black land it is quickly evident that almost a generation separates the two writers an observer remarked in  that as he examined the content of presence africaine he was far more interested in the cultural aspects of the african experience than in the voluminous embroilment in the unfolding political scene the editor replied however that the cultural life could not  flourish until the political conditions to nourish it were achieved this preindependence struggle between africa and europe was a major influence in shaping the creative consciousness of senghor running as a dominant motif throughout his work is the counterpoint of color the conflict between africa and the west senghor is forerunner he announces the goal he proclaims a new vision he rejects the old western domination focusing upon the tensions inher  ent in the struggle toward freedom in his choosing between isabella and soukeina for koras and balafong iii in his prayer to the masks in his poetic encounter with new york we see how his work is pervaded with an awareness of the conflict as professor in the lycee in tours and in paris he muses as he watches his fair students  you my lambs my delight with eyes that shall not look upon my age i was not always a shepherd of fair heads on the arid plains of your books not always the good official deferring to his superiors « the good colleague polite elegant with glovessmiling but rarely laughing old france old university all the old routine my lambs my childhood is as old as the world and i am as young as the everlasting youth of the worlds dawn  the poetesses of the sanctuary have given me suck the kings griots have sung me the authentic legend of my race to the  sounds of the high koras soyinka to the contrary evinces no concern over the clash between europe and africa the reader searches in vain for the evidence that soyinka is even slightly aware of what looms for senghor as an overweening cosmic rupture into i am black and you are white with perhaps one exceptionhis well known encounter with the london landlady one can simply wonder whether this absence of racial motif stems from conscious decision or from the natural direction of soyinkas creative impulse obviously his early creative years were not shaped as were senghors by the political issues that dominated preindependence africa the political struggle against britain had been conducted largely by the generation which preceded him his relatively brief student years at the university at leeds contrast sharply with two decades of senghors exile amid the sly silences of the european night soyinka appears centrally oriented toward an essentially african experience a sophisticated intelligence at home in either culture but obsessed with no pervasive sense of conflict between the two for soyinka negritude would be as the term negro in elijah mohammads theocracy an invention of the devil a name inspired by the raceconscious west in none of his plays nor evidently in most of his poetry is soyinka concerned with the conflict of europe and africa in a searching essay however entitled and after the narcissist appearing in the african forum spring  soyinka makes the accusation that senghor declaims upon the african reality but fails to produce it senghors poetry he asserts falls short of achieving the wonders it celebrates remaining static and sterile in a narcissistic contemplation of the poet himself he accuses senghor of deception in that while purporting to celebrate the black poet and to glorify the african heritage he is in actuality indulging in an increasingly monotonous selfadulation he fails to achieve the animist awareness to transform the minutiae of experience into the word of a new psychic sensibility which according to soyinka is at the heart of the african poetic heritage the charge touches upon a basic aspect of the creative impulse and should help to illumine the differences between the two the essay is immediately noteworthy in the clarification it affords regarding what some have taken to be as we have indicated a rejection by soyinka of negritude and of the existence of a unique african sensibility the reaction to this cultural imperialism can be understood in large measure by the resentment more hinted at than made plain against a movement purportedly imposing canons of literary and psychic law to which the hopefuls of ibadan and accra would have to adhere the creative instinct being by definition largely a reaction against fiat the result should not have been difficult to foresee it is ironic that this cast in iron aspect of negritude a force conceived to remove the western cultural yoke was probably due in large measure to wellintentioned europeans who were among the earliest enthusiasts of an african renaissance their missionary zeal to carry the word beyond dakar appears to have inspired a counter force which seemed at first sheer apostasy but which now begins to reveal itself more probably as a nailing of an edict to the door at the mbari club the divinity at least in african concern is the same the road to redemption is different as to soyinkas charge of narcissism a preoccupation with the self is occupational with the poet and as soyinka himself agreed what otherwise might probably be termed narcissism is a frequent and likely form of affirmation in a literature of exploration and of rediscovery walt whitman could reasonably be considered vainglorious as he celebrates in himself a new universe of concern langston hughes insists that he too is beautiful and that he will too sit down at the welcome table as he pushes back limiting american horizons the poetry of irelands cultural rebirth contained what could be termed its own imaginative narcissism selfglorification can serve a purpose someone remarked that thousands of persons since nobody knows my name will never again look down at the dark face of a negro boy without for a second wondering whether the keen intelligence of a james baldwin is returning that gaze it is true that senghor is much concerned with senghor but in thrusting himself upon the world he has to a degree changed that world soyinka quotes the following passages from senghor characterizing them as deceptive claiming that under the guise of glorifying man and poet and of exploring the nature of poetry he is in reality paying increasingly ecstatic tribute to himself in a sequence of static communal concretions am not the rhythm it holds me still it carves all my body like a statue of baule it must be admitted however despite soyinka that both passages display a compelling lyric beauty and serve an esthetic purpose evident within the context of the poems in their entirety it is also apparent on the face of them that they aid in the labor of rediscovery they speak to the lines of david diop hey boy a chair a napkin a drink le temps du martyr it is curiousfrom the victim of the colonial experience would normally be expected a reaction of bitterness and resentment here the contrary seems to be the case it is soyinka who is lacerating in his mood not we have seen against the european but adventitiously in regard to any or all who might fall under his critical gazewithout regard to race creed or continental origin this corrosive strain does not mean soyinka is without humor some of the scenes in the trials of brother jethro and the lion and the jewel are hilarious even in the serious dance of the forests we have the old mans interesting and homely advice    if the guest wont go quietly we must shout out the price of food but there is in these plays as in his others a caustic overview a ready corrosive wit swift to obey the playwrights ranging inclination to thrust and cut to the quick it is an effective talent adding sharpness and excitement even if it may impede in another dimension senghor of course is not witless his poetry simply lacks wit this is not to gainsay an extraordinary intellectual capacity and a rare ingenuity of argument evident in both his poetry and his prose wit borders on the cruel and excels in giving pain senghor evinces no such inclination this absence moreover is of a piece with the public and solemn character of his creative work addressed as it is not to the interior experience of the individual but in its essentially declamatory manner to europe and to mon peuple noir as anyone concerned with the public mood is aware intellectual agility is not the tool to touch the wellsprings of the collective will whether by conscious design or by virtue of the nature of his talent senghors work observes this restriction this particular contrast in the work of the two writers bears a relation to what is probably the most crucial area of comparison between the two as we have seen soyinka accuses senghor of making resounding and narcissistic public utterances celebrating and calling for what he senghor is unable to achieve to make manifest the true african sensibility the charge makes crucial obviously the nature of the poetic heritage of which soyinka speaks he appears to find it at root in the animist concept of the universe there is no rigid distinction between matter and spirit matter is infused with spirit and existence is a continuum of spirit inherent in an endless variety of material forms the african poetic labor is to transcend the superficial division and by and through the word to breach the threshold of that merger of spirit and matter wherein diversity becomes one there are similarities here of course with other cultures and the concept is reminiscent in the esthetic world of the more ambitious hopes of the fauves among the painters and earlier in the latter half of the nineteenth century the symbolist poets in france it is true however that while europe upon occasion has arrived at this point in its esthetic hadj it appears to have been inherent in the african vision since its remote and obscure origins it does appear to be accurate to say that senghors avowed and declamatory return to african traditions is in a sense a staking of a claim stopping short of its more profound exploitation he acclaims the rediscovery of the african genius he renounces the cramping tutelage of europe he invokes the tribal totems and in eloquent praise poems celebrates the old gods and the old customs however having conjured upand brilliantlythe african presence he does not complete the task it is left to others to work the mine field which he has opened and proclaimed senghors work which has been a pioneer labor is to wrest recognition of a valid african experience from the hostile soil of western imperialism this concern is foremost throughout his first three volumes chants dombre  h os ties noires  and chants pour naett  it is present still in ethiopiques  as more confidently he speaks as the representative of his reclaimed people at the same time however his tone is becoming ambivalent and like armattoe of the gold coast for the first time he perceives and laments defects in his hitherto idealized homeland and confesses his need for the brilliance and beauty of europe i have need of the maytime murmuring at montsouris of the splendour of the tuileries at the end of summer epitre a la princesse v in the same poem he finds he must lament in his letter to his princess of belborg that the land of my mother is not a noble land yes i know it is not a noble land for it belongs to the third day half water half earth my nobleness princess is to live that land according to that land one is reminded in a reverse parallel of how gauguin in a last painting as death approached in tropical tahiti created an utterly nostalgic portrayal of the snowcovered town in the france of his youth senghors poetic need has gone full cycle from the shifting vision sartre described in orphee noir in  in which the pole pull of african desire had moved from kamchatka and the capitols of europe to the sundrenched cities of africa and again in nocturnes  senghor has gone a step beyond not however toward an exploration of the african tradition he has acclaimed but into a personal meditative examination of the nature of poetry and other questions upon which he is reflecting soyinkas work provides a fruitful contrast nowhere does he engage in a similar nostalgic and idealized invocation of historic africa there is no tribute to africas past glory things african appear to find no more worthy an assessment in his caustic lexicon than europe or any other spot on the benighted globe the characters of his plays curse evenly both europe and africa past as well as present in both the road and a dance of the forests for example we are made aware of the horror of motor travel obaneji in the latter remarks another passenger lorry they call it the incinerator  of the seventy people in it five escaped it overturned you see and the body was built of wood we learn the extended family institution is a decided nuisance rola this whole family business sickens me  a pack of dirty yelling grandmas and fleabitten children  in the swamp dwellers we see that agrarian life is burdensome and primitive riddled with fraud but flight to the city lagos results only in personal disintegration in the lion and the jewel soyinka derides both the old and the new while in the strong breed though working seriously to explore tribal traditions he implicitly makes the severest criticism of its inadequacies particularly in a dance of the forests do we learn that africas vaunted past is tyranny adenebi the accumulated heritage that is what we are celebrating mali chaka songhai glory empires but you cannot feel it can you and the scorned queen of medieval africa madame tortoise who has a special punishment for her disobedient warrior guards pay close attention to my words do eunuchs not fetch a good price at the market guard madame woman the victims wife have pity have pity madame tortoise to the warrior you are lost but have your wish warriors are sold as men but eunuchs guard the harems of other mata kharibus drooling on wares they cannot taste choose and the bereaved wife eight centuries later my knowledge is the hate alone the little ball of hate alone consumed me    was it for this for this children plagued their mothers and the historian we were so near to the greatness of troy and greece   mean this is war as it should be fought    over nothing  do you not agree these plays force our awareness that as suggested soyinka is doing what senghor is not he is working with the materials and in the context of the traditional africanframework to explore the fundamental questions of his society and more deeply of existence not that he produces decipherable answers he can be said indeed to have achieved obscurity the dimly perceived cast of characters wandering murkily about in a dance of the forests clearly leaves us certainly at first with a sense of a dimly perceived cast of characters wandering murkily etc we must confess of course that we are as probably the majority of soyinkas readers ignorant of the yoruba lore crucial to fuller comprehension and also not having had an opportunity to see the plays two excepted that we have merely read them yet more significantly it is evident that the playwright particularly i n a dance strong breed and the road is seeking to come to grips with the inner reaches of reality not in terms of western values but in utilizing the resources of a unique african culture that he may not completely succeed does not diminish the merit of the effort we are reminded of faulkners appraisal of thomas wolfe as the first among american novelists not because of his accomplished work which was uneven but because of the scope of his undertaking although in the article in question soyinka addresses himself largely to mr senghor in the process he reveals his esthetic concern and states his concept of the task of the african artist he cites his countryman the poet okigbo who he feels is able to achieve the moment of imagic separation in which the poet is relieved of his personal identity and merges in awareness with his vision the african animist knowledge of the oneness of the objects of ritual and ritualism of matter and psyche is in okigbo he states achieved it becomes clear that this is soyinkas search as his play unfolds as well as his preoccupation in some of his poetry in a dance soyinka works with the materials of the animist tradition aroni the lame one is in communication with the ancestors who are invited to send representatives to the gathering of the tribes from eight centuries of death the reanimated couple emerge not the illustrious forebears hoped for but accusers as we have seen who remind the living of the shame of an ignoble past it is evident that while soyinka condemns aspects of that past along with that modern triumph the automobile he continues to work within the framework of the tradition ogun the yoruba god with both destructive and creative proclivities evokes the master carvers who pass their spirit into the wood the dead characters speak of their previous lives in the animist concept of cyclic life renewal it is in the words of ritual in a dance of the forests that the dancer uncoils the chain that leads into the dead as the dirgeman calls for space for the dead to danceand after the eightcentury flash back we hear the words of the rites of the dead the halfchild the dead woman the spirit voices of things and finally those of the colony of ants soyinka may be ambivalent about the tradition but still he is working within the area of its assumptions probably nowhere more so than in a dance of the forests in the swamp dwellers his protagonists search leads him evidently to reject both the tribal old with its superstitious frauds as well as the decadence of the urban new strong breed however reveals again the strong sense of the personal quest of the author severely critical of the inhumanity of the carrier or scapegoat tradition and yet presenting a hero who will not flee but elects to suffer under the system he condemns in the road published in  soyinka moves closer toward a modern concern both in the physical setting and in the philosophic quest of the professor whose dedication to the word has animist roots but who we are informed was a lay reader in the christian church here again we are aware of the centrality of ogun in soyinkas cosmology ogun that yoruba embodiment of good and of destructiveness appears properly incarnated in the professor the master forger who is suspect of even darker misdeeds and who at the same time is the earnest seeker after enlightenment a paradoxical character cynical derisive gloomy and faithful advocate of the word in his superb essay salutation to the gut soyinka repeats in another fashion his old theme describing how even at the table the pleasurepain dialectic is the path the gourmet must travel to culinary bliss it is evident throughout his work even in the hilarious trials of brother jethro in that rakish mockery of modernity the lion and the jewel and in that tour de force salutation to the gut soyinka is engaged in a quest with his artists tools he explores the obscure trails of the animist heritage explicitly concerned with the root questions of existence in contrast senghors appears a more secular verse while he celebrates the african tradition he does not in the sense of soyinka work within it yet a curious paradox suggests itself stemming in  part from the different vision of the two writers senghor in his expository prose has previously addressed himself to the subject which soyinka treats in his creative  works in senghors vision the heart of the african sensibility would not be found in the unfolding riddles of soyinkas dance or his strong breed but through the rhythmic invocation of the vital  force not through soyinkas knowledge not in the theme but in the style and in the manner  senghor has written what is rhythm it is the architecture of being the internal dyna  mism which gives it form the sys  tern of waves which it emits to the attention of others the pure ex f pression of the vital force rhythm it is the vibratory shock the force which through the senses seizes us at the root of being and in the negroafrican it is in the very « degree to which he envelops himself in sensuality that the rhythm illuminates the spirit senghor would thus find the african access to illumination through rhythmic utterance through an m open participative approach to other things and other beings as contrasted with what appears to be a strong cerebral inclination of soyinka whose style here seems closer to the detailed analytical proclivity of the west it is in the manner of his approach says senghor rather than in the substance of his concern that the african sensibility is manifest it is his intensely emotional and intuitive nature which is the hallmark of the african personality if senghors conceptual assumptions are correct he may be more relevantly endowed by a capricious nature than is soyinka to achieve or to inspire the african poetic vision while it is not in senghors work that sounds the great bass drum of cesaire nor mounts the crescendo of david diops rama kam yet through his poetry moves though more muted a compelling and complex rhythm which would place him within the presumed african esthetic consider for example congo femme noise in stanza ix of for koras and balafong toko waly my uncle nuit de sine prayer to the masks in these poems senghor does not in the manner soyinka cites in okigbo undertake nor succeed in cracking a mystic sound barrier but soyinka cannot fairly deny the evocatory power for example of the last lines of congo quent poem though in the tradition of his culture could be the invocation of an essentially western muse there is in senghor visavis the gods of his origins a crisis of belief the question is posed whether he calls upon the sacred powers of old for the profane purposes of a western esthetic this appears also to be soyinkas accusation and would seem to have more substance than if made for example against birago diop of the famous souffles ecoute plus souvent les choses que les etres etc on the other hand to continue with senghors concept of the african psyche it is difficult to perceive a sense of rhythmic impulse in soyinka either in his drama or in his poetry he appears largely to be almost assertively disjunctive indifferent to rhythmic order even arrogantly awkward his quotation from okigbo suggests also his approach to poetic illumination has little to do with senghors concept of rhythmic invocation the highest sense of style evident in soyinkas work is neither in his plays nor in his poetry but in his essays witness salutation to the gut and after the narcissist itself the argument could be made that the obscure and convoluted unfolding of soyinkas serious plays would in senghors distinction between the discursive analytic west and the intuitive emotional participative africa range soyinka more properly in the former category if the african is as senghor urges essentially participative seeking to install himself sympathetically in the other rather than to analyze to dissect to dominate we look with little success for evidence of soyinkas african identity there is in his works little of the generous warmly emotional quality which appears to infuse senghors poetry public and declamatory as much of it is and if there is adulation in senghor it is not exclusively of the self his praise poems are in tribute to others as well both to things and to persons in soyinkas essentially melancholy vision there is small tribute to anyonethere are few instances of genuine positive emotion of joyous fraternity of human solidarity there are perhaps one or two exceptions fatherson and sonwife in the strong breed motherson in the swamp dweller but these relationships too are doomed and gloomily overcast with tragedy more consonant with his sardonic mood are the derisive observations of the professor in the road and his own invitation to the landlady in london soyinkas lacerating wit is scarcely the model of senghors concept of the contrapuntal progression through mutual sympathy to communion and merger let us observe here that remote as we are from the subject culture of the dispute we see as through a glass and must form opinion on the artists work without benefit of confrontation with either ogun or the dyoung dyoungs of dyilor there is the further issue raised by soyinkas charge the function of art itself there is ambivalence in soyinka but his belief is clear that the african poets role is to transcend the diversity of the secular world through the intermediary of the word to know and to participate in the spirit reality immanent throughout existence in the west there is a distinction between the aesthetic and the mystic illumination it is not clear that soyinka makes this distinction senghor apparently does and for the most part his poetry does not seek to achieve what soyinka decries as its lack it does seek in the western manner a similar esthetic moment in which as bernard berenson attests substance and form merge and esthetic recognition strikes the beholder in africa however the spirits are invoked by the carver and pass into the wood senghor much as western artists employ for secular purposes the symbols of a no longer unquestioned christianity addresses himself to the masks of the ancestors with a consciousness of europe and the cultural struggle he wages for his homeland soyinkas quest keeps him on the gloomy trail of ogun as he probes the riddles of existence
of the blackest part of my soul across the zebra striping  r of my mind surges this desire to be suddenly white  i t i wish to be acknowledged not as black but as white s e nowand this is a form of recognition that hegel had not envisagedwho but a white woman can do this for me by loving me she proves that i am worthy of white love i am loved like a white man i am a white man her love takes me onto the noble road that leads to total realization    i marry white culture white beauty white whiteness when my restless hands caress those white breasts they grasp white civilization and dignity and make them mine some thirty years ago a coalblack negro in a paris bed with a maddening blonde shouted at the moment of orgasm hurrah for schoelcher when one recalls that it was victor schoelcher who persuaded the third republic to adopt the decree abolishing slavery one understands why it is necessary to elaborate somewhat on the possible aspects of relations between black men and white women it will be argued that this little tale is not authenticated but simply that it could be born and survive through the years is an indication it is no fallacy for the anecdote renews a conflict that active or dormant is always real its persistence attests to the black worlds endorsement to say it another way when a story flourishes in the heart of a folklore it is because in one way or another it expresses an aspect of the spirit of the group in analyzing je suis martiniquaise and nini we have seen how the negro woman behaves with the white man through a novel by rene maranwhich seems to be autobiographicallet us try to understand what happens when the man is black and the woman white the problem is admirably laid out for the character of jean veneuse will make it possible for us to go much more deeply into the attitude of the black man what are the terms of this problem jean veneuse is a negro born in the antilles he has lived in bordeaux for years so he is a european but he is black so he is a negro there is the conflict he does not understand his own race and the whites do not understand him and he observes the europeans in general and the french in particular not satisfied with simply ignoring the negro of the colonies repudiate the one whom they have shaped into their own image  the personality of the author does not emerge quite so easily as one might wish an orphan sent to a provincial boardingschool he is compelled to spend his vacations there his friends and acquaintances scatter all over france on the slightest pretext whereas the little negro is forced into the habit of solitude so that his best friends are his books at the extreme i should say there is a certain accusatory character a certain resentment an illdisciplined aggression in the long listtoo longof traveling companions that the author offers us at the extreme  say but it is exactly to the extreme that we have to go unable to be assimilated unable to pass unnoticed he consoles himself by associating with the dead or at least the absent and his associations unlike his life ignore the barriers of centuries and oceans he talks with marcus aurelius joinville pascal perez galdos rabindranath tagore if we were compelled to hang a label on jean veneuse we should have to call him an introvert others might call him a sentimentalist but a sentimentalist who is always careful to contrive a way of winning out on the level of ideas and knowledge as a matter of fact his friends and schoolmates hold him in high regard what a perpetual dreamer you know my old pal veneuse is really a character he never takes his nose out of his books except to scribble all over his notebooks but a sentimentalist who goes nonstop from singing spanish songs to translating into english shy but uneasy as well as i was leaving them i heard divrande say to him a good kid that veneusehe seems to like being sad and quiet but hes always helpful you can trust him youll see hes the kind of negro that a lot of white guys ought to be like uneasy and anxious indeed an anxious man who cannot escape his body we know from other sources that rene maran cherished an affection for andre gide it seems possible to find a resemblance between the ending of un homme pareil aux autres and that of gides strait is the gate this departure this tone of emotional pain of moral impossibility seems an echo of the story of jerome and alissa but there remains the fact that veneuse is black he is a bear who loves solitude he is a thinker and when a woman tries to start a flirtation with him he says are you trying to smoke out an old bear like me be careful my dear courage is a fine thing but youre going to get yourself talked about if you go on attracting attention this way a negro shamefulits beneath contempt associating with anybody of that race is just utterly disgracing yourself above all he wants to prove to the others that he is a man their equal but let us not be misled jean veneuse is the man who has to be convinced it is in the roots of his soul as complicated as that of any european that the doubt persists if the expression may be allowed jean veneuse is the lamb to be slaughtered let us make the effort after having quoted stendhal and mentioned the phenomenon of crystallization he declares that he love for the simplicity of the negro is a myth created by superficial observers i love clarisse i love mme coulanges and it is andree marielle whom i really love only she no one else who is andree marielle you know who she is the daughter of the poet louis marielle but now you see that this negro who has raised himself through his own intelligence and his assiduous labors to the level of the thought and the culture of europe is incapable of escaping his race andree marielle is white no solution seems possible yet association with payot gide moreas and voltaire seemed to have wiped out all that in all good faith jean veneuse believed in that culture and set himself to love this new world he had discovered and conquered for his own use what a blunder he had made arriving at maturity and going off to serve his adopted country in the land of his ancestors was enough to make him wonder whether he was not being betrayed by everything about him for the white race would not accept him as one of its own and the black virtually repudiated him jean veneuse feeling that existence is impossible for him without love proceeds to dream it into being he proceeds to dream it alive and to produce verses when the question is put directly then the white man agrees to give his sister to the blackbut on one condition you have nothing in common with real negroes you are not black you are extremely brown this procedure is quite familiar to colored students in france society refuses to consider them genuine negroes the negro is a savage whereas the student is civilized youre us  coulanges tells him and if anyone thinks you are a negro he is mistaken because you merely he knows that enraged by this degrading ostracism mulattoes and negroes have only one thought from the moment they land in europe to gratify their appetite for white women the majority of them including those of lighter skin who often go to the extreme of denying both their countries and their mothers tend to marry in europe not so much out of love as for the satisfaction of being the master of a european woman and a certain tang of proud revenge enters into this and so i wonder whether in my case there is any difference from theirs whether by marrying you who are a european i may not appear to be making a show of contempt for the women of my own race and above all to be drawn on by desire for that white flesh that has been forbidden to us negroes as long as white men have ruled the world so that without my knowledge i am attempting to revenge myself on a european woman for everything that her ancestors have inflicted on mine throughout the centuries what a struggle to free himself of a purely subjective conflict i am a white man i was born in europe all my friends are white there are not eight negroes in the city where i live i think in french france is my religion i am a european do you understand i am not a negro and in order to prove it to you i as a public employee am going to show the genuine negroes the differences that separate me from them indeed read the book again and you will be convincedmonsieur veneuse has native bearers he has a young negro girl in his house and to the negroes who seem downcast that he is leaving he feels that the only thing for him to say is please go away please go away you see    how unhappy it makes me to leave you please  go now i will not forget you i am leaving you only because this is not my country and i feel too alone here too empty too deprived of all the comfort that i need but that you luckily for you do not yet require  when we read such passages we cannot help thinking of felix eboue unquestionably a negro who saw his duty quite differently in the same circumstances jean veneuse is not a negro and does not wish to be a negro and yet without his knowledge a gulf has been created there is something indefinable irreversible there is indeed the that within of harold rosenberg  louist achille said in his report to the international conferences of  insofar as truly interracial marriage is concerned one can legitimately wonder to what extent it may not represent for the colored spouse a kind of subjective consecration to wiping out in himself and in his own mind the color prejudice from which he has suffered so long it would be interesting to investigate this in a given number of cases and perhaps to seek in this clouded motivation the underlying reason for certain interracial marriages entered into outside the normal conditions of a happy household some men or some women in effect by choosing partners of another race marry persons of a class or a culture inferior to their own whom they would not have chosen as spouses in their own race and whose chief asset seems to be the assurance that the partner will achieve denaturalization and to use a loathsome word deracialization among certain people of color the fact that they are marrying someone of the white race seems to have overridden every other consideration in this fact they find access to complete equality with that illustrious race the master of the world the ruler of the peoples of color   w we know historically that the negro guilty of lying with a white woman is castrated the negro who has had a white woman makes himself taboo to his fellows it is easy for the mind to formulate this drama of sexual preoccupation and that is exactly the ultimate goal of the archetype of uncle remus brer rabbit who represents the black man will he or will he not succeed in going to bed with the two daughters of mrs meadows there are ups and downs all told by a laughing goodnatured easygoing negro a negro who serves with a smile during the time when i was slowly being jolted alive into puberty i had the honor of being able to look in wonder on one of my older friends who had just come back from france and who had held a parisian girl in his arms i shall try to analyze this problem in a special chapter talking recently with several antilleans i found that the dominant concern among those arriving in france was to go to bed with a white woman as soon as their ships docked in le havre they were off to the houses once this ritual of initiation into authentic manhood had been fulfilled they took the train for paris but what is important here is to examine jean veneuse to this end i shall resort in considerable measure to a study by germaine guex la nevrose dabandon contrasting what she calls the abandonment neurosis which is preoedipal in nature to the real postoedipal conflicts described by orthodox freudians dr guex analyzes two types the first of which seems to illustrate the plight of jean veneuse it is this tripodthe anguish created by every abandonment the aggression to which it gives rise and the devaluation of self that flows out of itthat supports the whole symptomatology of this neurosis we made an introvert of jean veneuse we know characterologically or better phenomenologicallythat autistic thinking can be made dependent on a primary introversion me for the white race would not accept me as one of its own and the black virtually repudiated me that is precisely my position® the attitude is one of recrimination toward the past devaluation of self incapability of being understood as he would like to be listen again to jean veneuse who can describe the desperation of the little hottentots whose parents in the hope of making real frenchmen of them transplant them to france too early from one day to the next they are locked into boarding schools these free joyful children for your own good as their weeping parents tell them i was one of these intermittent orphans and i shall suffer for it throughout my life at the age of seven i and my introduction to learning were turned over to a gloomy school far out in the country    the thousand games that are supposed to enliven childhood and adolescence could not make me forget how painful mine were it is to this schooling that my character owes its inner melancholy and that fear of social contact that today inhibits even my slightest impulses    m and yet he would have liked to be surrounded enclosed he did not like to be abandoned when school vacations came all the other boys went home alonenote that word alonehe remained in the big empty white school    oh those tears of a child who had no one to wipe them    he will never forget that he was apprenticed so young to loneliness  a cloistered existence a withdrawn secluded existence in which i learned too soon to meditate and to reflect a solitary life that in the end was profoundly moved by triflesit has made me hypersensitive within myself incapable of externalizing my joys or my sorrows so that i reject everything that i love and i turn my back in spite of myself on everything that attracts me  what is going on here two processes i do not want to be loved why not because once very long ago i attempted an object relation and i was abandoned i have never forgiven my mother because i was abandoned i will make someone else suffer and desertion by me will be the direct expression of my need for revenge i will go to africa i do not wish to be loved and i will flee from loveobjects that germaine guex says is called putting oneself to the proof in order to prove something i do not wish to be loved i adopt a defensive position and if the loveobject insists i will say plainly i do not wish to be loved devaluation of self indeed yes quences for one thing it keeps the individual in a state of profound inner insecurity as a result of which it inhibits or falsifies every relation with others it is as something that has the right to arouse sympathy or love that the individual is uncertain of himself the lack of affective selfvaluation is to be found only in persons who in their early childhood suffered from a lack of love and understanding jean veneuse would like to be a man like the rest but he knows that this position is a false one he is a beggar he looks for appeasement for permission in the white mans eyes for to him there is the other affective selfrejection invariably brings the abandonmentneurotic to an extremely painful and obsessive feeling of exclusion of having no place anywhere of being superfluous everywhere in an affective sense  i am the other is an expression that i have heard time and again in the language of the abandonmentneurotic to be the other is to feel that one is always in a shaky position to be always on guard ready to be rejected and    unconsciously doing everything needed to bring about exactly this catastrophe it would be impossible to overestimate the intensity of the suffering that accompanies such desertion states a suffering that in one way is connected to the first experiences of rejection in childhood and that brings them back in all their strength    the abandonmentneurotic demands proofs he is not satisfied with isolated statements he has no confidence before he forms an objective relation he exacts repeated proofs from his partner the essence of his attitude is not to love in order to avoid being abandoned the abandonmentneurotic is insatiable that is because he claims the right to constant amends he wants to be loved completely absolutely and forever listen he is needed he is loved and yet what fantasies does she really love me does she look at me objectively one day a man came a great friend of daddy ned who had never seen pontaponte he came from bordeaux but good god he was dirty god how ugly he was this man who was such a good friend of daddy ned he had a hideous black face completely black which showed that he must not wash very often looking eagerly for external reasons for his cinderella complex jean veneuse projects the entire arsenal of racial stereotypes onto a child of three or four years and to andree he says tell me andree darling    in spite of my color would you agree to marry me if i asked you  he is frightfully full of doubt here is germaine guex on that subject the first characteristic seems to be the dread of showing oneself as one actually is this is a broad field of various fears fear of disappointing fear of displeasing of boring of wearying    and consequently of losing the chance to create a bond of sympathy with others or if this bond does exist of doing damage to it the abandonmentneurotic doubts whether he can be loved as he is for he has had the cruel experience of being abandoned when he offered himself to the tenderness of others as a little child and hence without artifice jean veneuse does not however lead a life devoid of compensations he flirts with art his reading list is impressive his essay on suares is quite perceptive that too is analyzed by germaine guex imprisoned in himself locked into his artificial reserve the negativeaggressive feeds his feeling of irreparable loss with everything that he continues to lose or that his passivity makes him lack    therefore with the exception of such privileged sectors as his intellectual life or his profession  he cherishes a deepseated feeling of worthlessness where does this analysis lead us to nothing short of proving to jean veneuse that in fact he is not like the rest making people ashamed of their existence jeanpaul sartre said yes teaching them to become aware of the potentials they have forbidden themselves of the passivity they have paraded in just those situations in which what is needed is to hold oneself like a sliver to the heart of the world to interrupt if necessary the rhythm of the world to upset if necessary the chain of command but in any case and most assuredly to stand up to the world jean veneuse is the crusader of the inner life when he sees andree again when he is face to face with this woman whom he has wanted for months and months he takes refuge in silence the eloquent silence of those who know the artificiality of words and acts jean veneuse is a neurotic and his color is only an attempt to explain his psychic structure if this objective difference had not existed he would have manufactured it out of nothing jean veneuse is one of those intellectuals who try to take a position solely on the level of ideas incapable of realizing any concrete contact with his fellow man is he treated decently kindly humanly only because he has stumbled on some servant secrets he knows those people and he is on guard against them my vigilance if one can call it that is a safetycatch politely and artlessly i welcome the advances that are made to me i accept and repay the drinks that are bought for me i take part in the little social games that are played on deck but i do not allow myself to be taken in by the good will shown me suspicious as i am of this excessive cordiality that has rather too quickly taken the place of the hostility in the midst of which they formerly tried to isolate me he accepts the drinks but he buys others in return he does not wish to be obligated to anyone for if he does not buy back he is a nigger as ungrateful as all the others is someone mean it is simply because he is a nigger for it is impossible not to despise him well it is clear to me that jean veneuse alias rene maran is neither more nor less than a black abandonmentneurotic and he is put back into his place his proper place he is a neurotic who needs to be emancipated from his infantile fantasies and i contend that jean veneuse represents not an example of blackwhite relations but a certain mode of behavior in a neurotic who by coincidence is black so the purpose of our study becomes more precise to enable the man of color to understand through specific examples the psychological elements that can alienate his fellow negroes i will emphasize this further in the chapter devoted to phenomenological description but let us remember that our purpose is to make possible a healthy encounter between black and white jean veneuse is ugly he is black what more is needed if one rereads the various observations of germaine guex one will be convinced by the evidence un homme pareil aux autres is a sham an at tempt to make the relations between two races dependent on an organic unhealthiness there can be no argument in the domain of psychoanalysis as in that of philosophy the organic or constitutional is a myth only for him who can go beyond it if from a heuristic point of view one must totally deny the existence of the organic the fact remains and we can do nothing about it that some individuals make every effort to fit into preestablished categories or rather yes we can do something about it earlier i referred to jacques lacan it was not by accident in his thesis presented in  he violently attacked the idea of the constitutional apparently i am departing from his conclusions but my dissent will be understood when one recalls that for the idea of the constitutional as it is understood by the french school i am substituting that of structureembracing unconscious psychic life as we are able to know it in part especially in the form of repression and inhibition insofar as these elements take an active part in the organization peculiar to each psychic individuality as we have seen on examination jean veneuse displays the structure of an abandonmentneurotic of the negativeaggressive type one can attempt to explain this reactionallythat is through the interaction of person and enviromentand prescribe for example a new environment a change of air it will properly be observed that in this case the structure has remained constant the change of air that jean veneuse prescribed for himself was not undertaken in order to find himself as a man he did not have as his purpose the formulation of a healthy outlook on the world he had no striving toward the productiveness that is characteristic of psychosocial equilibrium but sought rather to corroborate his externalizing neurosis the neurotic structure of an individual is simply the elaboration the formation the eruption within the ego of conflictual clusters arising in part out of the environment and in part out of the purely personal way in which that individual reacts to these influences just as there was a touch of fraud in trying to deduce from the behavior of nini and mayotte capecia a general law of the behavior of the black woman with the white man there would be a similar lack of objectivity i believe in trying to extend the attitude of veneuse to the man of color as such and i should like to think that i have discouraged any endeavors to connect the defeats of jean veneuse with the greater or lesser concentration of melanin in his epidermis this sexual myththe quest for white fleshperpetuated by alienated psyches must no longer be allowed to impede active understandingin no way should my color be regarded as a flaw from the moment the negro accepts the separation imposed by the european he has no further respite and is it not understandable that thenceforward he will try to elevate himself to the white mans level to elevate himself in the range of colors to which he attributes a kind of hierarchy we shall see that another solution is possible it implies a restructuring of the world

shifted his truck into reverse and backed it up to the platform three ancient black men smoking and lounging on the empty railway express wagon got slowly to their feet and slouched over to the edge of the platform one of the ancients taking his pipe from his mouth said hidee russ hidee todays the day aint it russell payton slammed the door of his truck and jumped up on the platform howdy mr lucius howdy yawll yeah todays the day is the twelvethirtyfive on time yep shes on time all right lucius said proudly just checked with mr lasley at the window a little while ago he ceremoniously extracted a large watch from the bib pocket of his overalls and peered at it she should be coming round the curve yonder in about fifteen minutes russell nodded and lifted his hand to the men then crossed the platform and entered the door of the station marked colored he paused in the doorway letting his eyes adjust to the dimness of the small room the four highbacked benches facing the fat unfired stove and the six stools at the little lunch counter in the far corner were empty in the center of the floor a brownstained spittoon was being explored by a dozen flies overhead the ceiling fan hummed lazily and from beyond the ticket window the cricket like clicks of the telegraph keys unsettled the quietness he crossed to the lunch counter slid onto a stool and pressed the little bell atop the counter hello russ howre things going with you i was hoping youd stop in before train time russell looked up at a dark brown skinned woman wearing a starched blue dress and a small white apron who had come out of the adjacent kitchen he was suddenly conscious of the sweat and dirt that streaked his clothes and face he smiled diffidently im okay mae he said howre you the woman lowered her eyes and shrugged her shoulders she began to wipe the counter and to adjust the salt and pepper shakers can i get you anything russ pepsi the woman returned with the drink placed it in front of russell and began to wipe the counter again suddenly she stopped and leaned across the counter the tips of her fingers touching russs arm her wide dark eyes were moist russ i know your mama and billy joe are bringing t g home today and i want to come to the funeral i know your mama partly blames me for t g leaving and she    and she probably wont appreciate me comingbut i want to see him russ i want to see his face again before they put him in the ground what do you think huh think your mama raise cain if i come russell curled his fingers around the cold bottle lifted it to his mouth and took a long swallow in the first place mae aint no body gonna see tgs face he said the box aint gonna be opened but why not  russell raised his voice slightly have you ever seen anybody after theyve been electrocuted well no    me neither but i read about it and it aint pretty i mean when they burn you they burn you and then they just embalm you and lay you in a wooden box to be buried by the state if anybody dont claim your body and we barely scraped together enough money to bring tg home aint none left to lay him out fancy so aint nobody gonna see him as he firmly set the drink down he felt the womans fingers tighten on his arm she said even so russ i still want to come but what about miz payton when she and billy joe caught the train here last monday she barely spoke to me he said itll be okay to come tomorrow mae mama aint gonna say nothingbe too many people around and well hell everybody know tg left here cause the law was after him and not on account of you and the boy yeah but he got into that fight with the sheriff cause he was drunk and he got drunk cause i told him i was pregnant and he thought i was trying to force him  russell saw a tear trembling in the corner of her eye and said quickly how is the boy mae the woman brightened she flashed a quick smile exposing white teeth and sending the tear weaving down her cheek oh hes finehes fine he started in school this year you know dont seem like its been that long since tg left i betcha hes growed a foot since you last saw him russ billy joe comes to see him and me all the time why dont you well mae you know how it is    been working   a bell tinkled behind the woman from beyond the swinging door of the kitchen she raised up off the counter looked over her shoulder then back at russ be back in a minute she said smiling an apology you know how it is when the white folks call us niggers gotta come as she disappeared through the door russ glimpsed a row of white faces at the lunch counter in the white waiting room he picked up his drink turned on his stool and leaned back against the counter when the white folks call us niggers gotta come he rubbed the cold bottle against his face and chuckled not tg he thought not highstepping loudlaughing tg crap tg wouldnt come even when his own daddy called not even when his own daddy lay dying and calling for him a little over two years ago russell shifted the cold bottle to the other side of his face and stared  out through the dirty flyspecked window at twin steel tracks remembering how they had whined underneath him as they sped him to chicago to find tg and bring him back to his daddy    he was tired and short tempered when he knocked on tgs door the train ride to chicago had been long and the elevated ride to the south side confusing he didnt like the hard noisy chicago night he didnt like the dim cluttered foulsmelling hallway in which he was now standing he didnt like having to leave home while his daddy lay dying he pounded on tgs door okayokay hold tight im coming the door inched open a cautious eye peered out from the darkness yeah who is it its me tg open the damn door the eye blinked then widened and the door swung open russ russ whatre you doing here man come in come in russ moved past tg into the middle of the room stopped and turned extending his hand toward tg in the dimness he saw tg keeping his right hand concealed behind him quickly edge along the wall to a bureau in the corner of the room he heard a heavy thud as he saw tg lean against an open drawer then close it turn on your lights tg russ said what the hells the matter with you tg clicked on the lights dressed only in his underwear and barefooted he advanced and stuck out his hand they embraced awkwardly and stepped back smiling sheepishly at each other russ looked at his brother at the receding hairline and the whiskeyreddened eyes at the wide mouth now curling upwards in a grin at the tall underfed looking body that now shifted nervously in the center of the room and anger welled up in him he clamped his teeth together and jerked his eyes away from his brother and looked around the room they swept past the bare wall and single chair past the bureau lined with whiskey and wine bottles and halted at the bed where a woman huddled under a blanket her hair in disarray her eyes heavy with sleep tg looked from russs face to the bed and laughed he waved russ to the chair and said wait a minute brer ill get rid of her and then well talk he crossed to the bed and shook the woman roughly cmon get up he said go somewhere and come back later me and my brers gotta talk what is this the woman said what the hell     russ said let it go tg we can go someplace else oooh no tg laughed shes getting up and getting out of here he reached for the blanket that the woman clutched under her chin russ stood up quickly and turned his back to the bed trying to ignore the torrent of hot words flowing between tg and the woman he wandered over to the bureau picked up a bottle of whisky tumbled some into a glass and took a swallow attracted by a flicker of light he glanced downward in an almost closed drawer he saw a silver plated pistol glinting coldly and menacingly on a pile of rumpled shirts like a coiled rattler sunning on a pile of rocks a chill swept over him and he felt the muscles tighten across his shoulders he twirled the glass in his hands his mind conjuring up fearful pictures of tg and the gun he was unaware that the woman had slipped out of the room until he heard tgs laughterfilled voice he wheeled around and said cmon tg pack your stuff were going home tg flopped across the bed laughing now hold tight brer i aint going noplace whatre you talking about anyway didnt you get my letter naw well i wrote and told you to come home right away daddys hurt tg he was plowing for mr campbell and fell off the tractor hes    well    the doctor says he wont last long and he wants to see you so cmon start packingtg rose from the bed and crossed to the bureau he picked up a bottle of whiskey tilted it to his lips and took the bottle back to the bed with him tell me russ he said hows mama and billy joe theyre all okay and mae and your little boy is too now lets go we can talk about em on the way home tg took a long drink from the bottle and laid back across the bed with the bottle resting on his bare chest he stared up at the ceiling and said softly that mae shes okay i guess shes pretty mad at me huh i guess shes pretty mad at me about the baby and everything huh he made circles on his chest with the bottle russ stood up abruptly cmon man i told you wed talk about it later cant you understand daddys dying he might even be dead already brer you know i cant go back down there what about that sonnuvabitching sheriff i beat the hell out of uhuh not me i aint fixing to go to nobodys jail never daddy got the sheriff to drop that warrant on you over a year ago i told you about it in the letter tg laughed you think id trust that sheriff you think hes gonna forget about that whipping this nigger gave him uhuh brer i aint going he raised the bottle to his lips again youre going all right even if i have to drag you russ said he strode across the room to the partly open door of a closet and flung it open he rummaged in the darkness and found a battered suitcase hurling it into the center of the room he began to jerk clothes from the racks he stalked back into the room and pitched the clothes on the bed start getting dressed he ordered tg sat up on the bed didnt you hear me man i told you i aint going whats the matter with you tg russ shouted taking a step toward tg and fighting down his anger stop acting like a fool whats the matter with you suddenly tg scooted back to the middle of the bed and stood up his feet disappearing in the softness of the mattress his laughter bouncing off the walls the bed springs protested at the sharp weight and for a second he reeled on his unsteady foundation his bare chest heaving his bare legs trembling gripping his shorts with one hand he pointed the whiskey bottle at russ with the other whats the matter with me well ill tell you nothings the matter with me nothing the whole thing is nothing me wanting to see daddy aint nothing him wanting to see me aint nothing him dying aint nothing home aint nothing mama and billy joe and mae and the boy aint nothing he took a tottering step to the edge of the bed and bent over resting his palms on his knees he shoved his face into russs and said you know why aint nothing nothing brer cause i aint nothing and you aint nothing and russ slapped him hard tg fell back across the bed the whiskey bottle spinning out of his hand and crashing on the floor as russ grabbed for him tg twisted out of his reach and bolted for the bureau he jerked the the drawer open and whirled with the pistol glinting coldly in his hand as russs fist cracked against his jaw sending him crumbling to the floor russ stooped over and picked up the gun then went to the chair and sat down breathing heavily limply holding the pistol he gazed at tg trying to sort out his thoughts and stifle his anger this was tg his brother this was tg who used to make the house ring with laughter who could even tease chuckles out of his usually somberfaced mama this was tg who billy joe adored dogging his tracking all over the farm this was tg his highstepping big brother russ felt the tears streaming down his face and swiped at them with the back of his hand as he dimly watched tg struggle to his feet are you going tg he asked softly lets go home man and forget all this tg shook his head and grimly laughed as he stumbled to the bed i already done told you russ i aint going russ got up walked over to the bed and stood looking down at tg he shook his head slowly from side to side i just dont know he said i just dont know all i know is im going home he tossed the pistol down beside tg and turned starting for the door he opened the door and looked back his mouth forming a last plea tg was sitting crosslegged in the middle of the bed with the pistol stuck in the waist band of his shorts his eyebrows were arched his lips curled upwards his eyes flashed mocking sparks he said aint nothing nothing brer russ closed the door and started down the narrow hallway he had to get home he wouldnt tell them what had happened hed tell them that tg had moved and couldnt be found hey russ its just about train time she oughtta be coming round the curve anytime now bringing tg home russ smiled at the old black man who had stuck his head in the waiting room door okay mistah lucius ill be right out but he still waited at the lunch counter wanting a last word with mae who had gone to serve some white folks in the other waiting room she had been tgs girl and he wanted to assure her that it would be all right for her to come to the funeral it had been she trembling and crying who had shown him the copy of a chicago negro newspaper whose headlines shouted copkiller to die in electric chair tonight below the headlines was a picture of tg with his head thrown back and his teeth flashing russ frowned erasing the picture from his mind deciding not to wait any longer for mae he rose from the stool and went through the door out into the bright mississippi afternoon he squinted down the railroad tracks the signal light had changed from green to red a motley crowd slightly larger than that of the towns regular trainmeeters had gathered on the platform like cattle shifting in the wind they turned looking obliquely at russ he brushed ineffectually at the dirt on his clothes and moved away from the people squatting on the edge of the platform out of the corner of his eye he saw the old man lucius approaching the old man sat down beside russ with his feet dangling over the platform edge they both sat silently looking down the tracks a car with a red light on top wheeled off the street and swung into a parking space near the platform the car door opened and the sheriff got out and headed for the platform suddenly the rails began to hum and pop from around the curve the train appeared like a large red and black caterpillar steadily growing larger russ jumped down from the platform and walked around his truck he checked each tire kicking it viciously
