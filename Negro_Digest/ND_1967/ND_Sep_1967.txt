inregard to the human rights struggle i see the negro college as a sp ecial institution isee the negro college as standing in u peculiar relationship to that struggle iam often told that this is a pred ominantly negro college not anegro college  they mean that there are  per cent or  per cent negroes etc isay this is a negro college meaning by that that prec isely because of the black predominance there is a prevailing ethos which pervades the negro college campus an ethos distinctive to that campus this ethos this spirit if you please comes precisely out of the context of black experience black tradition black heritage this ethos is a function of the fact that most of the black students in that college come from a particular so cio­cultural environment characterized by its deliberate exclusion from benefits and services of the larger society this environment this exclusion this resultant ethos cannot be treated as if they did not exist or as if they were not relevant they are precisely relevant to the kinds of courses we offer to the kinds of faculty we hire to the kinds of administrators we hire to the kinds of goals we seek in our haste and quest to make middle­class people out of black students we have probably overlooked the f act that those black people have insights that we should heed insights indeed not only about themselves and their background but insights about the nature of this society in which we live and i am suggesting that perhaps we have constructed an academic curriculum on some assumptions we have not been entitled to make such as  the desirability of the middle class goal  the efficacy of white­oriented control  the desirability of a calm objective posture vis­a­vis civil_rights i say that we must start now to tum to black people students faculty etc to find out what their insights tell us about what kind of college we should have to tell us to explain that black­oriented ethos so that we might hopefully become more relevant let me cite professor kenneth b clark on n this in an article he wrote in ebony for august  this article is based upon the assumption that it is possible for an american negro social psychologist to understand certain aspects of the american culture and the psychology of whites with somewhat more clarity than is generally possible f or whites who are accepted by and completely identified with this culture    it is possible    that a negro who has been trained in the discipline of the social sciences may be less influeenced by certain subj ective distortions which are operative in the american culture or he may bring to his view of this culture certain counterbalancing distortions the negro in america by virtue of the pervasive patterns of racial rejection exclusion or a token and often self­conscious acceptance by a minority of white liberals has been farced into a degree of alienation and detachment which has resulted in a pattern of social and personality consequences among these consequences has been sharpened insights and increa sed sensitivity to some of the subtle forces which are significan t in our complex social structure we would prefer to reject or overlook these words of professor clark because they are revolution ary they challenge they require us to reexamine some of our established beliefs and values and traditions and assumptions but i propose a black college revolutionary inits purposesrevolutionary in its procedures revolutionary in its goals i propose a black college which would be for the first time legitimate vis­a­vis that distinctive ethos not in relation to a larger white anachronistic middle­class i propose a black college that would quickly understand that western technology is not the criterion of greatness advanced technology is merely the development of material comfort yes and expanded life but of what value is that comfort if the citizens in the black belts and the black ghettos are systematically denied it no human society would do that only a sub­human one and i do not propose a college that would graduate students into sub­humanity of what value is the knowledge of medicine that extends life when political decision makers snuff out lives of defenseless women and children in vietnam oh no no human society would do that only a basically sub­human one and so i am not impressed with the advanced technology the skyscrapers the gigantic communications systems the modern sanitary facilities when i see the lack of nj odernity in that societys relationship to oppressed peoples i am not impressed with a  society where in black college graduates with one year of postgraduate work can expect a lifetime earning of  while a white male high school graduate can expect to earn  i propose a black college that would do many broad things educationally    it would not be bound in all disciplines and especially my own of political science by the basically irrelevant gres for so long we know that higher education has not dealt with the role and function of the black man in america now they are trying to catch up to become relevant some law schools are adding courses on landlord and tenant before it was only corporations and property some schools are scurrying around trying to establish urban studies centers as if they can research their way to a relevancy to the ghetto i propose a black college that would not only study the ghetto but get its stud ents from there that would prepare its students to go back there to assume roles of leadership i propose a black college with specific courses in economics e g economic coops in the ghetto political science e g viable political movements in the ghetto business administration eg the business potential of the ghetto etc i propose a black college that would offer summer and other­season in­service training for students who would prepare themselves for leadership in the ghetto communities by living in and organizing in those communities i propose a black college that would make the history of african civilization at least a three year course and required for graduation i propose a black college whose curriculum goal would be relevancy to the lives of the students and their experiences i would not be concerned about the question  about the gres or the question  what kinds of jobs would your graduates be prepared to perform these questions would not concern me because they are embedded in the context and parochialism of yesterday and today i am talking modernization i am talking tomorrow and tomorrow we know that only those with relevant educations will be able to save this sick society from chaos my graduates would be called upon because they and only they would be the true dr doctors the larger society has failed to meet the needs of the ghettos we know that some time ago mr henry nichols of the philadelphia school board its vice­chairman  said that  per cent of the black high school graduates in that city are fun ctionally illiteratethis results he said  from the fact that phi ladelphia has in effect two school systems one for the black ghetto the other for the white society i propose a black college that would graduate students to go to that city and hundreds like that one and organize to challenge and change that despicable situation i propose a bl ack college that would deliberately strive to inculate a sense of racial pri de and anger and concern in its students i propose a black college where one of the criteria for graduating summa cum laude would be the demonstrated militancy of the candidate this may all sound silly it may sound ou of order but you see i operate fromthe point of view that too many of us have been inorder for too long i propose a black college that wouldbea felt dominant force in the community in which it exists a college which would useitsaccumulated intellectual knowledge and econcmic resources to bring about desired changes in race relations in the community a college that wotld offer free remedial training and education for black adults and school drop­outs a college that would be intimate friends notfoe to the black citizens surrounding it a college that would do business only with thosewho hired its students and contributed a certain predetermined amount to the colleges scholarship fundsi propose a black college that would embark on these programs not fearful of reprisals because the college i propose vould seek its raison detre not in the sanction and approval of others but in the sanction and approval of its black students and their black parents and again i know the question will come where will you get the money what foundations or governments will support you my answer may seem naive but i would rather close down my college than cut down on my principles if that cut meant kow­towing to those public or private who would impose unacceptable conditions on their grants because you see in the final analysis only a man who is his own man can be a legitimate man i propose a college that would insist first on being its own manbefore it attempted to go into the business of educating men and women i propose a black college whose faculty and administrators would be on fire with the desire to eradicate human injustice a college whose faculty and administrators would reject the shibboleths of objectivity and aloofness  because they would know that these are merely synonyms for passivity and irrelevancy i propose a black college then that would adopt as its preamble the avowed purpose to pose the hard questions to challenge established myths a college that would  feel ashamed of itself if its graduates did not become active fighters for human dignity and social justice a college that would recruit as students those freedom fighters ­in the same way that some collegestoday recruit football players i propose a black college that would grant honorary degrees to the paul robesons and john hulletts of lowndes county  to the amzi moores of cleveland mississippi to the mr mcclains of nottingham penna i propose a black college that would hire a fannie lou hamer and welfare mothers as professors of social action a college where ferment was a reality not superficial rhetoric a college that would see an alex melton of west chester and charles butler of coatesville as  times more legitimate in community organization than  full professors of political science and sociology from harvard yale or princeton i propose a black college that would recognize and utilize the talents of these people as surely as some colleges now bargain for irrelevant phds it is clear in my mind that there are very few legitimate places in this society where we can expect militant outspoken protest to originate the negro college must fill that vacuum it must be relevant in a way that the church has not been in a way that labor unions have not been in a way that socalled liberal groups have not beenthe primary role of the students at that college is to be a student to study to prepare frankly i do not expect the students to be on the front line action actively leading that time for them will come later the active leadership should come from the faculty and administration that is why this human rights leadership course this year stressed teaching and studying there are no exams in this course the test will come when the students have already graduated and are living day­to­day in their respective communities how will they relate to that discriminatory school board how will they fight discriminatory employers and real estate brokers these will be the tests and i assure you no greater no more important examinations will be taken in our time and people will ask  what about accreditation and i will answer our relevancy and legitimacy will accredit us how crtditable can the present system be when it cripples hundreds of thousands of black students annually my final thoughts are these i am quite sure that we are in a stage of history which is confusing and bothersome to many people it is a stage of dynamism calling for militancy not moderation calling for manhood not mediocrity the old language the old cliches must be thrown aside we must not follow the philosophy of edmund burke and be afraid to make changes we must challenge the future and reject the past we must not cannot march into tomorrow on the drum beats of yesterday we must march to a dif­ f erent drummer we must not approach these burning issues as if yesterdays formulas were valid we must exp eriment we must innovate we must declare our modernity and our manhood there will be those who will accuse us of being hatersthey will accuse us of being segregationists we will be accused of being passionate and subjective and intolerant and they will be right we must be haters of injustice we must segregate ourselves from ignorance we must be passionate about our desire our will to be men we must be intolerant of all those who would counsel caution the negro college is oneof americas few legitimate bastions of relevancy if it fails there will be created a vacuum of leadership not to befilled in this or succeeding generations the problem is ju st that serious the burden is just that great i gave a talk at northem illinois university in dekalb illinois recently and some one asked if you are so alienated why dont you and your kind leave the country there are many answers to this but the most important one is this country needs its alienated people in point of real fact ­going back to kenneth clarkwe have insights that can help save this society that can help civilize this essentially sub­human society this is a job for the militant not the moderate not the middle­ofthe­roader protect your relevancy with a passion and centuries from now history will record oh yes in the latter half of the th century the most meaningful voices came from the black college campuses those voices those campuses were intune with the future they perf ormed the function of clarity and conscience they pointed up viable alternatives when many others slinked low and proceeded cautiously the black colleges were the avant gard e the black colleges provided the insights that got the society through a terrible turbulent period and that historical account will be very very correct
the afroamerican student is currently being swept up by the whirl pool of a merican  racism he is continuously confronted with degrading  images of his self and supremacist images of whitesin many cases the  feeling of inferiority is instilled as early as age three through the childsfamily and environment later the elementary and high schools reinforce inferiority feelings to such an extent that by the time the afro­american youth is a freshman in college all that is needed to complete this black automaton of inferiority is the embellishments of academic manifestations of racism hence a charlatan carbon copy bourgeois is molded with superficial thoughts of individuality steeped in judeo­christian pragmatic concepts such as competitiveness is the thing the bourgeois negro is too sophisticated to stab his brother on friday night liberalistic subtlety bestowed upon them by their synthetic teachers only allows them to run away from their brothers their crudeness and their horrible rat­infested environment to be a black bourgeois is to be at once trying to become vice­king of the whites dunghill and acting like the fly with rape in mind on the elephants back in the afro­american students quest to reject himself and his brothers he loses what potential power he has he begins to conceive of power as a cadillac a light­skinned straight­haired wife a suburban home and a perfunctory job with some white supercorporation power becomes the pursuit of happiness  where happiness is material wealth designed to be obsolete in a matter of a few years money is the manifestation of power they fail to see that the richest black american can be eliminated by any white person who calls him a nigger his humanity is nullified through that one act the students mental energies are expended attempting to secure the proper image mannerisms voice characteristics and sexual attitudes of their white colonizers they are constantly restraining from exposing their primitiveness  that is their soulfu lness their sexual life istom asunder trying to hold on to the judeochristian concept of spirituality sansfleshbut beingblack does not makeevery young afro­american frivolously frenetic the rise of militancy there are those afro­american brothers and sisters who are becoming increasingly aware of themselves and of the depth of racism of america many of the blackmilitant students frequently of middle class background­ can be physically identified by their proud carriage and naturalafro hair style the black militant student frequently is a science or psychology major comparatively few political science and humanities students become militant thereare reasons for this it appears thatthe political awakening of a black student varies inversely with the amount of exposure he has had with academic political science and humanities the less he is exposed to it thewestern political and humanitiesscene the more his political potentiality seems to have a chance of becoming actualizedwestern political and humanitarian thought is entangled in the briarbush of objectivity and individuality in the naive or nonaware black students quest to be less sinful and evil that is to be less black he assimulates and acculturates he becomes more of an american than the white man in his drive to be white he overcompensates ultimately he becomes an apolitical being aloofly viewing the world from the underside of the white mans pulverizing ivory tower the non­aware black student becomes narcissistically infatuated with gaining knowledge of the world whereas in many cases the non­aware black student who is a science major will have the po tential to absorb various types of political and cultural systems more unbiasedly than the arts student he is potentially able to visualize contradictions within the american society because of his acquired ability to reason deductively the rise of black militancy means that students must consolidate a pr ogrammatic national approach to their particular needs and goals within the black liberation movement they must communicate frequently with one another for this to be eff ective the militant black student needs a central point of view and dissemination what is needed is a national afro­american student association which initially serves as a clearing house for communication   and national coordination this type of structure allows for a diversified but cohesive approach so necessary for the liberation struggle black student groups must approach their particular problems through a national and world viewpoint we must begin to realize that racism prevails everywhere in the world in many different forms students at tuskegee institute use techniques of liberation suited to alabamas style of racism while angolan students use other techniques nationalizing the black student movement brings a sense of black solidarity the student as black militant grassroots or no roots the black students role in the movement is vital and varied first of all he must continue his education dropping out of school to work in the movement in many cases is romantic escapism from a reality difficult to face up to because we have less than six per cent of our high school graduates going to college and more than half of that number female we have to try to keep brothers from dropping out if the school is not educating well and the student realizes it dropping out wont solve the problem and he will not get the necessary technical education in the movement or on the streets we are almost obligated to stay at a jive bourgeois college and attempt to   get as much information out of its educational f acilities as possible and  attempt to reveal to untogether brothers and sisters the real happenings in the world or if at a white college the students have accessto all kinds of information from their library and other sources not ordinarily available to blacks the black student as militant must know how to identify and communicate with himself and his brothers in the street in most cases from whence he came he must be willing to sacrifice and to assu me responsibilities howard universitys newly formed black_power committee has issued aims that can be adopted by black students on the whole the overthrow of the negro college with white innards  to raise in its place a militant black university which will counteract the white­washing black students now receive in negro and white institutions   our goals revolve around the complete revamping of the negro college moreover wemust have a complete overhauling of the pres­ ent curricula and the building of courses of study more pertinent to the present and future demands of the black struggle in america and the world   at the same time it is necessary to launch a vigorous campaign to change the names of black un  vers  t  es to commemorate the courage and deeds of black thinkers and theonsts   the feasibility of converting fed erally funded howard into a black militant university is another story what is more important is that the brothers at howard appear to be ready to deal with the issues for example to deplore the vietnam war and overdraf ting of black americans is not enough we must begin to form alternatives to the draft black students can help in setting up local black draft and recruitment centers where brothers and sisters can come to join the black army which will initially be fighting a nonphysical wadare that is voter registration psychological warf are organizing political blocs freedom troops for the work in the backwoods of the south and the north etc another goal of campus organizing should be to encourage students to continue their education for the sake of building an intellectual communitythat would turn create an ideologyof black liberation for america and subsequentlyfor the bandung third  world campus chapters of the afroamerican student association will need a pan­hellenic committee to find ways to utilize the black fraternal orders which are national in scope and black in body it has been shown that as black racial relevancy becomes accepted by the students as their position the black greek orders initially for selfish reasons want to participate in the movement when the localfrat chapter begins to see the seriousness of racism and the need to have a sense of self­awareness then it is time to put its power and unity to work militant students should not fall into the trap of just condemning black greek orders for their bourgeois behavior they must be shown their contradictory stand and what role they can play in the movement as a fraternity another goal should be finding methods to achieve better understanding and cooperation between afro­americans and africans even today there is a tremendous amount of reciprocal animosity between black americans and africans achieving this goal is a long and arduous task that will take years of re­education and personal contact black students on white campuses the militant blacks who go to white schools must suffer through a frustrating dilemma their soulfulness will be forced out of them and sucked by those weird apolitical ofay radicals to add salt to the wound the black students on white campuses frequently have to try to develop miles and miles from soulville a black community  as a result they tend to overintellectualize and romanticize the struggle so that when they come home it is often difficult for them to relate to the harsh nonintellectual and very unromantic ghetto reality the prevailing hang­ups of black militants on white campuses are of ten due to association with the new white left the new left is apolitical because of its p ragmatic mindless outlook which makes them shirk their necessary theoretical duties being the most tangible and immediate model of radicalism many new left concepts are adopted by the militant blacks they get caught in vicious rhetorical arguments about academic nationalism and other esoteric trivia to help clear the air of these consequences the militant black students should   communicate more with the nationalist brothers in the black communities  correspond andor visit the black colleges which have miitant groups and   take some of the vacation time to work with some nitty­gritty community group in this way the amount of abstract objective intellectualiza tion of black reality will be kept at a minimum a final word as we have seen before his power can be utilized the black student must find himself and then deal with the hang­ups and pitfalls of being black in americahe is forced not to be pragmaticmindless within a pragmatically paranoid society he is compelled to be theoretical when society dictates anti­intellectualism in short the black student is swimming upstream with weighted boots he must strugglewith his bourgeoisaspiring brothers who arein the vast majority and yet he must come to grips with endemic racism the black student should under­ stand his relationship to and his usage of violence the violence within us should be channelled for positive intellectual development the violence within us should not be contained in the senseof the judeo­christian concept of containment displacing aggression we neither havethe time nor the need to displace our aggression fists and brains go politicallytogether in the make­up of a militant intellectual in orderto substantiate our theoretical and therefore intellectual positions we must oftentimesflex our physical muscles inshort wemust fight our use of the various levels of violence dependsonour knowledgeof political expediency timing we have to view the future from a probabilistic basis the way we actualize our theories is dependent upon what we expect to gain from its specific use if we use method x or y  we must know its consequences and alternatives we cannot forget that struggling for survival is no game the oppressor knows this violence is no toy violence plays a vital role in the colonialists strategies of dominance  where political sophistication subtlely bludgeons the oppressed into a state of almost hereditary despondency indeed when we begin to utilize our various levels of action we must never forget that america has institutionalized violence to the extent that it is strategically generated by and through its culture this is one of the reasons for example why sncc failed to successfully politicalize lowndes county alabama  they were playing romantic games while the system computerized their most probable routes of action what does this mean to the afro­american student america is not the world and racism does not confine itself to america ultimately it means that the af ro­a merican student m u st think he must observe analyze and synthesizeand yet he must be subjective enough to allow his spirituality to grow and become functional in the strain toward racial relevancy and black liberation indeed  to be black is not enough and to be bitter is not enough to know of our magnificent black heritage is still not enough we must become dedicated militant human beings continuously questioning the roots of society in a word black humani  sm
throughout our land a sad voice tells of a terrifying loss regardless of the  mourners words to the contrary we know that they suffer an unspeakable grief  for you do not lose a habit a friend or even a god with out learning something about pain life and death of ten this new knowledge forces us to look inward seeking a new arrangement of the old familiar feelings and thoughts in order to find strength to carry on with this thing called living for life must be lived and somehow we know that joy will follow pain most men have this faith and meet their days with this belief yet there is the voice that tells of a great lossgod has died and man must create and find him anewi n  free to live free to die holt rinehart and winston  by malcolm boyd we hear the voice of an episcopal priest who now functions as chaplain­at­large to u s university students boyd has left the established sanctuary of the suburban church to become a part of the alienated and by the alienated i mean the beat crowd the hippies and the negro whose alienation from american society began with his arrival on these unhappy shores boyd goes beyond these groups though he tells us about the middle­class plodders and the jet­set covering such a vide range of social types his ministry seems to have taken on a one­man­personal­contact­type billy grahamcrusade perhaps it is not the people with whom he associates that marks him but the way he seesthem and he sees them through the eyes heart and mind of an adolescent such a perspective regardless of the personal intentions or sentiments is unbecoming tragic and sterile lets look at this new breed of minister he usually is disgusted frustrated and spiritually tortured by the middle­class congregation he serves he finds that his congregation is more concerned with buildings organs pews and missionary work in far­off­places where good is effortlessly and safely done his congregation can be stirred to great compassion and a few tears by the suffering of the oppressed hungarians the starving indians and the brutalized vietnamese the negros hostility violence and voiced hatreds have all placed him beyond the pale of the deserving for in order to receive christian charity the recipient must be humble deserving and eternally grateful to his benefactor otherwise the benevolent christian receives no confirmation of his goodness and his right to give above all the christian must have his guilt assuaged by the humble gratitude of the recipient the gians are telling us something quite different from what their words imply it has nothing to do with god or gods simply it isthat their world no longer exists this world­view ran roughshod over most conflicts and indictments the world was soon to be cast in the mold of the legendary revered peacefulness and righteousness of wellington ohio or any ice­cream­social saturday here mothers were loved beyond reason and human capacity protestant churches exhorted sinners in abstract irrelevant terms making sure that none was offended nor saved for all in all god not only smiled on the town square but favored it above all other squares  ­ name of the game is im the boss and dont you forget it it is no wonder that few young men enter the ministry todayfrom those who have we hear that god is dead you cannot help but wonder how ministers would be aware of such a death since the majority of them follow their congregations this pronouncement revelation or reasoned conclusion would be hilarious if it were not tragic for it reflects the extremes to which a people will go to preserve a delusion a particular madness that prevents them from confronting themselves with what they are or as it may be from seeing themselves as far too many others see them by announcing the death of god these ministers or theolo the schools were staff ed by ­ dedicated teachers not noted for their intellectual strength but devoted to perpetuating the myth although the social studies taught in these schools was little more than a highly fictionalized romantic rendering of the world and its people it perpetuated the myth it placed the wellington ohios and their values in the center of the uni  verse negroes and all other colored people were viewed as something inferior and naturally god ordained it so these black unfortunates served a good purpose they reaffirmed the myth and all the values surrounding it ironically and outrageously these people believed that everyone else in the world shared this delusion or at least coveted it even today many americans cannot believe that this myth is not shared by all even when told in plain direct language that their myth is the nightmare of others they dismiss the blatant horrible consequences of their myth and speak of the need to communicate and how do two men communicate when one denies the others dignity equality and suffering at the same time the one denied his humanity has learned to hate beyond his own understanding first he learned to hate himself  now finding some pride and selfrespect within himself he has learned to hate the enemy today the enemy happens to be white now the only difference between the white mans hatred for the negro and the negros hatred for the white man is that white hatred has become institutionalized as an acceptable way of life it is seldom spoken except by the not­so­lunatic fringe there are many defenses and arguments given to protect this right to hate such as property rights  not now and thats how people are but to stand and tell a man that you hate him is just not the american way the expression of any true emotion seems to set off a tidal wave of apprehension throughout the land we are far better at hiding our feelings than expressing them consequently we pay the price for this concealment for having never learned to live with our emotions we have learned to be at their mercy this insanity has no bounds and recognizes few contradictions we are quite willing to send our sons and daughters to fight and die for the alleged freedom of a people we would not want to live next door to there have been few south vietnamese refugees settled in this country i wonder what the reaction of our god­fearing anti­communist americans would be if  souh vietnamese refugees were landed in san francisco to be resettled in california or alabama if such were to come to pass we would see riots taking place that would make watts seem like a trip to disneyland and oh the justif ying slogans words and arguments i do not want to give the impression that saturday night in wellington ohiois a second­rate heaven that it is not for as quiet as it is kept the people in wellington are quite human they do all the things that any other people do all of their human acts however never force them to examine themselvesand to discover what they are it isas though all of their human frailties have received divine sanction a blessing thathas been denied all others especially all otherswho differ too significantly fromthe people of wellington some young americansliving in the wellingtons and suburbs of our land are fleeing to hippy­towns and raising hell on university campuses another sanctuary of the polite manner and myth the world being what it is today many young americans know that a great sea exists between what they are told to believe and what they see happening around them this is a crushing and sad experience for the young for youth is a time of dreams hopes and strivings to make the impossible possible the beauty of it is that for young people brotherhood and love are not dreams but luring realities some of these young people have chosen this reality they have denounced the hypocrisy of their leaders and elders in strange and certainly not always sane ways they seek a new world a world that self­interest  fear and the old myth will not permit in their communities it is important to remember that these young people are primarily from middle­class and upper­middle­class families so they do not represent in any large number the negro or any other minority group in america it is also interesting to note that when they are attacked it is their dress and personal hygiene that are denounced their use of drugs often brands them as being irresponsible and no doubt some of them are just as some of the good people in wellington are regarding drugs in america the question is not whether they will be taken but when and under what circumstances for it should be  common knowledge that the use of tranquilizers in this country is probably rivaling aspirin consumption and that is no small habit those young adults experimenting with drugs were introduced to them in their respectable homes in the form of tranquilizers of a thousand varieties what is significant is that few people answer their charges and indictments of society what has all this to do with malcolm boyds ministry mr boyd and all his kin seem to have abandoned the source of the problem the problem resides in all the wellington  ohios and suburban communities in america that drive their young from them if america is to survive it cannot be saved by ministering to a few thousand adolescents and young adults the young adults are running from their homes it would seem that these homes are in need of spiritual rehabilitation if the core is rotten this is where you will find the worn but here it takes courage patience and a dedication that only god can give any minister who sets this as his task must be willing to suffer all the abuse that an irate myth­wed christian can hurl upon him and believe me these christians have been practicing cruelty since they threw the first pagan to the lions to awaken a people to what they are is a thankless task but to show them what they can become and to help them achieve it approaches divine gloryon the other hand for a minister to flee to social limbo and join the outcasts is the easy way out it is the missionary of the pre­world war ii era all over again and no doubt the results will be the same totally irrelevant obviously mr boydmust plan to become an eternal adolescent for in the hippy­joints and other farout places we find the young rarely do we see anold beatnik time cures many things and it inflicts a special malice on the young it is adolescent and uselessly so to tell us that men are free to live and free to die to recite the sufferings of the prostitute the lifebored jet­setter the oppressed negro and other human beings without giving some hope or some explicit value is true abdication of all responsibility to tell us that men suffer is not news many children know this and so do most adults to dream of a better world without moving toward that world is the right of adolescents but it is the bane and tragedy of mature men no it is not the reverend boyds of our generation who give me hope for the future for this kind of ministry discourages hope the battle is not being fought in the village or in the hippy­section of san francisco it is being fought by a few silent souls struggling with their suburban congregations attempting to get across the real meaning of christianity and denocracy the young people on the hippy kick aside from a few lifekilling habits are trying to find themselves they will make it alone unless i am totally wrong there are many who are thankf ul for the boyds his kind of wretched jargon­like prose and meaningless intentions this kind of ministry reassures the establishment that all is well and they need never fear no great threat to life limb or sacred habits will come from the hippy­section the reverend boyds of the world are there if middle­class america represents the strength and backbone of our nation then middle­class america must accept a large part of the responsibility for what is wrong with america and on this score i refer to negroes and whitesfor the time has come when income will probably shape social attitudes just as surely as race of course this only means that negroes can go mad too and heap all the abuse they have suffered on others regardless of the criticisms that we make of the middle­class it provides a large share of american leadership and so­called opinion setters if we are to change social values in america we must start here to start anywhere else is to abandon the problem although it may be a special christian habit to exalt over the conversion of one soul it is a totally irrelevant act belonging to the personal realm what is threatening our very existence as a people and a nation are certain basic attitudes about our fellow men and ourselves it is meaningless except on a very limited personal level to speak of saving a few individuals all the angels in heaven may rejoice but it does not alter our foreign policy our racist attitudes our indifference to poverty and our grasp of what is happening in the world to convert a hippy deserves as much praise as it does to convertan episcopalian to a presbyterian the real conflict and struggle lie within the social attitudes and values that cut across all of these artificialreligious barriers reverend boyds free to live free to die ignores the real battlefield and the real enemy perhaps in fleeing the real challenge of his time he may find and save himself but little else will be salvaged

relation of this story to hughess life and to the cult of the negro can be passed over thematically it presents a conflict between life and art one that need not exist oceolas choices and actions tell us the blues are aligned mostly with life their source and the arbiter of their form art is here represented by a disciplined career devoted to old masters and old forms life by love and marriage and by immersion in duties to ones self and community art is associated with entrenched vealth life with youthful vigor art never transcends life embodied in dora ellsworth art merely offers from its hoard of cash the blandishments of convenience and privilege trying to draw away lifes vitality and induce it to f ollow the rules by which art claims its superiority life in the person of oceola

this austere woman the certainty that what she lost a beautiful life ­­can be found only in art art so good that it is better than most life and better therefore than most people hughes at twenty­one knew that this concept was not true he tossed one form of art his books into the sea the closeness of the blues to sensory life appears in the unforced selectivity of oceolas mind as she summarizes her past for her patron she remembers mobiles delicious roast pig and the large mouth of billy kersands the minstrel leader who let her as a child place both hands inside it the relevance of negro experience to blues and jazz is the point in her recollection that her parents both musicians were run out of town for being dressed up in alabama happy playing either blues or classics she cannot

for a man rather than greatness the pianist responds with the soft and lazy syncopation of a negro blues    oceolas final words chartable according to mood race and sex explain what blues are ellipses

describes them in the big sea the young poet found his first prolonged incentive to tum jazz into poetry music at the grand due obviously inspired to a negro jazz band in a parisian cabaret in the

music which lent its name to the this is the first half of jazzonia a poem apparently written a little after the weary blues  and one of the three shown vachel lindsay it opens with an ecstatic union of sensory and spiritual faculties with vocalic suggestions both rapturous and solemn the next stanza gives dual recognition to the exotic thrust of jazz its then strange extravagance is drawn with cubist sharpness but kept expressively realistic through the picasso­like image of the jazz mens six long heads massed and tilted its sexuality is colorfully emphatic in the enticing dancing girl allusions to eve and cleopatra add depth to the theme of allurement and several interchanges of adjectives before tree and rivers fuse the readers perceptions in apt anticipation of the concluding lines inawhirlingcabaretsix long­headed jazzers play the other poem that impressed vachel lindsay negro dancers  appeared in the crisis in march  its vigor and rhythmical exactness are fully represented by the opening stanza spoken thu after a second stanza on the cabaret atmosphere of the brown­skin steppers  and a third that reads like two snaps of the thumb at white onlookers the poem ends with a repetition of the opening three lines except for the second stanza the poem is notable for its precise rendition of the dance that captured the verve speed and abandon of the jazz age and enthralled paris in the persons of many negro dancers especially josephine baker lenox avenue midnight the next published in the series of hughess best jazz pieces appeared in the weary blues recorded as the expressions of a negro womanit partially explainsjazz the rhythm of lifels a jazz rhythm the second stanza indicates that jazz like rain and street sounds can vaguely mirror human woes the

down the weakest stanza shows the negros longing for the moon and sea as old desire distilled into rhythm the quoted lines and a few others reveal the true distillation jazz made precious by its long and sacrificial birth while writing trumpet player  hughes was fully abreast of the new be­bop music emerging from mintons playhouse in harlemamong the poems inspired by be­bop a rhythmically complex and experimental kind of jazz characterized by dissonance improvisation and unusual lyrics the best is the lead­off dream boogie in m ontage of a dream def erred  keeping up with a changing harlem hughes is alert to the hip insiders elastic jargon as well as the generations­old truth of negro life ­the dream deferred dream boogie perfectly fulfills its purpose wasting no word it has variation in mood ease irony sarcasm and terse jovialty it mixes old devices of the dramatic monologue with a contemporary boogiewoogie beat its rough­hewn grace adds power to its clarity jazz poems can reveal jazz even less than blues poems can reveal the bluesthe strict form of the latter provides some agreement between poet and reader yet followers of bud powell dizzy gillespie thelonious monk and charlie parker can respond with extra enthusiasm and sureness to the be­bop and jazz poems in the public alliance of poetry and music so challenging in the case of jazz poems hughes has been a pioneer on october   he told harry elliott of the lawrence kansas j ournal­world i did poetry reading with a jazz piano including fats waller in harlem friends homes in the early s his reading to glee­club music at princeton in  was part of a more public tradition that he was firmly establishing by then the greenwich village and san francisco beat movement of the late s was an extravagant development of hughess lead ifin his evolution as a poet shown in his  volume hughes was restricting himself to folk material and to experimental and folk art methods a warning mixed with praise in reviews by saunders redding in new york h erald tribune book review march   and by babette deutsch in the new york times book review may   the restriction was purposeful restriction is the subject of the blues the fountainhead of jazz and the tuning fork of the negro soul a true blues or jazz poem is an expression of this very restriction modified by intimations of how negroes transcend it believe ill do a little dancinjust to drive my blues away and oh silver treeoh shining rivers of the soul are exact reflections of negro soul  its supple power to overcome demoralization its gift of recognizing the flow of spirit inside kindred forms to be true the intellectual content of such poems must be aborted  the lazy stomp of a jazz step and the sudden hey pop re­bop interrupt the squash thought and reason in an irrational world of color prejudice for the folk negro to think is not to be  negritttde the negroes own soul­world that centralized hughess purposes in the s is the american counterpart of the burgeoning concept of african negritude launched in the following decade in the magazine black student and developed principally by two writers of african descent  aime cesaire then at the ecole normale superieure and leopold sedar senghor the sorbonne student who was to become president of the republic of senegal african controversy over the term negritude will probably rouse an exploration of its american equivalent yet to be distinguished yet to be named this american negritude once defined and compared with the african personality and the black mans identity as phrases indicative of cesaire and senghor will remain traceable in the works of hughes its foremost exponent if american negritude can be tentatively defined as that complex of traits sensibilities and historical consciousness peculiar to black americans a study of hughess poetry alone can yield the outline of the concept the importance of skin color for example is revealed in negro  me and the mule  nightmare boogie  and letter from spain his earliest soundings of this theme are serious respectful negro  which appeared in the crisis in january  and opened the weary blues identifies the negros darkness with the night and with the depths of my africa it gives negro color specific moral and physical strength dream variations manages to invest negro darkness with a fairyland grace and relaxed beauty in  hughes expressed the world­wide implications of this obvious kind of negritude his letter from spainaddressed to alabama the nine­stanza poem quoted in part in chapter i opens with we captured a wounded moor todayhe was just as dark as me the versified letter shows the quickening bond of color that resolves differences between the dying african and his negro interrogator m ontage included nightmare boogie  opening with the poets seeing a million facesblack as me his dream turns nightmare with a quizzical twist as the f aces all are suddenly dead white and boogiewoogie music is blaring a derisive razzing tone sharpens the anecdotal joviality and hardens the condemnation of color prejudice another component of negritude is related to skin color but not limited to it the sense of a particular beauty possessed by negroes the earliest­printed poem on the subject is my people in the crisis june  a six­line piece which straightf orwardly declares the beauty of negroes faces eyes and souls but the earliest­written poem on the subject is when sue wears red quoted in chapter i in which the sweetness of a brown­faced girl wearing red is made both timeless and regal by references to ancient egypt and its queens the authors most sensuously conceived expression of this theme is harlem sweeties in shakespeare in harlem typical linesflow easilythe softly bouncing rhythmcarries different pulses of adoration the candy­stocking eagerness of manhattan whites touring harlem cabarets and the keatsian rainbow abundance sensed at a negro beauty pageant an important trait encompassed by negritude is durability reflected by dilsey in faulkners the sound and the fury and emphasized by hughes all of his life mother to son  in the crisis december  begins the strong matriarchal portraits found in hughess poetry and fiction this poem using homely images like tacks splinters and tornup boards shows a poor negro woman instilling her own persistence into her son the same unconquerable determination imbues the negro mother  which in  furnished the name for a sequence of goldentair press broadsides decorated by prentiss taylor and marked by hughes with instructions for dramatic recitation the negro mother  which drew a tearf ul platform embrace from mary mcleod bethune when hughes read it at her college shows how the speakers dream like steel in her soul and her faith in a free tomorrow for her races children have helped her endure mistreatment and exhort youngsters to march ever forward breaking down bars in the early s spirituals compares a negro mothers durability to the firmness of tree roots and mountains and still here asserts resistance to all attempts to make the negro speaker stop laughin  stop lovin  stop livin negro durability is elusive to the understanding as a psychic phenomenon and hughes waited till the middle decades of his career as a poet to explore it of the two poems in fields of wonder in which hughes makes this attempt burden shows almost mystically the psychic pang common to negroes oppression adds brief explicationthe dearth of dreamsfor dreamers songs for singers songs that will however break their jails three verses

harlem asks what happens to a dream deferred and gives alternatives it dries up like a raisin in the sunfesters sugars over sags or does it explode ends the poem remembered partly as the source of lorraine hansberrys title for raisin in the sun harlem traces in figurative language the long scar of psychic abuse which might it emphasizesdevelopafatallyeruptive itch an expression of negritude important in the s is the recognition of african heritage hughess poems strongly voicing this heritage however belong mostly to the early years of his career about half were written or published in the early s during the ascendancy of marcus garvey whose weekly negro world extolled african history and whose black star line black madonna black baby dolls and revived backto­africa movement held the attention of much of the world the crisis published three such poems in eighteen months danse africaine august  merges deliberate changing tom­tombeats with wispy whirlsof a dancing girl and the

negroes historical consciousness of their american past its best and its most detailed poetic expressions appear at opposite ends of a thirty­year stretch of creativity in the chapter of the big sea named after the first line of the negro speaks of rivers  hughes tells how and why in the summer of  he wrote this perhaps most often anthologized of his poems one that is a boys testament of love for his race hughes newly aware of the spiritual strength of migrant southern negroes and feeling emotionally cast out by his estranged parents received melancholy inspiration from the sunset gold upon the mississippi he was crossing by train submerging that feeling into thoughts of mighty rivers in his ancestral past an having wrestled all day with the problem of hatred of negroes so vocal in the father who awaited him in mexico he reconciled his isolation in a river­like fusion in which history became rebirth self­justification and veiled prophecy the jines first written on the back of an envelope began the poem thus ive known rivers ive known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins my soulhas grown deep like the rivers i bathed in the

publication of the very detailed prelude to our age several poems employ negro history october   in op p ortunity in  points to negro participation in john browns raid on harpeis ferry as does

itself in hughess works with as much clarity as the national mind brings to the concept basic details stark outlines nuances all are revealed they amass and enliven a tradition as much literary as sociological in its implications and a final aspect of negro soul is widely perceived though seldom fully comprehended  humor according to hughess introduction to the best of n egro h umor    even  negroes especially writers and publishers often undervalue its uses hughess own uses of humor ample in his personal conversation and in much of his work can be only minimally surveyed in this approach to it in the light that it throws on negroes the combined uniqueness and utility of negro humor has long been its power to conceal and transform the uniqueness deriving from the magnitude and the persistence of the concealment the common theme of the mask then has an uncommon significance as expression of negro soul hughes labored early to express his sense of the tightness of the mask when minstrel man appeared in the crisis december   a companion poem the jester  appeared in op p ortunity only minstrel man  discussed in chapter ii does justice to the theme the other poem is too plain an exhortation much later two poemsin one­way ticket life is fine and juice joint  northern city  show how the authors more elastic humor moderates the grimness of the mask in the former poem the mask a shivering protestation that life is fi nefine as wine is clapped on by the speaker after his discovery that suicide in a cold river or from a high window is strenuous here the mask is fitted out of nonracial circumstances but the expression itself mixing blues and boogiewoogie style and italicized racial accent is negro juice joint uses the interruption of a blues song by a sudden dance step to keep the gall from biting in the singers mouth to show the snapping on of the mask af ter the adjustment  the negro women using gestures precisely like those of the singer pearl bailey  switch their

in a harlem gin mill near his st nicholas avenue address hughes received the most authentic comic inspiration of his life he overheard the man who was to become his own fictional jesse b semple

you know white folks dont tell negroes what cranks cranks his notion of a separate white world his engagingly fresh diction while objecting to it became a study of the author during their many later bar­stool conversations while hughes took boswellian notes after the conversations a literary character was being born who represented the flesh and spirit of harlem a folk hero sprung of the common black man he was a whole personality when hughes found himself arguing with him at the typewriter while the worker was miles away his vivid reality on paper now had the dimensions that would earn him

published as whos passing for who in  in negro story for december­january  the story recalls the harlem renascence night that an interracial group had some confused fun brawling meandering and ultimately guessing one anothers racial identities the humor is satirically aimed at the pretensions of the harlem literati and their white friends redheaded iowan stubblefield fightsfor a blonde struck by a negro only to find that she is the mans negro wife the other iowans negroes by their own gradual conf ession declare at the end from their cab were white we just thought wed kid you by passing for colored   the negro writers are appropriately left at the curb throughout the story they have remained superciliously on the edge of the harlem stage that caught the imagination of white manhattan and faraway negro artists the writers snub everyone not privy to the mysteries of gertrude stein man ray and jean toomer they ignore the works of the previous generation even james weldon johnsons they too are passing and they know it well but negro soul as visible in the facts anecdotes and subtleties of passing is not revealedto any depth inaccessible to overt wit closely reading passing in the ways of white folks one sees much irony and anguish in this old american custom hughes finds comedy on harlems sophisticated sugar hill patron of the arts written not long before the

she pours a drink for herself instead the humor is smart with embarrassed pose bright dialogue and tables turned  hovever the story reveals little that is distinctive of negro spirit but the story has the most beautiful humanizing touch in hughess fiction cornelias final small note asking darby to take his painting of her back to oklahoma to remember how your patron looked  transforrns her without it she would have been just another aging woman trying with cosmeticswardrobe cash and someone elsesinexperience and need to soften the hand of time with it she seems thoughtful and sensitive wishing for her young man no doubt in vain a return to the innocence of his drawing board she wants him to remember her in his maturity not as an older woman who lied about her age to be with him but as mrs oldham his patron who had some respect for art the works discussed in this chapter suggest the magnitude of the young hughess vision of his task as a writer they indicate the versatility of his spiral approaches to the negro soul life and love inside and outside the veil of color become subjects as wide as the authors sympathies yet as specific as artistic integrity alone can make them in every division and subdivision of topic that marks the boundaries chosen the author has produced work worthy of either admiration or respectful study
in a tribute written soon after langstons death playwright loften mitchell touched on a part of the poet which i believe deserves particular emphasis it was his refusal to play the role of top negro or the literary house nigger he grew up in an age when the greatest accolade for a black man was to be the first negro this or that having won the mantle you were supposed to guard it zealously against any threat posed by other negroes working in the field you didnt actually hire someone to go out and shoot him down or crack a few ribs but in each prof ession there were appropriate techniques employed to keep the next soul brother down at a safe distance langston who had risen by long hard years of steady production knew how poverty­stricken we were and how desperately we needed to fill the vacancies at the top and all along the line by everybody who had the talent to get there so he spent a disproportionate amount of his working lifewhich might have been devoted to self­agrandizement helping young artists get a foot in the door i doubt if there are many black writers of my generation who did not on one occasion or the other use langston as a reference when applying for a fellowship or a foundation grant and i would suppose he holds the worlds record in writing letters in support of such applications langston even passed on assignments he might well have done himself although until recent years no black writer received more assignments than he could handle for example in the late s a prestigious national magazine asked him for an article on the numbers game in harlem not long before i had published my first novel which had to do with the numbers so langston said he was too busy and put my name forward as the expert he could have dashed off a better and more inforned piece in  minutes but he knew i needed the money and the exposure there are many writers who had the same experience langston would not mind my saying that he was not the best critic in the world he felt such a deep commitment to the cause of black people everywhere that he found it terribly difficult to draw his literary razor against another brother he wanted us to get ourselves together i have lived several years in the africa he loved so much and i know that it now lies prostrate and despite all the trappings of national sovereignty and independence is being subjected to merciless rape by the white world largely because it has not got itself together in the arab­israeli conflict as these words are written in june  we have just witnessed a dramatic and tragic demonstration of what happens when one people are united and another are not here at home those of us who have managed to get before the public spend so much time tearing each other apart that it is refreshing to think of the splendid example our poet set all the days of his life he knew that the longer we kept at each others throats our real enemies would have nothing to worry about getting ourselves together this is one of the many lessons we should learn from the life and work of langston hughes
on this page in the february  issue of negro digest and on another page in the march issue of this magazine we called the attention of black writers to the fact that the national foundation on the arts and the humanities had granted  for the publication of the first american literary antho logy  the editor of this anthology george plimpton was delegated to select from the little literary magazines the works fiction poetry criticism essays which he deemed worthy of republication in the anthology each prose writer will receive  and each poet will receive  it is a way of course of rewarding talented writers whose work has not yet been recognized by the big slick magazines and the major foundations we warned black writers that since few of them are ever represented in the little magazines they would be effectively boycotted by the new anthologies we suggested that black writers who feel their work worthy of publication in such a government­subsidized anthology write to the national foundation on the arts and the humanities and voice their objection to the method of selection of material for the anthologies at the same time we wrote to the director of literary programs for the national foundation on the arts and the humanities and inf ormed her that we considered the proposed anthologies discriminatory in their conception we pointed out that unless such magazines as liberator freedomways soulbook and black dialogue also were considered as sources for material for the anthologies black writers would be ex­ cluded from participation in the program yes under the circum­ stances we also listed negro digest as an important source for ma­ terial to be considered for the anthologies a few black writers did take the time to write to the national foun­ dation on the arts and the humanities to protest what would be inevitably the exclusion of black writers from a government­subsidized project the response in washington however amounted to a sneer since the complaints were so few and so feeble there was no need to take them seriously well apparently the selections have been made for the first anthol­ ogy which will be published by farrar straus and giroux early in  and there has been no confrontation petween the black writers and the people responsible for the anthology needless to say complaints are useless after the anthology has been published and now negro digest learns that  has been granted for publication of the second american literary anthology with the same fr plimpton designated as editor so black writers have a second opportunity to voice their obje ctions to the eff ectivc exclusion of black writers from this government­sub dized project will the black writers remain silent or will they speak up in chorus the address of the national foundation on the arts and the humanities is  g street nw washington dc  mrs carolyn kizeris director of literary programs we repeat the officials involved in the publishing project insist that there is no deliberate discrimination against black writers and tech­ nically this is true however none of the magazines classified as little are published by black people and black writers with the exception of ralph ellison james baldwin and occasionally saunders redding are rarely represented in the pages of the little magazines since this is a fact which can be proven it is our belief that the pub­ lishers of the government­subsidized anthologies have the obligation to seek out the work of black writers and to give that work equal consideration with the work of writers white represented in the little magazines

oem counter poen is a tiny green jewel­like booklet of  lovely poems by dudley randall and margaret danner the idea of counterpoem means only that each respective page of poetry by mr randall is opposite a page of poetry by miss danner and that they sometimes reflect similar moods ideas and images as shown in the poems george and the patriarch and in the two belle isle poems all of the  poems were carefully chosen which seems a very much more honest way to publish than that of choosing many poems of which only several are considered of merit afewofthe poems were quite well known before poem counterpoem was published among them are  ballad of birmingham  booker t and web  by dudley randall and ill walk the tightrope and goodbye david tamunoemi west by margaret danner miss danners lovely poem a sparrow is a bird and mr randalls souvenirs and the southern road are beautiful poems which seem to reveal a lot about poetic craftsmanship and which as such southern road seems to have all the rich scorching loamy black vitality of the delta and the black belt and of miss danners variegated africa these following lines are from lr randalls poem the southern road to a land where shadowed songs like flowersswell and where the earth is scarier as a scar friezed by the bleeding lash that fell  fell upon my fathers flesh  f arfar f ar and deep my blood has drenched it none can bar my birthright to the loveliness bestowed upon this country haughty as a star and i set forth upon the south ern road most important of all f actors is that this book was publ ished by broadside press that is sign ificant for poets who are concerned aboutperhaps black_power also it is an off ering by two better know n black poets poem counterpoem sellsfor  this does seem rather over­priced are   nsp  r  ng when one considers the fact that mr randalls sonorous lines in the southern road are rich in melody and in imagery and in idea it could be described as a protest poem if there were any such thing it has a great deal of power pain and despair the repetition of the line and i set forth upon the  poetry is the orphan of the arts nevertheless for those who wish to read a lovely non­commercial looking carefully made book of poetry poe counter poem can be ordered from  broadside press   old mill place detroit fichigan  the title of the late langston hughes anthology the best short stories by n egro writers little brown  implies a high degree of excellence that is if these are the best short stories by negro writers every one should be of extraordinary merit some of these have this quality others do not those that to me are outstanding in this collection are jean toomers fern  zora neale hurstons the gilded six­bits  cyrus colters the beach umbrella  ralph ellisons flying home  yerbys health card  gwendolyn brooks were the only colored people here  james baldwins this morning this evening so soon  mary elizabeth vromanssee how they run  john a williams son in the afternoon  william melvin kelleys the only man on liberty street  woodie kings beautif ul light and black our dreams  lebert bethunes the burglar  and ronald milners junkie joe had some money these are outstanding because to me they deeply engaged the reader either through characterization incident or situation and even after reading they were not forgotten like froth that appears in a womans magazine but continued to reverberate in the memory their style was good and did not irritate through clumsiness flatness or imprecision jean toomer and woodie king were poetic and suggestive james baldwin was elegant and eloquent mary vroman was almost too sweet but the emotion came through gwendolyn brooks was sensitive and perceptive frank yerbys story was extremely powerf ul you forgot you were reading words you were there it would be a stand­out in any collection ralph ellisons situation was strong despite straining after symbolism william kelley had a bare simplicity lebert bethunes story was almost too slick but it had a sus­ penseful f oreboding and it persisted in the memory ronald milners story had the loose rambling quality of some of the other childhood reminiscences but the nervous jagged style fits the situation of a child who stumbled upon a murder and the murderers and who all summer long ran here and ran there kn owing the murd erers were watching him incidentally this story junkie joe  is not published here for the first time as stated in the acknowledgements it appeared years ago in a short­lived magazine published by the henry brothers of michigan this is not to imply that the other stories were not good some however were clumsy in style some were slight and lacking in density of substance while others though strong in spots were not compelling all the way through others were simply forgotten after reading perhaps it is best to regard the collection as one showing the scope and variety of stories by negro authors all the stories are not on the race problem as one might assume some like arna bontemps a summer tragedy  paule marshalls barba­ dos  and alice walkers to hell with dying treat the themes of living loving and dying others like ernest gaines interesting treatment of folkways a long day in november  conrad rivers mother to son  and rudolph fishers miss cynthe  reveal family relationships ronald fairs lusty miss luhester gives a party pearl craytons rollicking the day the world almost came to an end and alice childress biting the pocketbook game are humorous but kristin hunters an interesting social study charles wrights a new day and charlie russells quietus do depict racial relations and confrontations langston hughes has assembled in this book a plentiful assortment of short stories showing a wide range in theme treatment and quality­

one of the first impressions you get after reading american n egro short stories hill and wang soft cover  is that this anthology edited by john henrik clarke is really in keeping with the times what better time to bring to the fore a collection of short stories by black writers the political and social ferment of our times has created an unprecedented quest by black people for a true ac­ counting of their past if clarkes book did nothing else but contribute to that search by identif ying black storytellers and their works it would have achieved a measure of success however this anthology does that and more in the introduction  clarke alludes to another achievement un­ til recently the contribution of negro writers to the development of the american short story has been sadly neglected true indeed  the contributions of negroes to all fields of  art and literature have been pathet­ ically neglected filling the informational gap in the short story field could be regarded as the books greatest success clarke brings together the stories of  writers some like langston hughes w e b du bois and richard wright are established by whatever criteria you choose others are not the selections cover several literary periods two th century masters of the short story paul laurence dunbar and charles chestnutt are blended perfectly with authors of the negro renaissance and moderns like james baldwin and leroi jones equally important their works encompass various themes which scale the full range of emotions felt by black people in several centuries of racism in limiting each writer to one selection the anthology leaves itself open to criticism by reducing the giants to the level of the ordinary perhaps a broad survey that successfully lists the contributions of negro writers to the development of the american short story has to reach out and give equal space to the great the good and the ordinary more depth should be allowed though to men like chestnutt hughes and wright the major influences for lesser known writers in short the teacher deserves more space than the pupil still the book is thoroughly enjoyable dunbars the lynching of jube benson is an engrossing and tragic story of a simple and kind negro jube benson who is lynched for a murder he didnt commit be­ sides its realism the accourt is done in conventional language proving that dunbar could portray white characters with as much feeling subtlety and depth as he could negro folk characters in his more famed dialect poetry instead it is chestnutt often overlooked as a master dialecti­ cian whose the goophered grape­ vine is written in that medium though best known as a historian and social critic du bois is at his witty sharply satirical best in on being crazy  a neatly woven tale of an unnamed character who confounds his racist detractors with teasing rationalizations in all aerican n egro short stories affords the reader both good entertainment and insight into the feelings of black people from some of the most qualified observers
in november  trident press published a first novel by a ­yearold los angeles girl named jane phillips the novel m oj o hand went almost unnoticed which is not strange for there are dozens of unremarkable novels published every season but what was strange was the novel itself a brief uneven apparently biographical tale of an attrac­ tive young peola possessed with an adoration for a blues­singing guitar­ plucking black man a couple of worlds away from her california upbringing the almost plotless story is all but unimaginable in real life  a girl still in her teens travels from los angeles across country to raleigh in search of a man whose music she has heard and loved her luggage includes a guitar which she plays herself when she gets blue and she gets blue often she finds the man in a routinely poverty­stricken area of raleigh and moves in with him taking a job as waitress at peon wages in a rundown combination restaurant­whore house everyth ing she has which the musi­ cian will take she gives him including her puny wages it is assumed that she cannot tear herself away from the man and his bed even when he boots her about like so much rubbage he is a god to her when he takes the instrument in his gnarled black fingers and croons in his plaintive voice all manner of her suffering is justified 
the girl called eunice moves like a somnambulist yielding unlovingly and unrespondingly to men who take herback in califomia she had lived in a middle­class milieu but on her mystical journey she adjusts to a primitive life with no problem at all she demands nothing all that is important is that the man known as blacksnake is near her that the creator of the music she needs to hear is however tenuously attached to her there is no evidence that she loves him only that his being alive pro­ vides reason for her own efforts at survival she does not question she merely is much of the strangenessof mojo hand unquestionably lies in the authorsfailure oftechniquethere is never for exampleany explanation for eunices rejection of everything to seekout blacksnake andthere is no effort to justifya lovely young girls overwhelmingattraction for a physically unappealing and personally unadmirablefolksingerof apparently run­of­the­mill ability how­ ever absenceoftechnique does not alone account for the almost­weird quality of the novel eunice comes alive in the book but she alsocomes through as a fearfullypatheticcreature a child­woman already stripped of emotionand devoidof either ambition or a sense of values she wears her life like a looseuntidy garment however janephillips makes up with soulfor whatever she lacks in novelistic technique and development the down­at­the­heelsquality of the towns inwhich her characters move isevoked with thebarestde­ scription and the words and the be­ havior of her characters never waver fromthemarkthe world in which euniceseeks out herdrab destiny is flat and cold and rarely touchedby hope sex is easy and liquor runs free and violence lurks and yel  there is everywhere a basic sort of kindness and freedom a willingness to confront life as it is a wisdom born of knowing the measure of man and where inevitably man ends toward the middle of the novel eunice tires of blacksnakes abuse of her and packs her battered bag she journeys as far as lake charles before changing her mind and starting back in search of him in lake charles she goes to bed with a gi on leave but does not respond to him the soldier insists on following her back to raleigh and on to south bay where blacksnake has gone to live with another woman she moves in with the estranged wife of blacksnakes buddy now she is heavy with blacksnakes child there waiting she becomes a part of the dockside society of whores stevedores and villagers she finally chases away the soldier who loves her in the end eunice abandons south bay but she does not return to her home and family in california  she makes her way back to the crumbling cabin where blacksnakes ancient mother lives alone the old woman accepts the pregnant girl and the books action is over that in any case is a kind of affirmation a decision whatever its meaning but the strangeness of the novel remains the symbolism haunts confusing and indistinct the emphasis on folk music inexpertly done seems in retrospect to have been gratuitous and while eunices choice is baffling it has a logic which grows out of her inexplicable obsession perhaps after all that is enough still jane phillips has produced a work just disturbing enough just provocative enough to make the reader curious as to whether here is an unusual new talent at hand or whether just possibly it all was a kind of desperate catharsis­ hwf
then ilast saw langston hughes he was r off again on one of ­­­ge those endless odysseys up to our expectations of what a poet should be even in that segregated school our models for literature and success were white  and we were led to believe that a poet could only be white tall with blue eyes and a shock of long black wavy hair we read emerson  bryant wordsworth and coleridge and modeled our images of what a poet should be like upon the patterns presented to us by our teachers no place had been set aside in our world for a hughes and ­  to read his poetry and though we were amused and ento make a little of that money which people always assumed erroneously that he had i first met him on such an odyssey he had traveled to our high school in virginia read his poetry and chatted with students and teachers though to my knowledge none of us had ever met a real live poet beforehughesin no way measured couraged by him still we felt somehow betrayed f or a negro poet was as alien to our comprehension as a negro president yet he stayed with us for a short time laughing talking and assuring and then he was gone and we went back to emerson bryant wordsworth and coleridge he was the only negro poet who ever came to us and though none of us realized it at that time he destroyed something fundamental within us despite what our teachers told us emerson bryant  wordsworth and coleridge would never again have the same eff ect upon us for though ve had excluded hughes from our minds shut him out like some oedipus still that distorted image of what constituted a literary figure was tarnished  if not com pletely negated some time after his visit many of us turned to negro literature for the first time to poems by mckay hughes johnson and dunbar to novels by wright redding himes and fauset at each point of awareness we became a little more embittered by the assumption that our elders had made about us of our eagerness to accept their models withou t benefit of a personal choice we became even more disheartened because there was a world of ours which was so alien to us which had been carefully hidden from us by those who should have been instrumental in revealing it to us in that world were people who shared so many of our own experiences hopes and desires and yes our own anguish and pain the rivers of which langston hughes sang were more real to us than those of limpid blue crystalline streams which flow through so much of english and american poetry the yearning for das fl ie gende stunde  the fleeting hour of fulfillment in a world which promised nothing but chaos confusion and death that yearning so peculiar to the literature of the western world was for us most profoundly expressed in hughes johnson  and mckay and no poet neither a bryant nor an arnold would ever vouchsafe lines to us which portrayed our feelings of pessimism despair and fear so well as those of langston hughes we cry among the skyscrapers as our ancestors cried among the palms in africa because we are alone it is night and were afraid four months ago at a party given by a mutual friend i attempted to impart some of this to hughes beaming as usual a bright smile lighting up his tired face he listened half­heartedly and jokingly emitted some words of thanks perhaps i did not completely get through to him it is difficult to pra ise a man to his face without becoming sentimental but moreover it is difficult to tell a writer that his writing not only made you think not only inspired you not only encouraged you but in addition gave you that strong silent strength which only words can give to one who must face a stronger and noisier world and again it is difficult to tell any human being that his words made visible to you a new universe aglow with promise and hope but perhaps he would not have believed me for years critics had said that he was a simple poet a folk singer a mere teller of tales lacking inprofundity and complexity the message he carried the songs he sang devoid of pathos energy meaning and direction he was a negro poet who could not get beyond hisnegritude and thus they said he could never journey to the universal paradise where the aspirations of men soar far beyond race creed and color like richard wright hughes too was a negro writer and like wright he never denied it therefore readers black and white allowed his books to gather dust on bookshelves to lie untouched upon library shelves across the country from his writings from his public lectures from his private conversations that enthusiasm that love for the people so dostoyevskian in its intensity pervaded everything that he said and for this reason he was like wright an alien a lonely man invisible in the literature of that country which he loved so well and of which he sang so eloquently his was the fate of the negro writer people who knew him by name managed to get his autograph never read his poetry critics who read his writings did not understand it and therefore dismissed it as worthless high school teachers who rushed to any gathering to come into contact with him never taught his poetry to their students middle class negroes who loved to have him a great conversationalist as an invited guest at their suburban affairs never read his poetry aloud to their children  the colleges of this country  their english departments in particular which have exalted robert burns dismissed hughes completely uttering their synony m for negro writerssimple he has remained alive in literature not because people read what he wrote few have but because of his frequent excursions into towns and hamlets bringing with him  in his own humble way the message of a people and yet these tireless excursions these endless odysseys robbed him of that vitality that youth which may have enabled him to last a few years more when i said goodby to him for the last time he was on his way to the university of california a university whose english department would never include a poem of his in its syllabus for american literature to lecture and to read his poetry he was already an old man and the age showed even beneath the spontaneous laughter and youthful joy which attempted to buttress it at a time when white poets and writers of his stature had retired to their estates become seers and honored prophets of literature he was embarking upon yet another odyssey because at sixty­five he did not have the not even those he sang so long and so passion ately had rewarded him for all of his long years his endless devotion the negro  wrote richard wright is americasmetaphor and langston hughes is the metaphor for the negro writer far more than his poetry his novels his plays and his countless lectures his treatment by the academic establishment is the best example of what it means to be a negro writer in america  and in many ways he was more fortunate than most for his name among those of my generation if not a household word  is known and respected  yet like other rewards posterity will more than likely escape him those footprints which he etched upon the sands of time viii be wiped away no trace left of their imprint barring a mad dash for his books now that he is dead a dash which might have helped to keep him alive in but a short span of time even his name like that of cullen toomer and locke will be unknown to any but those who prepare dissertations negro renaissance the high schools and colleges which denied him in life will continue unless something radical happens to americas educational  system to deny him in death and thereby to doom him to extinction f or unfortunately literary figures are kept alive in our high schools colleges and universities another generation of negro youngsters there£ore will not be as fortunate as those of my generation will have no choice but bryant emerson wordsworth and coleridge this is the tragedy of america and it isthis which causesthe pain the anguish and the despair voiced by the negro intellectual in the cry for black_power we are denied our own heroes our own prophets our own songsters because of a group of narrow­minded insecure little men have determined a priori that such songsters prophets and heroes are not good enough in english departments across this nation both black and white the shroud is wrapped securely around the corpse of the negro writer perhaps they are right perhaps as they argue langston hughes was not a great poet perhaps he carried no message of profundity perhaps his was a simple world unlike and this will come as a surprise to many critics that world of jesse b semple perhapsand yet these are observations which no small group of men should be allowed to make arbitrarily value judgments which should at best be made in concert with those who will be the beneficiaries of the judgment instead critics black and white dismiss the negro writer hand down arbitrary judgments concerning himin the same fashion in which hugheshas been arbitrarily dismissed on the college campuses of america hughes was a negro poet and theref ore inconsequential he was a poet of his people and despite robert bumsjohn millington synge and william butler yeats a poet should not be a poet of a particulargroup of people but of all the people he wrote of drunken negroes of sad negroes of happy negroesof confused negroes in the same veinin whichjohngay wrote of englishmen with similar characteristics yethughes but notgaywasac­ cused of writing oftrivial things like wordsworth and bums hughes language was meant to be the languageof the people yet unlike his mainstream prdecessorshis verse was labeledsimple yet most negroes know that his verse was not simple neither was hislife he lived the role of the greatesttragedian on any stageand throughout his writing forthe life that he lived that life of joy sometimes and sorrowsometimesisthe life that mostnegroes live few can give voice to their anguish and despair as hughes wasable to do none can so adequately justify the ways of negroes to the world as hughesdoes so well in all of his writings none can keep him safe for posterity for negroes are powerlessto do so against the army of academicians who wait like vultures to dismember his corpse still further his reputation as the poet of the people cannot be kept alive in a world which seeks as we rush faster toward the armageddon of integration to negate the people all that one can do is to remember that there once lived a writer proud to be a negro writ­ er  who never disowned either his heritage or his people a poet who came before us lived amongus and died this is no doubta sim­ ple commentary upon the life of so beloved and sogenerous a man and yet a commentary undeserving of many of todays writers who have f ound a haven among the english departments in our best universities because asthey point out so vociferously they are not negro writers but american writers 
in school a fellow english major asked  me to read aloud for   poems of langston h ughessilce i had acted in a numbr of campus plays late into the night with what turned into a whole room full of students we read and read over again the poems of mr hughes one favorite verse being lulu said to leonard i want a diamond ring leonard said to lulu you wont get a goddam thing this one we felt to be daring enough a shock of defiance for the staid presbyterian walls of knoxville college the next day lulu and leonard were dorrnitory characters it was later and through dr rosey e pool that i happened to meet mr hughes after her  visit to the campus she suggested that i write to him and send along some poetry i did and received a reply which was an inspiration far greater than lulu and leonard laterinnew york ifinally met him he was more earthy and warm than ever i could have imagined the occasion was a party to celebrate his acceptance of the spingam award after such a meeting how could anyone re member langston hughes in any manner other than one of gratitude love and warm respect for his gentle person his humor and quality of the completely genuine istillremember his coming over to me and asking what are you having to drink having come recently from the black belt and being in complete awe of s i n i said coca cola he looked at me in his smiling manner and replied a writer cant make it on coca cola it was spoken with the impact of humor i grew to know in him but i could feel the seriousness imbedded within his statement during the party iexpressedmy wish to become an actress a famous actress spoke of the marvels of the stage and said it was a splendid idea and that i should really consider it that writers should be and often were capable dramatists i was thrilled later aswe made our way toward a theatre to hear another writer read from his latest i was enthralled with the idea wouldnt myformer drama director be glad to know his faith inme would be confirmedwouldnthebeproud quietly so that only i could hear theformerlyradiant actress said in an agonized voice forget t its a dogs life follow a professionwhere youllbe able toeat stunned i later asked mr hughes why the lady had added this spirit­dampening bit of news dont think hard of her  he said she was on an actress is always on every group is her audience every audience is her public she was on what the hell was on he was always most patient with me when people refer to him as a great poet they should add to that great human being  for he was the greatest in my keeping are books and cards at many seasons and occasions from mr hughes he never forgot me not as a poet not as a person he respected the efforts of younger poets last october i heard him read at the guggenheim museum two weeks later in the hospital his flowers and cards arrived at christmas and new years other cards arrived from langston hughes whose love for life and for people will be remembered and cherished by many for there are others who can no doubt recall as lovely memories near his door at th street he grew ivy someone did it was the only flowering on the whole street and now i think who will grow the ivy or see that it is there he continued to help the younger poets even through the political discrediting and over the so­called gulf of generations he was a fine man a beautiful brilliant and loving man was langston hughes we younger poets are in tum the budding new green of his ivy
it is an unfortunate commentary indeed that so many times we fail to realize comprehend the true value breadth scope influence of a person only until after that person has gone from us irrevocably i par­ tially must admit some guilt in this respect in relation to langston after his passing it fell upon me like a ton of bricks that even though i had known him called him friend that actually i knew little of him about him i had once owned the big sea but had not read it before it got away from me as books do after his passing i borrowed a copy of his second biographi­ cal volume i wonder as i wander and took it and the langston h ughes reader along with me on a short trip both i read from cover to cover and thus became re­acquainted with known facts of langstons life and delighted with the discovery of little known facts had i read previously about his travels my own might have been richer and deeper the fine sensitive creative human being that langston was was brought home to me sampling the read er i savored his poems prose blues plays essays and speeches what depth what versatility what sin­ cerity what a rare creative soul was langston surely a model superb for all of us who endeavor to create to emulate i first had the honor of meeting langston in the early thirties when we of the negro peoples theatre put on his dont you want to be free at abraham lincoln center he came to smile at and encourage us fledgling thespians then  years later with a similar company some of us appeared in his the sun do m ove at parkway house on fifty first street i understudied the role of a strong black woman who stood behind her man against oppression langston saw me play the role and said he thought it was quite good like he had written it of course that endeared him to me however i grew closer to him through my reading of his poems such as ive known rivers  the negro mother  i too sing america  let america be america again  and many others which were watchwords for the protest movement of the time in retrospect i find that i am have been most impressed with langstons unselfishness and the con­ sistent encouragement that he gave to all who endeavored to create to langston it was come on in the waters fine  come let me help you theres plenty of room up here  tell me what i can do to help you this and much more langston re­ sponded to our efforts to start an african american museum in the midwest in a real way by sending money artif acts books programs clippings and a rare item his christening robe and cap finally the man the poet james mercer langston hughes will always be loved and remembered by the plain people black and white for he spoke their our language yes he always leveled with us and we certainly did dig him langston hughes lives
