what might herald an w awakening seems now to be in progress among the influential molders of public opinion in the united states of america it is taking place as a reaction to the angry violent and widespread outbursts of afroamericans which led to the serious casualties in several important cities notably newark and detroit such is the conclusion reasonably to be inferred from a survey of the editorial page of the new york times of sunday july   this journal be it noted is the most conservative and powerful daily paper published in the usa the leading editorial of the times seeks to assess the responsibility white and black it begins by observing that the powerful forces of this revolt are unprecedented there follows immediately the extraordinary quotation of that penetrating analysis of the world situation made at the opening of this century by the farseeing dean of afroamerican letters william edward burghardt dubois the very man who was condemned as a radical and arrested and humiliated as such at the behest of the power structure now the opening paragraph of this editorial in the new york times quotes as follows the words of the noted negro scholar dr w e b dubois were prophetic when he wrote decades ago the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color linethe relation of the darker to the lighter races of man     this editorial then goes on to make the following significant acknowledgement and admission white americans of course must share the greater burden of responsibility the attempt is also made to spell out this responsibility in briefto help achieve full equality by certain concrete measures it is further recognized that negro americans too have their responsibilities which must be met if this confrontation crisis is to be overcome these responsibilities are seen by the new york times in terms of faith in the promise of america and the assurance blandly offered after some  years  years if the colonial period be included that its democratic institutions and democratic ethic must be seen as the high road that no basic change of policy is yet intended is apparent in the lapse into a tirade against paranoid rabble rousers and specifically against the h rap browns this is followed by a demand upon the negro community to make them powerless but no matter how afroamericans may disagree with some of the more impulsive utterances of young spokesmen like h rap brown it is certain generally that they will not respond to a summons to render up such youth leaders as sacrificial lambs still more significant however are certain statements made by new york times columnist c l sulzberger in foreign affairs the fractured giant pointing to divisions ripping apart the american structure this writer moves directly to the recognition race is not only our most important national issue but also our most important international issue pointing further to the nonwhite world majority this correspondent concludes we cannot forever entertain wholesome peaceful relationships abroad unless we compose our own racial disputes this analyst then probes for the cause and finds no logical explanation of racism or even an acceptable definition of race on which anthropologists can agree looking back into history for the origin of racism c l sulzberger arrives at the basic and revealing facts as follows until the fifteenth century europefrom which our ancestors cameknew no such prejudices it developed only as exploration opened foreign lands inhabited by sources of labor that could easily be enslaved here it should be observed that this is the same basic historical analysis which has been set forth and documented in the book the name negro its origin and evil use the commentator sulzberger continued with the following significant observation this cynical factor was most efficiently exploited in africa our second great continent of origin and because we blandly ignored the constitution and the bill of rights for decades ignoring the claim of afroamericans to be free as euroamericans and even today disputing their claim to be equal we are at last paying the bill it is enlightening to note how by delving into history to find the origin of race in the development of the modern slave system this analyst and commentator was thus brought directly to the continental origins of the two major groups of the population of the u s a through his understanding of prior history culture and lands of origin and also because of his emphasis on freedom this writer is thereby led logically easily and naturally to use the appropriate terms and names to designate these two great groups of citizens of the u s a namely afroamericans and euroamericans here indeed is a cardinal lesson and it is to be hoped a signficant beginning of the removal of prejudice from american habits of thought speech daily practice and customary attitude in a third article on this same editorial page of the new york times the two faces of the negro revolution william v shannon attempts to assess the present violence and unrest among afroamericans in the light of similar great upheavals elsewhere  having not yet attained to the historical understanding of the background as arrived at by sulzberger shannon continues to use though perhaps unconsciously the racist slave designation negroes nevertheless a step forward is taken toward the recognition of americans of african descent as human by considering these present eruptions of afroamericans as in some respects like the natives in a europeanruled colony or the submerged workers in paris and st petersburg before the french and russian revolutions but no mention is made of the haitian revolution of  or of its signal role in the abolition of chattal slavery and later in the liberation of latin america through the decisive aid rendered to general bolivar by president petion of haiti nor does mr shannon recall the uprisings throughout the caribbean during  in barbados alone the toll was  killed  wounded and  jailed these socalled disturbances signalled a turning point from colonialist subjugation towards advancement and independence specifically comparing the present situation with events in algeria in the late s and in ireland in  william v shannon notes the conflict arising between leaders liberal and middle class in their outlook and the radicals who challenged and supplemented them the new radicals shannon concludes the stokely carmichaels and the h rap browns are challenging the older middle class negro leaders on quite different grounds for them the analogy of the negro revolution is    with the nationalist revolutions of independence correctly and cogently shannon observes yet mere economic gains will not relieve the anger resentment and damaged selfrespect of people who feel separated from their fellow americans not only by economic inequality but also by the color of their skin while we agree with this writer that neither harlem nor newark nor mississippi is likely to become an independent negro republic we are nevertheless certain that the solution is not to be found simply or solely in negro owned    street corner businesses and the houses in which negroes take community pride far more fundamental changes in the whole structure of american society and in its mores customs and attitudes will have to be achieved in order to bring about peaceful and viable relations not only must full economic opportunity be achieved in business and in executive positions and in labor especially in the higher crafts and the skills of tomorrow but also political voting administration and power as well as cultural recognition and the frank accordance of human dignityall are essential to a genuine solution as the great afroamerican leader frederick douglass declared long ago in his reply to president andrew johnson at the outset of the reconstruction period after the civil war peace between races is not to be secured by degrading one race and exalting another by giving power to one race and withholding it from another but by maintaining a state of equal justice between all races first pure then peaceable
it is pedestrian enough a beginning to say that i was a college senior myself seventeen years ago    though still relatively young i feel that the years of my public life fit me to say something relevant to the college graduates of today    in retrospect  of those years have been spent in the pastoral and preaching ministry the remainder have been almost equally divided between being a revolutionary and being a part of the establishment when i think back to  at the time when i was a college graduate what i would have wanted most was for someone to tell me the truth about the kind of world that awaited me speeches addresses and some sermons are a dime a dozen but the presentation of truth is awesome to speak it requires courage to write the truth is very often dangerous to live it guarantees an early death cf one galilean named jesus  for the sake of brevity suffice it to say that there are some things about the society you are about to enter that ought to be verbalized just in case you havent found out already there are three points that i submit for your close scrutiny the first has to do with a crime the second has to do with vietnam and the third has to do with god crime we must face the harsh reality that the endproduct of our american system is a racist society based on color prejudice most of the process takes place by calculated design accommodation to the racist result is largely involuntary to be specific the crime i mentioned above is the crime of the western historians who have carefully written the black man out of the chronicles of the past the psychosis of racial supremacy requires removaldestruction of the objectionable kindand so by historical genocide the black men in world and western civilization were done in by men who knew better but accommodated themselves and their tasks to city hall the crown the ku klux klan whatever that is the crime rob a people of their sense of history and you take away their hope but it is not alone a crime against black men it is also a crime against all other men the absence of truth in history made them become involuntary race supremacists during the most critical and formative years of childs development the days of public and private school lifethe learning materials used the history texts the social studies books are  and  per cent white the domination of white over black that began in this hemisphere with the slave trade has been perpetually and persistently reenforced in the total learning process of the individual and the group in america honesty impels me to confess that we black people have been mentioned however in those sparse instances where black life was noticed the distortions are almost unbearable when compared to the truth how can i explain to my three sons and daughter that frederick douglass is a far more attractive hero than booker t washington when there is no record of a frederick douglass in most public school history texts is it no wonder that white children are poisoned with racism and prejudice as soon as they learn their abcs as far as the record discloses black people began as slaves small wonder that negroes repress any thought or notion of their slave ancestry for the books not only disclose it as a fact but strongly infers that we didnt resist slavery white america has never had a chance to understand and comprehend the horroryes the horror of slavery in america i request equal time and attention for our slave experience given the  jews who were exterminated under hitler what would an accurate chronicle of the foregoing reveal how interesting that absolutely authentic and documented sources detail highly developed ancient subsahara nations which paralleled the nations of the dark ages in europe that means that while anglos and saxons were living in caves in the forests and using stone axes to find something to eat in the heart of africa there were kings and princes and exporters and importers great schools of learning precise systems of currency and what must be considered for that age advanced technology that included the weaving of cloth and the smelting of brass and iron yes we were slaves but before that we were kings and queens and men of commerce and industry we never did like slavery and our masters knew it before  there were more than  slave revolts how is it that i never knew of nat turner and denmark vesey until i became a student at virginia union i repeat that the endproduct of our american system as it is now constructed is a racist society white and black alike the brainwashing affected us too i recall vividly now that after reading seventhgrade geography my impressions of slavery were not very bad but i dare you to review the autobiography of frederick douglass and to read the description of the cruel disposition of peoplefathers mothers sons and daughterson the occasion of an estate being settled after a certain slave owners death this is a small indication of why the churchrelated and independent colleges must be preserved it is to virginia unions honor and glory that the study of negro heritage is required to say that the endproduct of our american system is a racist society is a severe indictment but it also is accurate and sound it is sound or why else has america been unable to respond to the increasingly incessant demand for unqualified equal opportunity by the black community much of the hysteria that surrounds black_power is directly traceable to the nations guilt during the last dozen years after the most frenetic activity in the race relations arena in the wake of thousands of jailings hundreds of thousands of dollars expended and millions of ergs of energy invested the black community finds itself in worse condition now than it was in  whereas the use of black_power as a slogan is tatically unsound the larger community must understand the legitimacy of this cry of despair and frustration when you draw the bottom line we are further behind than we were when the supreme court ruled favorably in the historic brown vs board  of education case in  what is the nations excuse can you be convinced that we do not have the material resources or the creative programs or the knowhow we do not have the will it is the perennial lowpriority given to the concerns of the black community in america that has spawned the black_power spectrum america cannot blame stokely carmichael america needs to blame america let me suggest a for instance we have had a major and specific voting rights bill  years overdue the department of justice has notcannot will notprovide sufficient federal registrars to guarantee the unhampered right to vote all over the south the alleged problem manpower yet in the santo domingo crisis some months ago within  hours america put  marines ashore it is a clear matter of priority the bare reality is that america does not yet have the moral maturity to deal totally with the dilemma of race until america is able to digest the concept of intermarriage there will not be any lasting and significant breakthrough in race relations to narrow the province of my selection of a partner in marriage to my own kind is to deny my basic humanity if you do not accept me first as a human being then you do not give a tinkers dam as to what kind of job opportunity i have where i live and what kind of education my children secure the die is cast america either we must be provided unqualified equal opportunity or we must be exterminated vietnam the present dilemma in southeast asia and our hysterical response to dissent on the conduct of the war has overtones of this same racism first the fine hand of racism betrays itself in the bitter denunciation of dr martin_luther_king jr i say without reservation that martin_luther_king is the most marvelous human being i have ever encountered this may seem like an overstatement but you see i havent met everybody i need file no brief for dr_kings historical importance time will take care of that im sure he is without peer in the social revolution he is an able and gifted preacher he is a possible throwback to the orators of several generations ago he has had some considerable influence on the theological thinking of our day he was in fact the nobel honoree for peace in  this is the man who has been vilified most for taking a position against the war in vietnam consider for a moment that all of the credentials catalogued above are negated because of the circumstances of color who is the adversary in this circumstance there is no need to list the far right the segregationists etc some are former white liberals they presume wrongly that breaking with martin_luther_king leaves their liberality intact they recount their unstinting support of civil_rights and they add but dr_king lost me at the u n they decry the mixing of civil_rights and the peace movement as if to sayand some dothat martin_luther_king is either unqualified to speak on matters of foreign policy or his arena is civil_rights and he ought to stay in his place then there are some former black liberals who presume that they too are qualified i guess by their blackness to denounce dr_king for dragging civil_rights into the peace movement the norfolk journal and guide one of the best papers we have editorialized in this tone the grim portent of hurting the civil_rights movement is underscored without much attention given to rightness or wrongness of dr_kings position in the same vein one of our new york papers headlined a release from the freedom foundation based in valley forge pa i believe thusly responsible negro leadership denounces kings peace stand as i read the article and saw the names of the negroes involved there was no guessing who they were they were the same negroes who a few months and years ago we had to drag literally drag kicking and screaming through the sitins the freedom rides the march on washington and the selma to montgomery march these were the responsible negro leaders who denounced dr_king remember we dragged them kicking and screaming    you can have them theyre all yours    in the second place somewhere sight has been lost of the fact of the complete immorality of our involvement by what tortuous route did we come by our advisorship and thence to a man war when french colonialism died in southeast asia we were at the side of the french with dollars and materiel helping them to reestablish colonialism colonialism as you know is another name for slavery finally france lost her stomach for that lost cause but we wanted to continue we fought against the geneva accord of  unsuccessfully and then refused to sign it then we helped to make diem dictator and kept him dictator until he lost his usefulness to our purposes it is a fact that he was one of the most brutal and corrupt men in asia and chief betrayer of the geneva accord i ask the same question sen robert kennedy asks what are we doing in vietnam i suspect that the u s military bases which ring southeast asia are our only concern and that is selfserving and selfdefeating third there is no connection apparently between dr_kings position on vietnam and that of other outstanding leaders in national and govemment life i refer to the new york times of april  where in four different speeches by senators of different political stripe and temperament there is stated the substance of dr_kings speech at the u n senators fulbright mcgovern gruening and robert f kennedy the secretary general of the u n u thant agrees that the escalation of the war in vietnam is moving us toward world war iii dr benjamin spock has not been publicly chided to my knowledge to go back to tending babies but martin_luther_king    well i think the message is clear the sum and substance of the king position on vietnam and its connection with human rights in america is a question of the moral capacity of our nation can we respond to the demands of morality if america has no morality beyond her shores how can she be moral at home or stated conversely if america has no morality at home how can she be moral in southeast asia god that brings me to the final concern the challenge of this age is to resist and conquer in each of our own being the racist brainwashing that is still active in our midst if there is no other significance to this day it must be noted that students have had an opportunity to develop their individual potential in an aura of academic freedom and independence thats what virginia union and hampton and morehouse are all about these hallowed grounds and dear old walls reek with the sacrifice of noble saints who refused to go along with the system black and white they believed under god in the full humanity of the newly freed men and their progeny in those early days wooden buildings would have been acceptable but they insisted that the walls be of granite to depict permanence and solidity the form of education was in the classical tradition uncle remus tales would not do for reading lessons it had to be thomas paine and rousseau and latin in iambic pentameter and the greek of xenephons anabasis to be absolutely sure that our grandparents had a chance at exactly the same things the students at harvard and yale and smith received the fundamental basis of that insistence was their commitment to the hebraic christian tradition this is a wicked world but it can be made better the black colleges must survive their best chance is in the extension of black students and their lives to the world as far as we have come we have come most of the way on the strength of our preachers and teachers and doctors and lawyers many of them nameless whose baccalaureate degrees were conferred by the churchrelated and independent colleges and universities that we founded and nurtured in the hebraicchristian tradition the relevance of what i am getting at is corroborated in the lives of the alumni of these institutions it is not by chance that the chairman of the board of trustees of virginia union for example has galvanized his profession into meaningful involvement in the present social revolution dr john holloman has marched and demonstrated in the south for three summers aided by his leadership the medical profession has made wide services available where none were before but more importantly he has been a gadfly within his profession fighting racism unequivocally in the health services of the nation he has taken his fight to the congress of the united states on more than one occasion there are others too numerous to mention milton reid here in virginia walter fauntroy in the nations capital virgil wood in boston these men have committed their lives to the fundamental principles upon which black colleges were founded wherever they work and live whatever they do there is exhibited a tenacity that disclosed they know the things for which they struggle are just and right win lose or draw be under no illusion    
children have v been brainwashed into £ believing that they are  jy inferior beings it is the  general concensus that the white race is responsible for white superiority propaganda there is undoubtedly much truth to this but believe me whites have had some strong allies among negroes themselves negroes who are responsible for the training of young minds must bear a part of the blame for the insecurities among their people i imagine that as far back as the average negro can recollect he has been indoctrinated with the idea of white superiority it is easy to make the white race the scapegoat for this fallacy what few negroes realize or are willing to admit is that if negroes had a firm and secure belief in themselves it would be difficult for someone to give them an inferior image the negroes who are partly responsible for this indoctrination i label negro propagandists these solid citizens band together in social cliques which lack the characteristics of a true social circle and form what i call social knots their members are oound together by a special type of insecurity outwardly they present a picture of efficiency and unquestionable belief in themselves they place themselves above caring what the other race thinks about them they lead the type of social life they lead because that is what they want to do  they read certain books and wear certain styles of clothing because that is what they want to do they are beyond being influenced by another supposedly superior group of people at any rate that is what they want others to believe the pathetic truth of the situation is that the negro propagandist is unaware of his own subconscious beliefs in his own racial inferiortiy he has been brainwashed from his mothers knee all the way to adulthood his beliefs are deeply planted the propagandists mother worked for mrs soandso the grandeur and finery of the whitefolks world was breathtaking mrs soandsos spacious house her closets of beautiful clothes her bountifully laden dinner table all left mama flabbergasted to say the least at the end of each weary day mama filled the childrens ears with the splendor of the whitefolks world the beauty of that other world was indelibly imprinted on the minds of the young listeners their daydreams were based on the happiness and the finery they believed existed in the world of mr and mrs soandso character values and human frailties were not ingredients which were included in this world of dreams in the allnegro schools the same children who had listened at mamas knee and who had compared their lots with that of mrs soandso were further brainwashed into believing in the superiority of that other world the negro teacher whose indoctrination had also begun with mamas tales used the phrase like the white people as though it were a whip children please come to school clean and fresh tomorrow comb your hair and wear your nicest outfits the white children will be at the planetarium too listen to classical music because white children listen to classical music dont you want to be like the white children practice good table manners like the white children when these same children reach adulthood they have the tendency to seek ideals they believe white people would embrace they play golf form bridge clubs garden clubs and even take trips to europe for basically the same reason with which they have been indoctrinated since early childhood now there isnt anything wrong in encouraging children to practice good health habits or to desire the finer things in life neither is bridge golf or a european tour undesirable it is the motive for doing these things that is undersirable why not simply do these things because they will enrich ones life one should accept new behavior patterns and ideals because they will make one a happier person the practice of behaving the way one thinks another race behaves in order to acquire happiness is absurd  how can one be sure that the adoption of certain behavior patterns can bring happiness what is wrong with enjoying a barbecue instead of a garden party what is wrong with a western film instead of a shakespearean play if one would enjoy and understand it better what is wrong with being ones self  just plain you self improvement doesnt come from pretense the idea that another race is truly happy doing these things is based on circumstantial evidence supplied by mama when she worked for mrs soandso is an illiterate domestic worker qualified to properly judge and evaluate all the situations she encounters false assumptions are born this way negro propagandists are usually professional people who are in a position to guide and to help less fortunate negroes seldom do they extend a helping hand instead they assume a special kind of superiority they form tight little social knots whose only purpose is to see which individual can more closely resemble mamas picture of mrs soandso to the outsider their little game of mimicking seems to bring unbelievable pleasures they are secure in their own social paradise but are they really all it would take to rattle their apparent security would be the introduction of one white individual into their knot an example that comes to mind is the announcement made in an allnegro school that there would be a white studentteacher from the nearby recently integrated negro teachers college on the campus in a few weeks plans had to be made the principal carefully scrutinized his faculty to find the best suited criticteacher on his staff after this decision had been made slow learners and unkempt students were ushered into some other teachers classroom when the young apprehensive white student arrived fighting her own preconceived ideas she was presented with a classroom of spotless aboveaverage pupils one lone frightened student had turned an entire school upside down the principal and his faculty are considered to be highly respected members of the society knot why had they panicked why did they have to impress an apprentice in their own field why did inferiority run amuck did they secretly harbor feelings of white superiority its funny perhaps pathetic would be a better wordhow negro propagandists flaunt their superiority over other negroes when they are in their own realms then one lone white individual can shatter their facade the younger generation of negroes has also been able to see through their flimsy veneer they rebel against these modern uncle toms the young lack respect for teachers ministers social workers and even parents who attempt to force upon them a set of values that reek of phony security they ask the question why they find the game of mimicking disgusting not exactly knowing what to do about the situation they lash out against the white race in general and those members of their own race who expect them to swallow such beliefs this type of behavior is as wrong as the negro propagandist who mimics what he believes life is like in the whitefolks world hate campaigns and inferiority campaigns bear the same markings it is time for the negro to stop and reevaluate himself the recently passed civil_rights acts permit them the opportunity of seeing first hand not through mamas eyes what white americans are really like integrated educational facilities gives each individual the chance to judge people by his relationship with them superiority and inferiority have no place in this learning process todays first graders are learning for themselves what my generation had to literally play by ear they are learning that neither race of americans are all perfect or all imperfect all wealthy or all poverty stricken all highly educated or all illiterate perhaps they will be able to learn from each other superiority and inferiority must come from within a belief in ones self is the antidoteto the implantation of seeds of insecurity
in  many instances we are not as advanced in student government as other institutions but i am determined that were going to set up some kind of student government in which they the students handle all student discipline that does not stem from academic work this is not going to be wholeheartedly supported by all of the faculty but im going to get this approval i cant go any further with this kind of heavyhanded operation so im going to stop it james madison nabrit jr president of howard university had seemingly made his position clear in the interview carried in the washington post he reflected upon the gains of howards first  years and the goals and aspirations that he had for the future the centennial year was over halfcompleted and for the most part the scheduled year long activities had progressed as planned seldom drawing more than small recognition in the daily papers less than three weeks later ronald o ross and leonard mccants both students and cochairmen of project awareness introduced the evenings guest speaker lt gen lewis b hershey of the selective service as the general began to speak a youth at the rear of the auditorium stood and yelled beast another screamed america is the black mans battleground at this point approximately  students rushed to the stage waving signs saying america is the black mans battleground vietnam hell no and pictures of two hanging burned black men surrounded by a crowd of milling laughing whites the shock and bewilderment of the audience was visible evidence of their ignorance of the planned demonstration but perhaps even more important was the fact that over  per cent of the audience cheered and applauded while the youths expressed their indignation and beliefs on the stage shortly after his assistance off the stage by the university police and administrators gen hershey in a classical stroke of paternal benevolence said i agree with the right to dissent but this is not the way to do it im a guest here but i dont criticize my host for what has happened that statement was published in all the papers what was not published at that time was the statement he also made that    if you see a symbol of something that you are very much opposed to you take advantage of that symbol to protest it and i am a symbol i represent what these people are very much opposed to reactions were swift ronald ross one of the sponsors of the generals visit stated more of this type of reaction will occur until america solves its problem concerning the black man the other cosponsor was quotedas having said   as a black person myself i found the entire affair repulsive the following day ernest goodman howards public relations director was quoted in the washington evening star as saying that only one of the demonstrators who surged onto the stage was identified as a student others he said were nonstudents known to be active in protest demonstrations in the washington area whether it is for civil_rights against the war in vietnam or what have you president nabrit mailed the general an official apology while in front of cramton auditorium a press conference was being held to announce the formation of the black_power committee dr nathan hare the oklahomaborn sociologist shared the reading of a prepared statement with huey labrie a freshman from oakland calif and robin gregory the pretty naturalhaired homecoming queen the committee they began has as its goals the overthrow of the negro college with white innards and to raise in its place a militant black university which will counteract the whitewashing black students now receive in negro and white institutions and at the same time  responsible student leaders presented a statement to the press which stated that we decry and deplore the irresponsible premeditated and unforgivable manner in which gen hershey was treated and would like for it to be known that the manner in which these persons conducted themselves is in no way representative of the student community absent from the list of signatures was that of miss carolyn carter the editor of the hilltop the universitys student newspaper her comment the statement stinks on april  four students including miss gregory the homecoming queen were scheduled to appear before a university disciplinary committee on charges stemming from the hershey demonstration in order to show their feelings about the hearings some  or more students rallied and set fire to the hanging effigies of gen hershey pres nabrit and dean frank m snowden college of liberal arts after threatening to charge the committee room the dissenters regrouped on the campus and continued their rally the hearings were postponed for a later date one week later the faculty forum held a rally and charged the administration with three breeches of academic freedom denying students and faculty the use of campus institutions an unjust firing of a philosophy instructor and the kangaroo court trial of the students allegedly involved in the hershey affair the charge of denying the use of campus institutions was a result of the rescinding of permission to use cramton auditorium for a talk on vietnam by floyd mckissick the reason given for the rescinding order the facilities were overburdened during the centennial year keynote speakers at the rally were dr hare dr andress taylor of the english dept and prof ivan eames of the sociology dept unknown to anyone at that time all of these instructors would be fired within two months the following day about  students forced their way past three doors and down a corridor with the intention of halting the rescheduled disciplinary hearings encouraged by  students behind them they were only stopped by the locked door of the conference room the students called the hearings unfair and demanded that the charges be dropped or that the hearings be held in public the students refused to move until miss gregorys mother emerged from the conference room and stated that her daughter requested that they leave and allow her attorney to state his defense miss gregory came out and pleaded for compliance at which time jeroyd w jay greene a law student stated thats it brothers if she feels that she doesnt need or want our help then we have to respect her wishes to leave and they did jay greene was later to receive a letter stating that he would not be allowed to register in the fall almost daily rallies were being held in front of frederick douglass hall by the more vocal and militant members of the faculty and student body discussions and arguments ranged incessantly but the subjects seldom varied from black_power student autonomy the administration the draft and minister muhammad ali on saturday april rd dr hare the sociologist and former professional boxer addressed a nonuniversity authorized rally of   people in front of douglass hall brothers and sisters he began it took the black_power committee to bring to howard university a man who is a better fighter and a better man than i am   we who are gathered here today stand at the doorway of a new era of black pride and black selfassertion some men are born to lead us in this struggle one such man is muhammad ali the heavyweight champion of the world and minister of peace voicing the teachings of elijah muhammad proceeded to tell the sympathetic audience exactly why the black man is still catching hell the following week the university issued a  point statement which protests must be confined outside the lecture hall and limited to orderly picketing  a location shall be designated where students may conduct rallies at certain specified times  the university shall not allow itself to be converted into either a recruiting place or a regular forum for advocates of any particular ideology  discourtesy or incivility to guests visitors or members of the university shall not be permitted  students and faculty may exercise their rights as citizens as individuals and not as representatives of the university  a judiciary committee of students and faculty structured along the fundamentals of due process shall be maintained  all public announcements and news releases shall be cleared through the public relations office arrangements to have representatives of the public communications media present on campus must be cleared by the public relations office  all administrators faculty and students have a responsibility to abide by and support the above  lawlessness and disorder shall not be permitted  the university is dedicated to all races violations of any of the  by the academic community shall be dealt with by the university in obvious disregard of the mandate the black_power committee held a press conference immediately after the announcement and a hilltop editorial called the attempt to turn the office of public relations into a censorship bureau the most outrageous of all student groups began to close ranks bridge differences and temporarily overlook ideological and political differences in their shaky but growing solidarity the student groups at howard range from the traditionally conservative social greek organizations and elected student government through the new student autonomyseeking students rights organization sro and the militant secret black_power committee continual charges of outside agitators were reminiscent of george wallace but nonetheless visitors from new york philadelphia newark watts and other black centers were constantly on campus often speaking before groups of students and faculty members between classes sometimes teaching sometimes learning but most often criticizing and encouraging in an offcampus meeting a group of students and faculty members were meeting to discuss what could and should be done in light of the administrations policy statement it was finally agreed to boycott but the problems that would have to be overcome for a successful boycott were staggering in order to be successful it was clear that over  per cent of the student body would have to agree to stay out of classes how could a single program appeal to the black_power committee the sro the elected student government the greeks and the largest group of all at howard the nonaligned the committee agreed that if student demands were to be met it would be necessary to have at least one of the demands cover the needs of each student on campus on monday may  jay greene told a gathering of some  students that the boycott was    a movement to free us from bonds that do not allow us to act as adults and as individuals the charismatic law student denounced the universitys paternalistic and totalitarian policies at that time greene stated that the campus chapter of the american association of university professors aaup went on record as supporting the student protests against the disciplinary proceedings surrounding the hershey incident greene predicted that the boycott would be  per cent successful on the day preceding the boycott the university announced that threats on the life of president nabrit and other administration and faculty members had been received warning them to stay away from classes president nabrit was scheduled to be in new york on the day of the boycott    honoring a long standing commitment to receive an award from brotherhood in action inc and to confer with a number of officials at a rally on the steps of douglass hall the boycott leaders stressed that doorways to all buildings would be picketed during the boycott but that there would be no interference with anyone attempting to attend classes on the morning of the boycott students living offcampus were met on their arrival by boycott committee workers with copies of the list of demands and a schedule of the days activities by this time the list had been revamped and compromised many times in order to draw the widest possible support the demands listed on the final draft were  all charges against the four students allegedly taking part in the hershey incident be dropped as the university has no written code of conduct which they have violated  a guarantee in writing that no action retroactively or prospectively be taken against any student because of his or her political activities during the current academic year   abolishment of all senior comprehensive examinations since this university requires final exams in all courses and a minimum grade point average gpa of  to graduate the senior comprehensive which is an additional exam raises an inference that final exams and gpas have no validity in determining the academic proficiency of prospective graduates  that no faculty member be dismissed or denied promotion because of his political activism or nonconformity any university needs faculty members who espouse different or radical ideas because the academic growth of students depends upon exposure to different ideas and issues  that compulsory rotc be abolished  immediate repeal of the recent policy statement on student protest the policy as it now stands is totalitarian as well as paternalistic it is antithetical to academic freedom and is only an inducement to activist students to defy it thus it will tend to provoke demonstrations rather than accomplish its avowed purpose of curtailing demonstrations the signers included the student body president editor of the hilltop president of the liberal arts student council chairman of the sro chairman of the howard university student forum president of the interfraternity council and the black_power committee first on the agenda during the boycott was a faculty teachin in which the instructors spoke on any subject that pleased them it seems that the instructor who returned to microphone most often lectured on the absurdity of the boycott and the need for the students to return to their classes he was respectfully ignored a little later the record message to the grass roots by the late malcolm_x was played at eleven oclock a large contingent of law students marched from the law school to the university administration building with his back to the building william a blakely presidentelect of the student bar association faced a large crowd of students and read a petition opposing the policy statement that limited demonstrations over  law students had signed the petition including jay greene and arthur goldberg these two students were among those to be felled by the dismissal axe during the summer recess the atmosphere surrounding their dismissals was itself puzzling goldberg more so than greene greene prized for his ability to rap as well as for his academic standing constantly insisted that the students demand autonomy over nonacademic functions and that they take greater pride in being black arthur goldberg was another matter also an excellent student it appears that his one mortal sin was that of reputation formerly a leader of student unrest at berkeley he frequently longed to take an active part in the growing student unrest at howard but goldberg a jew felt that howard as a black school should be lead out from under its present problems by black students at that time  per cent of those students were staying out of their classes in the next few weeks all charges against miss gregory were dropped while the three young men were given written reprimands and deprived of the privilege of running for student offices during the next academic year almost as a prelude to the summers rebellious outbreaks across the country students and faculty members were stunned to discover early one morning that during the night someone or some group had spraypainted the words join the black guard in large black letters on the pillars of douglass hall along the side of the ira aldridge theater and on the side of an abandoned house harshly visible from the front of cramton auditorium a few days later fire department officials began investigating a series of suspicious blazes which had broken out on the campus students and faculty members were surprised to discover armed patrolmen and fire marshals in the corridors on each floor of the building the room in which i took one of my finals showed the result of one of those suspicious blazes the pulldown maps were little more than charred remains while that entire corner of the room was black every window in the room had cracked under the apparently intense heat if there was any doubt as to the seriousness of someones intentions it was eradicated while viewing the aftermath as i left the room i looked out the cracked windows at the recruitment appeal splattered on the wall a few hundred feet away join the black guard i wondered what would happen next during the fourth week of june i found out as many students had been predicting all along the university had waited until the summer and then fired five professors and expelled  students the american civil liberties union aclu requested howard to reinstate the ousted students and faculty until they could be given a hearing the aclu board charged that the faculty had been dismissed and the students barred without due process for exercising freedom of speech the aclu threatened legal action if the university refused to hold a hearing  the american association of university professors general secretary bestram davis sent a letter to the university asking howard to rescind its dismissal of five faculty members until they were accorded hearings the howard law alumni association of the greater washington area went on record as condemning the university andor interested parties responsible for the recent dismissal of students and faculty members without any semblance of administrative due process our condemnation flows from the fact that this unfair conduct is contrary to the historical role traditionally adhered to by howard university copies of the condemnation were sent to the board of trustees perhaps one of the most accurate gauges of student reaction was penned by law student taunya lovell banks in a letter to the editor of the washington post as a student i am fearful of the caliber of education i will receive in an atmosphere which openly and flagrantly stifles dissent and criticism    i am both outraged and ashamed that my university has reacted in this distasteful manner because a courageous few sought to maintain through dissent the ideals once fostered by howard universityas an institution and as a composite of individuals on monday july  president nabrit announced his desire to retire  as soon as the board of trustees can find a successor in a statement issued through the office of public relations the president was quoted as saying emphatically that the unrest that has plagued the universitys campus during the past year did not influence his decision to retire at this time the report further stated that he was    deeply distressed by the events of the past year as well as by the steps it became necessary for him to take in order to maintain law and order on the campus i was distressed too by the erroneous interpretation that some people gave to my actions intimating that i had deviated from my lifelong adherence to civil_rights civil liberties and freedom of speech the following day in a press conference president nabrit conceded that black_power on campus is all right until it disrupts the order that the process of education requires but when black_power attempts to make this a black institution it ceases to be a group in the civil_rights struggle and becomes an institution trying to set up control of howard    this would result in the elimination of white members of the board the administration the faculty and the students i have fought all my life for integration and i do not propose to preside over this kind of thing at howard the type of thing that he is presiding over at howard at this time is similar to the growing nationwide demand of more student voice in student affairs howard however has an element that makes its case a particular one and that element is black_power the absolute refusal of the majority of campus organizations to allow their names to be used on any boycott literature that carried the slogan is proof enough of the controversial atmosphere surrounding it yet the majority of the campus black_power advocates were not members of the militant black_power committee these students believe that the greatest and perhaps the only prospect for improving the welfare of black people will have to be a collective political economic and social effort it will begin with the realization that none of the governmental programs in existence in this country today have lifted the level of life of the average black man it means realizing that if the government of the united states were to allot five states to black people tomorrow to set up a nation we would be bankrupt by the middle of next week because we are neither ready nor prepared to administrate it means that once the rebellions that raced across the country are over we are going to have to be prepared to help rebuild a nation of people either within the present governmental setup or in a completely new context it can and must be done but as students we are going to need room to grow to meet and to discuss when  per cent of the student body boycotted last spring to show their desire for needed reforms their answer was a barrage of firings and dismissals it is not expected that that will be the end of student unrest dr hare has already turned down two offers at larger more richly endowed institutions while jay greene has refused an allexpense scholarship to the yale law school to remain here in washington and fight for his readmittance to howard the washington post in an editorial referred to the censureship clause of the university policy statement and called it    not only objectionably paternalistic but unenforceable and unlikely to be obeyed commenting on the dismissal of the faculty members and expulsion of the students the editorial stated without offering any judgment as to the merits of these disciplinary decisions some of which are now being contested in the courts we are left with a strong impression that they were made arbitrarily without the elements of a fair hearing and in a manner certain to exacerbate unrest and anger on the campus    this does not seem prudent policy in relation to a student body already seething it invites rebellion in the most cherished peaceful and nonviolent manner the students and faculty demonstrated their desires by boycotting classes and listing their reasons for doing so they were rebuked for their efforts but most tragic of all is the fact that the administration the students and the faculty all seek a greater howard unfortunately it still appears that the students and administration are on a collision course it is time to avert a needless but certain disaster postscript contrary to mr malsons wishes all did not go quietly and well when classes were resumed on september  as president james m nabrit jr addressed the student body more than  students and faculty members stalked out of cramton auditorium in protest against the universitys action in dismissing militant faculty members and expelling militant students outside the auditorium fired professor nathan hare spoke to the students and admonished them against listening to the lies of the university administration just put them out of business close them down because we are all domestic slaves mr hare is quoted as saying a suit challenging the dismissal of the students and the professors is pending in the united states court of appeals in washington d c a district court judge upheld the universitys action in the dismissals meanwhile dr nabrit has expressed some sympathy with the militants on the faculty and among the students he recognized that black people have grown tired of americas promises and that there is a spirit of revolt at work which will not be satisfied until a new order is established it is unfortunately true that negroes have not reaped the full harvest of their expectations 
africanamerican a y nationalism first came j into my life in  j when i heard brother malcolm_x speak for the first time since that time it has become the dominant ideology in my life to me it includes all the various aspects of being part of a group culturally africanamerican nationalism demands that we as black people accept the fact that we have a distinctive and valuable cultural heritage which we must cherish nourish and pass along to our children it means that songs must be sung books must be written plays must be performedall extolling the rich and varied cultural heritage of our people africanamerican nationalism demands that the accepted criteria for beauty for worthiness for esthetic value be determined by us based upon what is good for us politically africanamerican nationalism demands that our community leaders be chosen solely by us based upon their contributions to the progress and security of the total group it demands that our leaders be representatives of our group to the larger community a representative is an integral part of the group from which he comes while an intermediator usually stresses his neutrality between two opposing forces africanamerican nationalism demands group solidarity not the kind of solidarity which totally suppresses internal dissent but the kind which instantly solidifies against any outside threat to the group this kind of nationalism operates under the principle may my people always be right but my people right or wrong it recognizes the fact that this country is based on racial religious and national groupings and that the individual progresses as his group progresses africanamerican nationalism rejects extreme groupdefeating individualism instead it stresses collective group action as the best means for promoting progress and security it judges events both nationally and internationally in terms of how they affect our group if it helps our people its good if not forget it it recognizes that just as a strong and stable family relationship helps the individual in his dealings with other groups africanamerican nationalism forms a solid base for effective political power for its allows us to form alliances from a position of strength with other groups whose interests coincide with ours on a particular issue it accepts the fact that power is what ultimately counts in relationships between groups just as it does in relationship between countries that is why we must develop group power in our constant struggle for survival and continuation as a distinctive people we have to remember another old but pertinent cliche we have no permanent friends permanent interests economically africanamerican nationalism demands that we use collective economic power wherever it is feasible as a means to improve our groups economic position the important word is collective the group must pool its economic resources in order to gain a most elementary positioneconomic control of our communities this collective power can be used in two ways first the small businesses such as grocery stores laundries clothing stores restaurants must be owned by black people on a collective basis second in areas which we dont own but in which we spend heavily we must use collective economic power to force changes which will benefit the total group this would entail wellplanned and wellcoordinated programs of boycotts selective buying and other such tactics africanamerican nationalism regards such programs as powerful weapons in the struggle for liberation educationally africanamerican nationalism demands that black people finance and support schools and centers which will be used to promote group identity among our children in these schools and centers the imagecreating process will be completely controlled by nationalistminded teachers authors artists and musicians who will use their talents to give the children the proper symbols and knowledge needed to maintain strong group identity history for instance will be taught as interpreted by trained and competent black historians in the already existing public schools africanamerican nationalism demands that black parents and black teachers use all means at their disposal to insure that the public schools in black communities are geared to the needs of the students of those communities internationally africanamerican nationalism demands that we attempt to create a sound working relationship with our counterparts in africa this relationship will be based not on a solely emotional basis but on a practical belief that the progress of the africanamerican will ultimately help the africans and that as brother malcolm once said a strong and united africa will be a protection for black people everywhere africanamerican nationalism demands that we give our wholehearted support to the true african nationalists who are fighting to gain control of their continent it demands that we promote the cause of african nationalism in this country we must judge international events in terms of how they affect the cause of african nationalism finally africanamerican nationalism accepts the principle that our future wellbeing has to be based upon a strong relationship with africa and friendship with that portion of the colored world which offers friendship to us africanamerican nationalism is slowly increasing in strength among our people the espousers of group identity racial consciousness and black_power are all expressing a form of nationalism africanamerican nationalism is an ideology umbrella under which the human resources of our people can be utilized to insure group stability group progress and group security to me africanamerican nationalism is our only sure path to liberation
during the last decade coinciding with the explosion of negro civil_rights movements into public consciousnessa number of negro playwrights have gained considerable notice louis peterson lorraine hansberry ossie davis james baldwin leroi jones and others    collectors of awards and honors  a few catapulted into international fame and dramatic prominence    critical barometers and geiger counters whipped out to gauge possible winds trends and resulting fallout however this flurry of attention has tended to misrepresent the real status of negro playwrights despite an eminent handful negro dramatists remain sparse in number productions sporadic at most and scripts too few to indicate discernible trends last year during a forum on what negro playwrights are saying not even panel members could cite enough plays to make plural subject matter viable moreover even when deemed successfulthe critical and financial rewards reaped by a raisin in the sun excepted and on a smaller scale leroi joness dutchman  few productions have managed to recoup capitalization no the millenium has not been reached many factors contribute to this situation but surveying the total landscape of american theater results could hardly be otherwise the legitimate theater that fabulous invalid which compared to its electronic bedpartner is still dreamed of as the repository of high culture and artistic achievement in america hardly qualifies when examined from a negro viewpoint tirelessly predictably almost repetitiously on cue theater critics and other jeremiahs deplore rampant commercialism the monopoly of escapist musicals the dominance of brittle frothy comedies and the inadequacy of experimental ventures they also leave the impression that a little minor surgery would work wonders that palliatives could restore health but the patient is sicker than even the most pessimistic diagnosis suggests no matter how severe their prognosis pundits seldom question the basic structures or assumptions of their theater with rare exceptionsan occasional native play of quality or intermittent foreign infusions american legit theater even at its most ambitious seriousness is essentially a theater of the bourgeois by the bourgeois about the bourgeois and for the bourgeois a pretentious theater elevating the narrow preoccupations of restricted class interests to inflated universal significance tacitly assuming that its middleclass affluentoriented absorptions are central to the dominant human condition a theater rarely embracing broader frames of reference or more inclusive concerns a theatereven if it triedincapable of engaging the attention of anyone not so fortunate as to possess a college diploma or fivefigure salary more specifically a theater in its loftymodern niche  broadway offbroadway offoffbroadway happeningsland whereveroverwhelmingly riddled with works of ingroup concerns belleslettres pomposity instant despair stultifying boredom humorless humor hastypudding hijinks pseudoabsurdity and closetavant daring a theater of diversiona diversionary theater whose main problem is not that its too safe but that it is surpassingly irrelevant occasional productions of stature and significance must usually display a cachet of foreign authorship and reputation to justify presentation maybe this is all as it should be computer consensusas yet  doesnt spawn meaningful plays the most powerful country in the western world doesnt necessarily usher in a golden age of drama it is not surprising that the negro playwright and the power of his potential fits only peripherally into this spectrum by his mere historical placement in american society the negro exists as a disturbing presence an embarrassment to majority comfort an actuality deflating pretenses an implicit witness and cogent critic too immediate for attention also just as in real life a black playwrightsight unseen play unheard  is soothsayed as too bothersome a prod to the sleeping conscience of numerical superiors the stage establishment like hollywood consigns even the most innocuous negro subject matter to an ogrecategory of problem drama even sympathetic advisers constantly bug the dark craftsman to shun racial themes and aspire to that pantheon of olympian universality which all white playwrights ironically enough can enter by merely getting themselves born as one naive wellmeaning but frighteningly boorish scribe put itno longer negro playwright just playwright    whoever heard of batting an eyelash of lowercaste condescension when sean ocasey is mentioned as an irish playwright that the negro playwright is more or less excluded from legit boulevards is not a revelation for concern more important is the fact that even when produced within this environment the very essence of his creative function is jeopardized his plays by a majority least equipped to understand his intentions woefully apathetic or anesthetized to his experience often prone to distort his purpose spectators who though afflicted with selfimposed ignorance demand to be taught abcs at the very moment when the writer is impatient to explore the algebra of his thematic equations observers even when most sympathetic whose attitudes have been repeatedly shaped by preconceptions and misconceptions warped by superficial cliches and platitudesliberal conservative or radical though they may be catering to such insistences presages barren results with imagination shortcircuited valuable time is wasted clueing in exposition is demanded when action should be unfolding the obvious must be overillustrated and fantasy literalized finally when the curtain descends whether the writer has pampered illusions lectured ignorance comforted fears shouted for attention or flagellated consciences probability dictates his defeat and the victory of customerstriumphantly intact in their limitations with tears dried the shouting quieted or the aches of the catoninetails subsided the writer has been neatly appropriated usurped his creativity subvertedfor those negro playwrights eager to volunteer for this function theres no advice to offer they know the rules they play the game and take their chances but for a negro playwright committed to examining the contours contexts and depths of his experiences from an unfretted imaginative negro angle of vision the screaming need is for a sufficient audience of other negroes better informed through commonly shared experience to readily understand debate confirm or reject the truth or falsity of his creative explorations not necessarily an allblack audience to the exclusion of whites but for the playwright certainly his primary audience the first persons of his address potentially the most advanced the most responsive or most critical only through their initial and continuous participation can his intent and purpose be best perceived by others the validity of this premise has been borne out previously in other productions and most recently during the current run of my own plays happy ending and day of absence two works of satirical content written from an unapologetic negro viewpoint throughout the run negro attendance has averaged close to  per cent hundreds witnessing a professional play for the first time besides contributing immeasurably to the longevity of the run the freshness of their response immediacy of in volvement and spontaneity of participation have significantly underscored the essence of the works themselves and provided crucial illuminations for others with negroes responding all around white spectators congenitally uneasy in the presence of negro satire at least cant fail to get the message any future hope for the negro playwright depends upon whether or not this minuscule singular alltoinfrequent experience can be extended multiplied and made permanent as long as the negro playwright remains totally dependent on existing outlets he stands to continue as a pauper begging sustenance never knowing from day to day year to year whether a few scraps will be tossed his way even burgeoning taxsupported privately endowed repertory companies are beyond the reach of his ambition imagine rushing to present day of absence or any other work which would require jobbingin  negro actors when your roster only allows for two or three at mostoften tokens at that eventually an allembracing allencompassing theater of negro identity organized as an adjunct of some negro community might ideally solve the negro dramatists dilemma but such a development to memust arise as part of a massive effort to reconstruct the urban ghetto smallscale cultural islands in the midst of the ghettos separate and apart from a committed program of social and economic revitalization of slums are doomed to exotic isolation meanwhile potential talent ready for exercise cannot wait without engagement it lies dormant stillborn time passes aging proceeds the talent withers and eventually dies of nonuse if any hope outside of chance individual fortune exists for negro playwrights as a groupor for that matter negro actors and other theater craftsmenthe most immediate pressing practical absolutely minimally essential active first step is the development of a permanent negro repertory company of at least offbroadway size and dimension not in the future but now a theater evolving not out of negative need but positive potential better equipped to employ existing talents and spur the development of future ones a theater whose justification is not the gap it fills but the achievement it aspires towardno less high than any other comparable theater company of present or past world fame a theater concentrating primarily on themes of negro life but also resilient enough to incorporate and interpret the best of world dramawhatever the source a theater of permanence continuity and consistency providing the necessary home base for the negro artist to launch a campaign to win his ignored brothers and sisters as constant witnesses to his endeavors this is not a plea for either a segregated theater or a separatist one negroes constitute a numerical minority but negro experience from slavery to civil_rights has always been of crucial importance to americas existence theres no reason why whites could not participate in a theater dedicated to exploring and illuminating that experience if they found inspiration in the purpose also just as the intrusion of lower middleclass and workingclass voices reinvigorated polite effete english drama so might the negro a most potential agent of vitality infuse life into the moribund corpus of american theater
one more river to cross by will henry is published by random house new york and sells for  the subtitle is the life and legend of isom dart the author employs the biblical usage of changing a persons name after an extremely significant event occurs in his life ned huddleston is the name that this exslave uses through most of his life and he ends up being called isom dart this novel is ostensibly based on a western folk tale and the story is based on legendary events in the history of isom dart the notion of adding to the repertoire of american folk tales the story of a black man is an excellent idea certainly it is important to the american literary scene that this be done in that the main body of this countrys folklore displays a conspicuous absence of the contributions of the people of african ancestry parenthetically it would help if historians would stop camouflaging the racial origins of the many blacks who have made significant contributions and are disguised by these historians as white will henry has written a great many folk stories based on western legends and seems to know a great deal about living patterns in the west however he fails miserably in his attempt to portray isom dart as a heroic figure in fact a reading of this book makes one ask why he bothered to describe such a pitiful character his efforts are ludicrous when one realizes that he even intended to create a heroic figure maybe mr henry just could not believe the legend of isom dart as he has heard it and amended it to fit his own picture of a black man the author superficially portrays isom dart as a fierce and brave figure whose reputation strikes fear in the hearts of anyone who hears about him for miles around isom dart is realistically fearless and his horsemanship tracking and hunting ability is unequaled during the course of his life isom has to kill many mexicans and indians without any psychological problems however when confronted by an armed white southerner who disarms himself and whips isom with isoms whip all that mighty isom is able to do is to drop to his hands and knees not to strike back the white man left him there disdaining even to look back at him our hero isom stayed down once was not enough for our author there is a repeat performance in the last episode in the novel this time it is even better after tracking down a white man who has killed isoms beloved adopted halfbreed daughter and while facing the white villain with gun in hand it reads boy    youre plain lucky the way things are now you understand me uncle im weary and wore down and i wont say it twice you go and get your horse and you get on him and you get the hell over the river yonder and you keep going    rash the white man was not wearing a gun  he waited upon the will of isom dart and waited    but isom did not strike    yes suh said the tall negro and turned away perhaps the authors basic problem can be traced to a statement made early in the story when isom then called ned is trying to plot his future course he recalls his childhood in his musing the author puts these words in his mind ned reared in kindness and treated decently all his boyhood life if will henry can conceive of a slave being treated kindly and decently then he is in bad shape as an author who intends to portray an authentic human being words like these cannot even be thought of when one is attempting to describe the tragic and despicable lot of a black slave of a white man in conclusion mr henry had better stick to writing about white heroes and leave the dramatization of blacks to blacks
before he was killed in colombia last year the catholic priest camilo torres admonished his countrymen who at least in pose shared his religious affiliationthat not one of them who was not on the side of the people who was not in essence involved in the revolution against the rulers could rightly consider himself catholic i think while not attempting a definition of what catholic in fact is that the catholicism of camilo torres as an expression of his religion obtained a special relation to man as a being it was of course precisely that relationship to man that placed him at odds with and indeed made him an enemy of the state torres religion was the religion of john brown nat turner and malcolm_xand others whose destruction was essential to the prolongation of state over man but the religion of torres and i think this can be said empirically as well as sensed was not a religion shared by very many catholic priests in these united states thomas merton perhaps freedom from domination freedom to live ones own spiritual life freedom to seek the highest truth unabashed by any human pressure or any collective demand the ability to say ones own yes and ones own no and not merely to echo the yes and the no of state party corporation army or system this is inseparable from authentic religion writes trappist monk merton in conjectures of a guilty bystander doubleday  commenting on his work merton tell us maybe the best way to characterize this book is to say that it consists of a series of sketches and meditations some poetic and literary others historical and even theological fitted together in a spontaneous informal philosophic scheme in such a way that they react upon each other the slightly erratic structure of the book with its five separate parts into which many of the authors conjectures could as easily have fallen into one parts as they did seemingly fall into another keeps pace with that statement but the value of mertons christian reflections is in no way lessened by the fact that one occasionally loses patiencethe title of his book is no abstractionwith the lack of continuity merton is among the truly educated men of our time not in the narrow american sense meaning one who in becoming technically efficient took from a few courses in the humanities a superficial familiarity that might be used not unlike playing the piano as a social grace that elan of love the frenchman gabon insisted must be aroused if education is to have purpose is alive in merton or closer to home kenneth b clark suggested in the american scholar that in the training of human beings we must find some way to give them the assurance to love the security to be kind and the intergrity required for a functional empathy did he say mankind needs not more bombs but more mertonsthis rare noncolored man in whom the western assumption to know gives way to the educational imperative to think thomas merton is free of the american madness   a letter arrives from some woman in france a total stranger evidently an ardent catholic    asks me for the prayers of the monks of gethsemani that america may at last start a nuclear crusade against russia and draw all the fearful pusillanimous western nations with her into it all this in the name of religion christian    and serious we cannot stand it any longer she said i wonder that god can stand it no network would have broadcast the merton report on the evening of november   it would have been too sane the country is undergoing a real emotional crisis    all the more so as oswald suspected of shooting kennedy has now been shot himself by a superpatriot a curious impulsive type a nightclub owner the whole thing is so odd it is barely credible or seven days later the whole question of the kennedy assassination is extremely complex and obscure    but now everybody wants it to be settled and settled it is all have agreed on the answer    the general justice is satisfied one feels that all have wanted a solution at any price and have taken the first one that was at hand is it good enough the perceptive merton discovers even in the monastery the kind of power struggle over absurdities that make life on this planet a satire he notes that there are people playing politics over whether the hoods should be up or down when the monks are listening to reading in the refractory and other little proprieties that mean nothing it is a question says merton of who shall have the last word who is boss in the end this kind of nonsense produces luthers or would do so if we had anyone around capable of becoming a luther fortunately we are all too stupid or too lazy it was merton who said in his book seeds of destruction most of us are congenitally unable to think black and yet that is precisely what we must do before we can even hope to understand the crisis in which we find ourselves    furthermore we do not bother really to listen to what the negro says because we assume that when the dialogue really begins he will already be thinking just like ourselves    the white jesus weve known so well could never issue a conjecture this honest the negro is clearly invited to one response he has had untold reasons for hating the white man they are now being solidly compounded and confirmed even though he has nothing whatever to gain by violence he has also nothing to lose and violence will at least be one decisive way of saying what he thinks of white society the result is likely to be very unpleasant and the blame will rest squarely on the shoulders of white america with its emotional cultural and political immaturity and its pitiable refusal of insight merton who considers himself neither conservative nor an extreme progressive is a man who sees and feels a man in whom the pragmatic question of the politiciancan we winis at all times subjected to the poets questioncan we be more fully human one cannot in reviewing this book say that it is good or bad or great it is a joy it might be said of merton as truman nelson has written of thoreauwhose affinity to nature lives on in merton that he has come to realize that there is an exalted form of individualism which merges into universality and becomes one with it i am tempted to think writes merton rather introspectively that the complexities of our own cenobitic system hem one in with arbitrary fantasies keep one in an absurd corner for the sake of some obscure principle or other some point of ideology in such a case to do what is really right one has to go at it backward as if he were doing something else

and promises to keep the southern conference for human welfare  vanderbilt university press  is a very exhaustive historical work that traces the most liberal efforts on the part of southerners to reform their society the author thomas a krueger went to great lengths to document this liberal group the southern conference for human welfare through its brief  years of life it is interesting to note the lengths to which the conservative south was willing to go in order to preserve its way of life in terms of the obvious social problems in the south this group did relatively little to solve these problems it tried valiantly and maybe in years to come history will tell what it did accomplish but the outstanding message of this book is that this group apparently did relatively nothing it was labeled out of existence with such titles as communist and radical the only consistent following it seemed to have were negroes which as the author points out did not help its image it is a duplication of an old story white people apparently are not going to do what is right just because they feel they should and an appeal from this perspective is futile this work is clear and objective however the same question could have been asked of the southern conference for human welfare as could be asked of the author why bother a year ago dodd mead  company published a book which received little notice but which should have considerable interest for those interested in black writers in general and in the harlem renaissance in particular the book was countee cullen and the negro renaissance by blanche e ferguson the book has characteristics of both a travelogue and a memoir much of the space is devoted to the poet cullens visit to europe and the holy land in the early twenties and of his long stay in paris under the auspices of a fellowship for the older generation there is the pleasure of recognition of the names and personalities who black and white influenced the black world in the period between the first world war and the end of the second one not many of the people remain alive today but a few of them doarna bontemps sterling a brown and saunders redding among them in a way countee cullen lived a gilded life in a gilded age his was not the hard brutal life endured by so many of his generation and he spent all of his life in the north for the younger generation the book provides an opportunity to gain an insight into a muchdiscussed and apparently overrated time the period the harlem renaissance however the young reader should be warned that the time and its people should be seen in the context of the world and history and should not be judged by todays yardstick
the christian role in todays society by the right reverend monsignor george a kelley is published by random house and is priced at  it is written by a man who has had a great many valuable experiences but it is like locking the barn after the horses have escaped the society that he calls todays sounds like society must have been at the turn of the century he symptomatically treats the issues of our culture his basic premise is that things are bad but he feels that if people would do what is right all of the problems will be alleviated for instance he very astutely describes the evils of segregation and discrimination however he sees the solution as arriving when white people stop doing mean things like that there is no prophetic proclamation that evil has its rewards he never deals with the question of the decay that these segregating people have already engendered he not only seems to be writing just to white people but he is also only writing to roman catholics his ideas are laced with roman catholic jargon and he very clearly    assumes a double standard ordinary people behave one way while roman catholics another the book might more aptly have been titled the catholic role in yesterdays society a quote from the book that bears these ideas out a hundred years ago what the majority of the population thought did not affect catholics they were in a minority these catholics were able to lead good christian lives without concerning themselves with problems beyond their own communities by remaining in close relationship one with the other they could and did live good and holy lives were they indeed good and holy while they condoned slavery worked little children justified colonizing the world treated women like dogs etc the point is foolish to argue that people are different now from what they once were like is ridiculous the fact is that environmental conditions change and therefore the potential contributions of people during each era are different another anachronism in this work is that the author is utilizing four teenth century catechismal didacticism he tells people what they are supposed to do this attitude is revealed in the title he says the christian role when if he were aware of any of the theological developments of the twentieth century he surely would have titled his book the christians role there could not be only one christian role yet he because of his title and his book seems to believe just that unlike monsignor kelley many of us have never believed in this good christian culture that he fears we are dangerously close to losing to many of us it has been too long in dying so that maybe we can now build a brotherhood of this world not just of the roman catholic churchmacfadden books has published a cheap  cents paperback student edition of africa in the united states which is very much a bargain the book is edited by vernon mckay who also contributed a chapter american interest in africa in an introduction to the book mr mckay writes that the symposium is designed to illustrate the rich plurality of american interests in africa and its future it does not tell the story of africa itself but focuses on the remarkable work of africa being done in the united states by thousands of americans through their government their civic organizations their schools and churches their philanthropic foundations their art museums and music centers and through other institutions to this end such articles are included as the image of africa in the united states by the late melville j herskovits african students in the united states by the house subcommittee on africa and us government programs on africa within the united states by fred l hadsel there is an interesting article on the influence of africans on american culture by john a davis former head of the american society of african culture dr davis comments on the historical alliances and associations between africans and afroamericans and makes some statements relative to the contemporary status of relationships between the two groups probably the most useful article in the book is adelaide cromwell hills consideration of african studies programs in the united states dr hill currently a research associate in the african studies program at smith college provides a reasonably comprehensive rundown on african studies programs which could serve admirably as a guide for anyone interested in such programs a buy well worth the money
africans were great story tellers long before their first appearance in jamestown virginia in  the rich and colorful history art and folklore of west africa the ancestral home of most afroamericans present evidence of this and more contrary to a misconception which still prevails the africans were familiar with literature and art for many years before their contact with the western world before the breaking up of the social structure of the west african states of ghana melle mali and songhay and the internal strife and chaos that made the slave trade possible the forefathers of the africans who eventually became slaves in the united states lived in a society where university life was fairly common and scholars were beheld with reverence there were in this ancestry rulers who expanded their kingdoms into empires great and magnificent armies whose physical dimensions dwarfed entire nations into submission generals who advanced the technique of military science scholars whose vision of life showed foresight and wisdom and priests who told of gods that were strong and kind to understand fully any aspect of afroamerican life one must realize that the black american is not without a cultural past though he was many generations removed from it before his achievements in american literature and art commanded any appreciable attention i have been referring to the african origin of afroamerican literature and history this preface is essential to every meaningful discussion of the role of the afroamerican in every major aspect of american life past and present before getting into the main body of this talk i want to make it clear that the black race did not come to the united states culturally emptyhanded i will elaborate very briefly on my statement to the effect that the forefathers of the africans who eventually became slaves in the united states once lived in a society where university life was fairly common and scholars were beheld with reverence during the period in west african historyfrom the early part of the fourteenth century to the time of the moorish invasion in  the city of timbuktu with the  university of sankore in the songhay empire was the intellectual center of africa black scholars were enjoying a renaissance that was known and respected throughout most of africa and in parts of europe at this period in african history the university of sankore at timbuktu was the educational capital of the western sudan in his book timbuktu the mysterious felix dubois gives us the following description of this period the scholars of timbuktu yielded in nothing to the saints in their sojourns in the foreign universities of fez tunis and cairo they astounded the most learned men of islam by their erudition that these negroes were on a level with the arabian savants is proved by the fact that they were installed as professors in morocco and egypt in contrast to this we find that the arabs were not always equal to the requirements of sankore i will speak of only one of the great black scholars referred to in the book by felix dubois  ahmed baba was the last chancellor of the university of sankore he was one of the greatest african scholars of the late sixteenth century his life is a brilliant example of the range and depth of west african intellectual activity before the colonial era ahmed baba was the author of more than  books nearly every one of these books had a different theme he was in timbuktu when it was invaded by the moroccans in  and he was one of the first citizens to protest this occupation of his beloved home town ahmed baba along with other scholars was imprisoned and eventually exiled to morocco during his expatriation from timbuktu his collection of  books one of the richest libraries of his day was lost now west africa entered a sad period of decline during the moorish occupation wreck and ruin became the order of the day when the europeans arrived in this part of africa and saw these conditions they assumed that nothing of order and value had ever existed in these countries this mistaken impression too often repeated has influenced the interpretation of african and afroamerican life in history for over  years years negroes played an important part in american life history and culture long before  our relationship to this country is as old as the country itself africans first came to the new world as explorers they participated in the exploratory expeditions of balboa the discoverer of the pacific and cortes the conqueror of mexico an african explorer helped to open up new mexico and arizona and prepared the way for the settlement of the southwest africans also accompanied french jesuit missionaries on their early travels through north america in the united states the art and literature of the negro people has had an economic origin much that is original in black american folklore or singular in negro spirituals and blues can be traced to the economic institution of slavery and its influence upon the negros soul after the initial poetical debut of jupiter hammon and phillis wheatley the main literary expression of the negro was the slave narrative one of the earliest of these narratives came from the pen of gustavas vassa an african from nigeria this was a time of great pamphleteering in the united states the free africans in the north and those who had escaped from slavery in the south made their mark upon this time and awakened the conscience of the nation their lack of formal educational attainments gave their narratives a strong and roughhewed truth more arresting than scholarship gustavas vassa established his reputation with an autobiography first printed in england vassa born in  was kidnapped by slavers when he was  years old and taken to america he was placed in service on a plantation in virginia eventually he was able to purchase his freedom he left the united states made his home in england and became active in the british antislavery movement in  he presented a petition to parliament to abolish the slave trade his autobiography the interesting narrative of the life of gustavas vassa was an immediate success and had to be published in five editions at the time when slave ships were still transporting africans to the new world two th century negroes were writing and publishing works of poetry the first of these was jupiter hammon a slave in queens village long island in  hammon published an evening thought salvation by christ with penitential cries  in all probability this was the first poem published by an american negro his most remarkable work an address to the negroes of new york was published in  jupiter hammon died in  phillis wheatley  like hammon was influenced by the religious forces of wesleywhitefield revival unlike hammon however she was a writer of unusual talent though born in africa she acquired in an uncredibly short time both the literary culture and the religion of her new england masters her writings reflect little of her race and much of the age in which she lived she was a new england poet of the third quarter of the th century and her poems reflected the poetic conventions of the boston puritans with whom she lived her fame continued long after her death in  and she became one of the  best known poets of new england another important body of literature came out of this period it is the literature of petition written by free black men in the north who were free in name only some of the early petitioners for justice were caribbeanamericans who saw their plight and the plight of the afroamericans as one and the a  same in th century america two of the most outstanding fighters for liberty and justice were the west indiansprince hall and john b  russwurm when prince hall came to the united states the nation was in turmoil the colonies were ablaze with indignation britain with a series of revenue acts had stoked the fires of colonial discontent in virginia patrick henry was speaking of liberty or death the cry no taxation without representation played on the nerve strings of the nation prince hall then a delicatelooking teenager often walked through the turbulent streets of boston an observer unobserved a few months before these hectic scenes he had arrived in the united states from his home in barbados where he was born about  the son of an englishman and a free african woman he was in theory a free man but he knew that neither in boston nor in barbados were persons of african descent free in fact at once he questioned the sincerity of the vocal white patriots of boston it never seemed to have occurred to them that the announced principles motivating their action was stronger argument in favor of destroying the system of slavery the colonists held in servitude more than a half million human beings some of them white yet they engaged in the contradiction of going to war to support the theory that all men  were created equal when prince hall arrived in boston that city was the center of  the american slave trade most of the major leaders of revolutionary movement in fact were slaveholders or investors in slavesupported businesses hall like many other americans wondered what did these men mean by freedom the condition of the free black men as prince hall found them was not an enviable one emancipation brought neither freedom nor relief from the stigma of color they were still included with slaves indentured servants and indians in the slave codes discriminatory laws severely circumscribed their freedom of movement by  prince hall saw little change in the condition of the blacks and though a freeman at least in theory he saw his people debased as though they were slaves still in bondage these things drove him to prepare himself for leadership among his people so through diligence and frugality he became a property owner thus establishing himself in the eyes of white people as well as the blacks but the ownership of property was not enough he still had to endure sneers and insults he went to school at night and later became a methodist preacher his church became the forum for his peoples grievances ten years after his arrival in boston he was the accepted leader of the black community in  hall petitioned the massachusetts legislature protesting the kidnapping of free negroes this was a time when american patriots were engaged in a constitutional struggle for freedom they had proclaimed the inherent rights of all mankind to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness hall dared to remind them that the black men in the united states were human beings and as such were entitled to freedom and respect for their human personality prejudice made hall the father of african secret societies in the united states he is the father of what is now known as negro masonry hall first sought initiation into the white masonic lodge in boston but was turned down because of his color he then applied to the army lodge of an irish regiment his petition was favorably received on march   hall and fourteen other black americans were initiated in lodge number  when on march  the british were forced to evacuate boston the army lodge gave prince hall and his colleagues a license to meet and function as a lodge thus on july   african lodge no  came into being this was the first lodge in masonry established in america for men of african descent the founding of the african lodge was one of prince halls greatest achievements it afforded the africans in the new england area a greater sense of security and contributed to a new spirit of unity among them halls interest did not end with the lodge he was deeply concerned with improving the lot of his people in other ways he sought to have schools established for the children of the ¦ free africans in massachusetts of prime importance is the fact that prince hall worked to secure respect for the personality of his people and also played a significant role in the downfall of the massachusetts slave trade he helped to prepare the groundwork for the freedom fighters of the th and th centuries whose continuing efforts have brought the black american closer to the goal of full citizenship the literature of petition was continued by men like david walker whose appeal an indictment of slavery was published in  dynamic ministers like samuel ringgold ward and henry highland garnet joined the ranks of the petitioners at the time a journalist literature was being born frederick douglass the noblest of american black men of the th century was the leader of the journalist group he established the newspaper north star and later the magazine douglass monthly john b russwurm and samuel cornish founded the newspaper freedoms journal in  in  a third poet george moses horton published his book the hope of liberty in his second volume naked genius   he  expressed his antislavery convictions more clearly george moses horton was the first slave poet to openly protest his status throughout the early part of the m th century the slave narrative became a new form of american literary expression the best known of these slave narratives came from the pen of frederick douglass the foremost negro in the antislavery movement his first book was the narrative of the life of frederick douglass  ten years later an improved and enlarged edition my bondage and my freedom was published his third autobiography life and times of frederick douglass was published in  and enlarged in  douglass fought for civil_rights and against lynching and the ku klux klan no abuse of justice escaped his attention and his wrath it was not until  that an afroamerican writer emerged who was fully a master of the short story as a literary form this writer was charles w chesnutt chesnutt an ohioan by birth became a teacher in north carolina while still in his middle teens he studied the traditions and superstitions of the people that he taught and later made this material into the ingredient of his best short stories in august  his short story the goophered grapevine appeared in the atlantic monthly this was the beginning of a series of stories which were later brought together in his first book the conjure woman  the wife of his youth also appeared in the atlantic july  and gave the title to his second volume the wife of his youth and other stories of the color line  three more stories appeared later baxters procrustes in the atlantic june  and the doll and mr taylors funeral in the crisis magazine april  and aprilmay  chesnutts novel did not measure up to the standards he had set with his short stories though they were all competently written in  he was awarded the spingarn medal for his pioneer work as a literary artist depicting the life and struggle of americans of negro descent paul laurence dunbar a contemporary of charles w chesnutt made his reputation as a poet before extending his talent to short stories both dunbar and chesnutt very often used the same subject matter in their stories chesnutt was by far the better writer and his style and attitude differed radically from dunbars dunbars pleasant folk tales of traditionbound plantation black folk were more acceptable to a large white reading audience with preconceived ideas of negro characteristics in all fairness it must be said that dunbar did not cater to this audience in all of his stories in such stories as the tragedy at three forks the lynching of jube benson and the ordeal of mt hope he showed a deep concern and understanding of the more serious and troublesome aspects of afroamerican life collections of his stories are folks from dixie  the strength of gideon  in old plantation days  and the heart of happy hollow  only one of his novels the sport of the gods  is mainly concerned with afroamerican characters chesnutt and dunbar in their day reached a larger general reading audience than any of the black writers who came before them the period of the slave narratives had passed yet the black writer was still an oddity and a stepchild in the eyes of most critics this attitude continued in a lessening degree throughout one of the richest and most productive periods in afroamerican writing in the united statesthe period called the negro renaissance the community of harlem was the center and spiritual godfather and midwife for this renaissance the cultural emancipation of the afroamerican that began before the first world war was now in full force the black writer discovered a new voice within himself and liked the sound of it the white writers who had been interpreting our life with an air of authority and a preponderance of error looked at last to the black writer for their next cue in short story collections like jean toomers cane  and langston hughes the ways of white folks  heretofore untreated aspects of afroamerican life were presented in an interesting manner that was unreal to some readers because it was new and so contrary to the stereotypes they had grown accustomed to in her book mules and men  zora neal hurston presented a collection of folk tales and sketches that showed the close relationship between humor and tragedy in afroamerican life in doing this she also fulfilled the first requirement of all booksto entertain and guide the reader through an interesting experience that is worth the time and attention it takes to absorb it in other stories like the gilded six bits drenched in light and spunk another side of miss hurstons talent was shown in the midst of this renaissance two strong voices from the west indians were heard claude mckay in his books gingertown  and banana bottom  wrote of life in his jamaican homeland in a manner that debunked the travelogue exoticism usually attributed to negro life in the caribbean area before the publication of these books harlem and its inhabitants had already been the subject matter for a group of remarkable short stories by mckay and the inspira tion for his book home to harlem still the most famous novel ever written about that community in  eric walrond a native of british guiana explored and presented another side of west indian life in his book tropic death a near classic in these  naturalistic stories eric walrond concerns himself mostly with labor and living conditions in the panama canal zone where a diversity of people and ways of life meet and clash while each tries to survive at the expense of the other clear perception and strength of style enabled mr walrond to balance form and content in such a manner that the message was never intruded upon the unfolding of the stories rudolph fisher another bright star of the harlem literary renaissance was first a brilliant young doctor the new and light touch he brought to his stories of afroamerican life did not mar the serious aspect that was always present the message in his comic realism was more profound because he was skillful enough to weave it into the design of his stories without destroying any of their entertainment value his stories blades of steel the city of refuge and the promised land were published in the atlantic monthly high yaller appeared in the crisis magazine during the heyday of that publication and was later reprinted in the obrien anthology best short stories of  unfortunately he died before all of his bright promise was fulfilled the harlem literary renaissance was studded with many names those already mentioned are only a few of the most outstanding during the period of this literary flowering among black writers harlem became the mecca the stimulating holy city drawing pilgrims from all over the country and from some places abroad talented authors playwrights painters and sculptors came forth eagerly showing their wares three men w e b du bois james weldon johnson and alain locke cast a guiding influence over this movement without becoming a part of the social climbing and pseudointellectual aspect of it w e b du bois by continuously challenging the old concepts and misinterpretations of afroamerican life gave enlightened new directions to a whole generation as editor of the crisis he introduced many new black writers and extended his helpful and disciplining hand when it was needed following the death of booker t washington and the decline of the booker t washington school of thought he became the spiritual father of the new black intelligentsia james weldon johnson moved from florida to new york his diversity of talent established his reputation long before the beginning of the new negro literary movement later as a participant in and historian of the movement he helped to appraise and preserve the best that came out of it in his books autobiography of an excolored man  the book of a merican negro poetry  black manhattan  and along this way an autobiography  james weldon johnson showed clearly that negro writers have made a distinct contribution to the literature of the united states his own creative talent made him one of the most able of these contributors alain locke is the writer who devoted the most time to the interpretation of the new negro literary movement and to afroamerican literature in general in  he expanded the special t harlem issue of the magazine survey graphic which he edited into the anthology the new negro this book is a milestone and a guide to afroamerican thought literature and art in the middle twenties the objective of the volume to register the transformation of the inner and outer life of the negro in america that had so significantly taken place in the last few preceding years was ably achieved for many years mr lockes annual appraisal of books by and about negroes published in opportunity magazine was an eagerly awaited literary event early in the harlem literary renaissance period the black ghetto became an attraction for a varied assortment of white celebrities and just plain thrillseeking white people lost from their moorings some were insipid rebels defying the mores of their upbringing by associating with negroes on a socially equal level some were too rich to work not educated enough to teach and not holy enough to preach others were searching for the mythological noble savage the exotic negro these professional exotics were generally college educated negroes who had become estranged from their families and the environment of their upbringing they talked at length about the great books within them waiting to be written their white sponsors continued to subsidize them while they developed their latent talent of course the great books of these camp followers never got written and eventually their white sponsors realized that they were never going to writenot even a good letter ironically these sophisticates made a definite contribution to the period of the new negro literary renaissance in socially inclined company they proved that a black american could behave with as much attention to the details of social protocol as the best bred and richest white person in the country they could balance a cocktail glass with expertness behind their prem tense of being writers they were  really actorsand rather good ones they were generally better informed than their white sponsors and could easily participate in a discussion of the writings of marcel proust in one minute and the music of ludwig von beethoven the next as social parasites they conducted themselves with a smoothness approaching an artistic accomplishment unknown to them their conduct had done much to eliminate one of the major prevailing stereotypes of afroamerican life and manners concurrently with the unfolding of this mildly funny comedy the greatest productive period in afroamerican literature continued the more serious and talented black writers were actually writing their books and getting them published opportunity magazine then edited by charles johnson and the crisis edited by w e b du bois were the major outlets for the new black writers opportunity short story contests provided a proving ground for a number of competent black writers among the prize winners were cecil blue john f matheus eugene gordon and marita bonner writers like walter white jessie fauset wallace thurman nella larsen george s schuyler sterling a brown and arna bontemps had already made their debut and were accepted into the circle of the matured the stock market collapse of  marked the beginning of the depression and the end of the period known as the negro renaissance the exotic negro professional and otherwise became less exotic now that a hungry look was upon his face the numerous white sponsors and wellwishers who had begun to flock to harlem ten years before no longer had time or money to explore and marvel over harlem life many harlem residents lived and died in harlem during this period without once hearing of the famous literary movement that had flourished and declined within their midst it was not a mass movement it was a fad partly produced in harlem and partly imposed on harlem most of the writers associated with it would have written just as well at any other time in the intervening years between the end of the negro renaissance and the emergence of richard wright black writers of genuine talent continued to produce books of good caliber the lack of sponsorship and pampering had made them take serious stock of themselves and their intentions the crisis organ of the national association for the advancement of colored people and opportunity organ of the national urban league continued to furnish a publishing outlet for new black writers the general magazines published stories by black writers intermittently seemingly on a quota basis during this period writers like ralph ellison henry b jones marian minus ted poston lawrence d reddick and grace w thompkins published their first short stories in  richard wrights first short story to receive any appreciable attention big boy leaves home appeared in the anthology the new caravan the ethics of living jim crow an autobiographical sketch was published in american stuff anthology of the federal writers project the next year in  when his first book uncle toms children won a  prize contest conducted by story magazine his talent received national attention with the publication of his phenomenally successful novel native son in  a new era in afroamerican literature had begun here at last was a black writer who undeniably wrote considerably better than many of his white contemporaries as a short story craftsman he was the most accomplished black writer since charles w chesnutt after the emergence of richard wright the period of indulgence for negro writers was over hereafter black writers had to stand or fall by the same standards and judgments used to evaluate the work of white writers the era of the patronized and pampered black writer had at last come to an end the closing of this era may in the final analysis be the greatest contribution richard wright made to the status of negro writers and to negro literature when the united states entered the second world war the active negro writers like most other writers in the country turned their talents to some activity in relation to the war the first short stories of ann petry began to appear in the crisis the negro caravan the best anthology of negro literature since alain locke edited the new negro sixteen years before had already appeared with much new material chester b himes a dependable writer during the depression period managed to turn out a number of remarkable short stories while working in shipyards and war industries in california in  he received a rosenwald fellowship to complete his first novel if he hollers let him go in  frank yerby won an o henry memorial award for his excellent short story health card which had been published in harpers magazine a year before a new crop of postwar black writers was emerging in their stories they treated new aspects of afroamerican life or brought new insights to the old aspects principally they were good story tellers aside from any message they wanted to get across to their readers the weepy sociological propaganda stories so prevalent during the de pression era had had their day with the negro writer and all others there would still be protest stories but the protest would now have to meet the standards of living literature opportunity and the crisis once the proving ground for so many new black writers were no longer performing that much needed service the best of the new writers found acceptance in the general magazines among these are james baldwin lloyd brown arthur p davis owen dodson lance jeffers john o killens robert h lucas albert murray george e norford carl r offord john h robinson jr john caswell smith jr and mary e vroman with the rise of nationalism and independent states in africa and the rapid change of the status of the negro in the united states the material used by black writers and their treatment of it did of necessity reflect a breaking away from the old mooring among black writers the period of the s was the period of richard wright the period of the s was the period of james baldwin the now flourishing literary talent of james baldwin had no easy birth and he did not emerge overnight as some of his new discoverers would have you believe for years this talent was in incubation in the ghetto of harlem before he went to europe a decade ago in an attempt to discover the united states and how he and his people relate to it the book in which that discovery is portrayed the fire next time is a continuation of his search for place and definition baldwin more than any other writer of our times has succeeded in restoring the personal essay to its place as a form of creative literature from his narrow vantage point of personal grievance he has opened a window on the world  he plays the role traditionally assigned to thinkers concerned with the improvement of human conditionsthat of alarmist he calls national attention to things in the society that need to be corrected and things that need to be celebrated when richard wright died in paris in  a new generation of black writers partly influenced by him was beginning to explore as ralph ellison said the full range of american negro humanity in the short stories and novels of such writers as frank london brown william melvin kelly leroi jones paule marshall rosa guy and ernest j gaines both a new dimension and a new direction in writing is seen they have questioned and challenged all previous interpretations of afroamerican life in doing this they have created the basis for a new american literature the black writer and his people are now standing at the crossroads of history this is the black writers special vantage point and this is what makes the task and the mission of the black writer distinctly different from that of the white writer the black writer concerned with creating a work of art in a segregated society has a double task first he has to explain the society to himself and create his art while opposing that society second he cannot be honest with himself or his people without lending his support at least verbally to the making of a new society that respects the dignity of men the black writer must realize that his people are now entering the last phase of a transitional period between slavery and freedom it is time for the black writer tos draw upon the universal values in his peoples experience just as sean ocasey and sholem aleichem drew upon the universal values in the experiences of the irish and the jews in the next phase of afroamerican writing a literature of celebration must be created not a celebration of oppression but a celebration of survival in spite of it

fading in the distance the man drove silently toward the main highway careening down the narrow dirt road steering with one hand as he fumbled in his trouser pocket and extracted a crumpled pack of camels with a small tarnished silver pocket lighter he applied flame to the cigarette inhaling deeply she huddled closer to the window trying to escape the smoke fumes but instead breathing in the dust from the road she felt perspiration begin to flow warmly down her body embarrassed she pushed her arms tightly against her sides hoping the gesture would stop the rivulets this was the first time she was to take care of his children and she didnt want him to think her unclean but it was so hot especially sitting on this side facing the sun the back road ended at the stop sign clumsily he scraped the gears his hand brushing her knee the road he turned on was paved and fringed with scattered old farm houses not far now he said interrupting the long silence narrowing his eyes at her he continued slowly ah hear you a pretty good babysitter carrie mae least thats what mista gordy says she smiled proudly mister gordy was rich and important and didnt let everybody keep his children ah takes care of mista gordys chillen the best way ah know how mista will mama always says if anythings worth doing its worth doing right he didnt say anymore just stared at the road cigarette hanging from his mouth his face appeared preoccupied immobile except for his squinting occasionally when smoke got in his eyes she wondered about his children their ages whether they were hard to keep or nice as the gordys pretty gal like you go to school he asked abruptly yes suh ahm in the seventh grade she was a little ashamed knowing she ought to be going to the county high school but when cotton picking time came the colored children had to work in the fields and school closed the cigarette was down to the mans lips now he threw it out the window and reached in his pocket again for the pack finding it empty he threw it out too the car reached the towns entrance and screeched to a stop at the red light when the light turned green his hand brushed her knee like before feeling hot and prickly to her flesh she moved without seeming to move closer to the door believing she was in the way as if he had forgotten the turn he wheeled the car roughly off the main highway to a dirt road amidst screeching brakes and burning rubber she was thrown against him her body touched the strong muscle of his arm which seemed to tighten at the contact and she caught the pungent sweaty odor of him mixed with a strange sour apple smell resembling the homemade wine mama served company at christmas time she slid quickly over in her corner hoping he wasnt mad halfexpecting a sharp rebuke white folks here didnt like colored to get too near them she knew that by the colored and white signs that were in town the signs their preacher said shouldnt be there anymorebut they were it was something for her to be sitting here on the front seat with him the reason she knew because there wasnt any back seat without looking directly at him she saw he was breathing hard his chest moving in and out like he had been running too fast he pressed harder on the gas and the car sped faster past the corn fields sweltering in the sun blaze and on until snarling brush weeds and tall cool trees took up where the fields ended finally he jerked to a stop in front of a decrepit white onestory frame house needing paint cardboard venetian blinds hung crookedly covering the front windows while faded green shutters sagged weakly from their hinges git out he said tautly as if something had caught in his throat he started up the pebbled path his naked brown back sweat glistening in the sun she followed slowly avoiding the decapitated doll whose face was inches away from the crushed body inside the living room was dimly obscured by the drawn blinds a greasy bacon smell permeated the housethe thick kind brought on from too hurried frying with the house closed the room was small burdened with a crushed red horse hair sofa matching chair and scarred walnut coffee table her  eyes rested on a picture of a fat smiling stringy haired woman holding a baby while a small boy tugged at her dress christ the man breathed taking off his cap and throwing it on a chair its hottern hell but he made no effort to open the windows or doors he went through the narrow doorway into the kitchen from where she stood she could see him opening the icebox and taking out a bottle of beer she scarcely moved until he called comon out here soundlessly she went into the kitchen here the smell was stronger soiled dishes with coagulated yellow egg and hardened white grease stains were piled in the sink a babys high chair was beside the table freckled with dried pablum she felt the man watching her closely as he sucked thirstily on the beer cold sweat ran down the bottles sides the coldness made her more conscious of the heat and dust still peppering her throat she wanted a glass of water but custom and habit made her keep silent my wife didnt have no time to clean up before she left he said motioning she wondered if he expected her to if so maybe she could get more money aunt died in the city he went on flatly she felt rooted to the spot as perspiration dampened her face a surging inadequate wave swept over her causing her to feel young and unwittingly helpless some whites were peculiar and took their own gooddoing time about telling you what to do others like mama once said just thought you ought to know what they wanted done should she start with the dishes and where were the children she listened hard thinking maybe they were asleep or outside playing but there were no visible sounds except for a birds lonely chirpno sounds at all you know carrie mae youre twice as goodlooking as theyre saying in town he commented eyes travelling slowly over her face and down to pause at the sprouting breasts like pointed cones the way he said it mouth barely moving tongue moistening his lips made an alien hotness aside from the rooms heat envelop her she stared childishly wideeyed questioning straining for any sound beside the birds mocking chirp finishing the beer he tossed the bottle in the filled can near the sink seeing her unconsciously follow the movement he smiled thinly want one astonished she shook her head she had never tasted beer before but maybe she should have said yes since he was white maybe he was going to get mad because she didnt or could be testing her to see if she was dependable a hundred shuttering maybes tore through her ¦ just one aint gonna hurt he laughed leaning back against the sink its nice n cold n gives you a real nice feeling ah dont drink beer mista will his face took on a pretended surprise you mean you aint never sat in that niggrah beer garden in town on satday night numbly her head moved slowly from side to side of course she had never sat in that beer garden why mama would die she could see mama now on saturdays when they went into town to shop how mama pinched lipped would drag her quickly by the place noisily thumping out music and loose laughter while beer and whiskey smells floated out and tainted the air aw comon now carrie mae he said voice lowering intimately now ah just know pretty you are you sneak there with boys sometimes dont you no suh she denied shaking her head never well where do you go with the boys the questions bewildered her she couldnt understand them or why this white man would even bother to ask her such things she saw his eyes were strangely aflame blazing with a queer brittle light reminding her of a mirror throwing out a sun glaze ah dont go nowheres with no boys mista will mama say ahm too young to keep compny water was running down her face freely now she wished he would stop asking all those things and tell her what to do and she wished he would let some air in the closeness seemed to be affecting him too for sweat was lacing his face and chest he didnt seem to mind it though standing there arms folded lounging back on the sink watching her yeah he murmured tightly you suren hell pretty as they say she didnt know whether to feel good about what he was saying or not and were those they the white men who loafed by the pool hall smirking and saying nasty things to the colored girls going by she was puzzled and didnt say anything comere she stiffened a constriction gathering in her chest comere ah said he straightened up tensing himself on the balls of his feet a knot worked in his jaws when his eyes moved to her breast again dont be scared ah aint going to hurt you she walked stiffly toward him her eyes fearful closer she could smell the beer she stopped warily not too close not too far away enough to show the white man she had obeyed  suddenly his arms reached out and snatched her against him her nose was pushed into the brush thicket of his chest as his arms imprisoned her relax now he said arms entombing her body like ah said ah aint gonna hurt you just thought we twod have a little fun mista will she began eyes enlarged in terror ahm sppose to keep your chillen suh you said you wanted me to keep your chillen he was breathing harshly now like in the car and his face had a funny queer look like he hadnt heard or couldnt an electric quiver trembled his body as his hand encircled her breast jesusss christ he mumbled pressing his body hard against her squeezing the jutting softness comon carrie mae loosen up ah know you done this before out in the bushes colored girl your age always has we both kin feel real fine together aint nobody gonna know nobody here but us nobody here he laughed easily thinking her surprise relief hell naw wife done took the kids with her yesditty ah got lonely out here in these woods by myself got to laying wake last night remembering how pretty the boys said you were damned if they didnt describe you to a t a frightened knowingness washed away all the silent questions besieging her panic flooded her rising through and up to her throat exposing itself in one raw cry no she beat against him attempting to break away what this white man wanted wasnt right even if he was white it wasnt right please suh let me go help shut up damnit cant nobody hear you no way shut up ah said his hand slapped her hard causing her head and senses to spin for a moment she leaned weakly against him fighting the foaming black dizziness then his hand felt downward between her legs shock ripped through her she lashed out bringing her knee up in a swift blow he grunted halfbending dropping his arms to grab himself when he did she broke away scrambling to the back door the door was locked panicstricken she turned quickly measuring the distance between him and the passage to the front door in a flash she streaked wildly by him knocking over the high chair pain stabbed her knees his arm shot out catching the back of her dress she gave a muffled animal cry as she broke from his grasp dress tearing in his hand she reached the front door frantically jerking it open comon back here ah said comon back she ran and ran and ran until the words were not even an echo    mama was sitting on the front porch when she reached the cabin breathlessly she stumbled up the steps falling at mamas feet and dropping her head in mamas lap chilechilewhats the matter she felt the large warm arms enfolding her and it seemed a long time until she could get her breath before she could tell when she finished mama kept saying nochillennochillen in a singsong kind of way suddenly like the devil had been let loose mama jumped up exclaiming loudly we going to the pollice billy ray ran from around the house looking questioningly at them pollice what for you going to the pollice mind your bizness billy ray mama retorted shoving him aside the boy slyly lowered his lashes at carrie mae did you git my candy carrie mae shut up boy mama said thats all you think about your stomick her eyes fell upon the girl again looking at her face bruised and swollen and at her feet blistered and powdered with dust angry pain flashed in her face lets go chile she said low put this safety pin back of your dress we going just like this and show the pollice what that man tried to do billy ray you stay here til sara gits home ah wanna go ah wanna go the boy screeched jumping up and down now you keep quiet ah said stay here whimpering the boy edged sulkily into the house the law ought to take care of him for sure mama mumbled why he want to be messin round with young girls mamas voice grew indistinct and carrie mae couldnt hear the rest as they started toward the road    a man in a pickup truck gave them a ride to town they tried to ignore his curious glances and outspoken what happened when mama asked to be let out at the courthouse wearily they began to climb the twenty narrow concrete steps to the big stone building housing the courthouse sheriffs office and jail there was a landing between the tenth and eleventh stepsa wide concrete platform supporting a statue of a confederate soldier a cool drinking fountain was in front of the soldier with a white only sign crudely printed attached to it they paused breathing heavily from the climb and heat beside the white only fountain mamas huge bosom rose and fell like a heaving wave then after a while she took hold of the girl and they began once again the climb the sheriff was moonfaced and needed a shave his obese form was sprawled carelessly behind a desk cluttered with papers pencils empty coke bottles and filled ash  trays a large poster was framed behind him showing an american flag waving in a blue background with big black letters printed on it reading liberty and justice for all the sheriff scared carrie mae the way his flabby jaws worked in monotonous rhythm as he chewed tobacco and the way his small eyes glared stonily unblinking at them but he didnt seem to scare mama when he growled yeah whatdoyouwant mama spoke right up so distressed that the words tumbled out ahead of each other all right all right auntie take your time he interrupted fumbling through papers now he squinted at an official looking form whats your name lillie henry suh where you live lillie just outside town on mista tom wrights land suh whats her name he asked glancing briefly at carrie mae carrie mae suh hummm the pen stopped its scratching sound leaving a brief silence between them now lillie he began again frowning you say a man tried to assault this girl suh mama asked puzzled by the way he chewed his words with the tobacco ah said you say a man tried to git at this girl he snapped impatiently mama looked at carrie mae who stood motionless with her head down thats right mista sheriff she replied leaning over the desk in her anxiety he said he wanted her to mind his chillen while his wifes away but his wife and chillen were gone werent nobody there but him all the time sure damn looks like somebody tried to do something he snorted laughing this nigger live in town mama stared gravely watching him playing with the pen this wasnt no cullurd man mista sheriff this was a white man the sheriffs jaws abruptly stopped their grinding leaving the small pink lips slightly ajar for the first time he looked directly at her you mean to stand there and tell me a whiite man tried to rape her mama nodded shaking her head emphatically thats right suh mista bust will he came but before she could finish the sheriffs voice rose harshly waitaminute he was standing now face fiery red his bulbous stomach breathing like a separate entity hanging over his belt aint no nigger coming in mah office with any old accusashon like that  aint a whiite man in this town whod even bother with any old nigger gal moving uncannily fast for his size he bridged the space around his desk with lightning speed trying to blame a niggers dirt on a whiite man now git outta mah office before ah put both your black asses in mah jail mama stood stark still mouth jarred loosely like she didnt understand or didnt want to understand what he was saying nigger he said dangerously even you hear what ah said clutching the girls hand mama moved out of the office feeling his eyes blazing through their backs hotter than the sun had been without a word they went dully down the twenty narrow concrete steps not pausing this time beside the confederate soldier and the white only fountain mamas hand squeezed painfully around hers like she was afraid the girl would disappear or like she needed something to hold on to bad they walked slowly through the town and on out to where the highway began oblivious to the town with its scattered knots of people and the ancient unmovable town scenes they were halfway down the road when the girl made a strangling sound and began to cry mama stopped and watched her face heavy and still the girls thin body shuddered as the sobs racked her body then after a long while ever so gently mama took her big apron and wiped the girls face hush chile hush she murmured softly aint no use in crying now aint no use the girl kept her face hidden in the aprons curtain smelling the aprons freshness and needing the aprons shelter finally the sobs subsided under the whispering kindness of the voice and the smooth familiar caress of the womans hand silent moments later mama pushed her gently away the girl watched her stare for a timeless eternity at the fading sky seeing mamas lips move ever so slightly like they did when she prayed in church on sunday then mamas hand reached for hers again and together they started slowly down the road home

we are all let us face it mississippians we all fervently wish that the negro problem did not exist or that if it must exist it could be ignored confronted with the howling need for decent schools jobs housing and all the other minimum rights of the american system we will do our best in a halfhearted way to correct old wrongs the hand may be extended grudgingly and patronizingly but anyone who rejects that hand rejects his own best interests for minimum rights are the only rights that we are willing to guarantee and above those minimum rights there is and will continue to be a vast area of discrimination and inequity and unfairness the area in which we claim the most basic right of allthe right to be stupid and prejudiced the right to make mistakes the right to be less and worse than we pretend the right to be ourselves when this majority right is threatened the majority will react accordinglywith results that could be disastrous to all of us from the editorial a new white backlash in the september   saturday evening post
black_power has claimed its first two victims they are vice president hubert humphrey and roy wilkins executive secretary of the naacp both men honored veterans of the civil_rights movement succumbed temporarily at least to the most ancient of maladies the inability to adjust to a new idea    we find nothing subversive in sncc chairman stokely carmichaels remarks on the contrary this type of thinking is both practical and traditionally american    nor should the older generation of civil_rights leaders object to the young negroes wanting to run their own show with white men supporting rather than dominating the various organizations this should be interpreted as a sign of maturity it means that negroes having won their le gal rights under the old system now are ready to work toward their goals under their own leadership like any other minority this too is traditional american history does not show that the irish were content to be led by yankees or that working men were content to be led by their employers    in short we are suggesting that the older generation of civil_rights leaders avoid the mistakes of hubert humphrey and roy wilkins and resist the urge to panic at the sound of black_power    we suggest that the older civil_rights generation reexamine this new concept of direct action and concentrate on the more thoughtful speeches of black_power advocates these young men are surprisingly realistic and are fully aware of both their caabilities and their limitations and ike it or not they are destined to be the doers of the new era of civil_rights whether they do good or evil depends in part on whether their predecessors encourage or repress themfrom the boston herald july  
the countrys newspaper proprietors the vast majority enjoying a monopoly preside over an institution that should be the most sensitive detector of change in society but among major american institutions newspapers have been the least responsive to upheavals in civilization since world war ii government education religion and much of corporate life have adapted to altered conditions in economic and social life but newspaper owners have clung to the past they seem to be reminded of their special status under the first amendment only when someone suggests changes in the secondclass mailing privilege or the payment of standard wages to delivery boys their response to the nation of the press being accountable to the public is to bar reporters from sessions of the american newspaper publishers association in addition the dangers of news monopoly are increasing   from houstons shackled press by ben h bagdikian in the august  atlantic	
behind the nondebate is a very real crisis in the movement which is more precisely a crisis in american life the dream of an integrated national community is about over all the dreamstuffthe assumptions about a mobile pluralistic egalitarian societyseems to be vanishing the country has responded to negro demands over the past decade primarily by eliminating the symbols of southern feudalism legal segregation disenfranchisement official brutality otherwise there have been few changes in american institutions the economy still excludes the underclass of poor negroes from productive employment    the naacp is the traditional home of the small negro middleclass its president is white and jewish its director roy wilkins is the grin on the democratic administrations civil_rights face he heads the official civil_rights lobby the leadership conference in washington vice president humphrey to nobodys surprise was the principal speaker at the naacp convention recently in los angeles and not surprisingly the naacp condemned black_power and reiterated its support for an integration strategy and why not the net result of the bloody demonstrations of poor negroes in the south has been benefits for middleclass negroes in the northandrew kopkind in new statesman july
