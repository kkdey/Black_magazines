an eightyear old negro a  girl flipped the pages £ of her new third y grade social studies book as she came to the last page she seemed puzzled she reread the books cover and began a more deliberate inspection of its contents after scanning the book a second time the littli girl raised her hand and asked her teacher where am  in this book undoubtedly a similar question has run across the minds of millions of nearo vounasters from whence have i come in americas history and who am i and where do i fit in american society this is not a new feeling seventysix years ago edward a johnson noted nearo historian and educator wrote of how    the little colored child feels when he has completed the assigned course of united states history and in it found not one word of credit not one word of favorable comment tor even one among the millions of his foreparents who have lived through nearly three centuries of his countrys history   the unfortunate and tragic fact is that generations of negro children have grown up with a warped attitude toward themselves their parents and grandparents inside the american classroom they have not found anything to give them a sense of dignity and selfworth they have searched vainly through pure white books for some positive recognition of their races contribution to the civilization of man outside the classroom these negro youngsters and their parents have been subjected to the severe hardships the unending frustrations and humiliations of discrimination and segregation they have become a people robbed of their rich history and culture by historians through omissions neglect and the perputation of racial stereotypes and myths this has been a great american tragedy we have no way of knowing how many negro youths have become frustrated discouraged and bitter over their feeling of nobodyness we have no way of knowing how many potential negro scientists scholars doctors teachers and businessmen have been swept into the ditch of oblivion by the psychological backlash from the negro history gap dr charles h wesley educator author and historian who cur rently serves as executive director of the association for the study of negro life and history has written    history is not the story of men and women of one race or color and the neglect and omission of the men and women of another race and color it is neither the glorification of white people nor black people but it is the story of people irrespective of race or color it should deal with people in all times and places and should present the contribution of all the people to civilization when a part of the people has been neglected or given subordinate places history in order to be truthful must be reconstructed  i agree with dr wesley let us reconstruct american history as it really happened let the full facts be known the real story told of the remarkable contributions of negroes to americas growth and greatness let all our children negro and white learn the complete history of our country let them learn that negroes were here as far back as the days when columbus discovered the western hemisphere that negroes accompanied the spanish and portuguese explorers of the new world  negroes were among the  settlers who founded los angeles explorer jean baptiste point du sable a frencheducated negro trader founded our countrys second citychicago in  surveyor benjamin banneker helped major pierre p enfant plan and lay out the city of washington inventor elijah mccoy devised the selflubricating machine matthew henson was the first man to set foot on the north pole minutes ahead of his chief admiral perry let our boys and girls learn about slavepoetess phillis wheatley who began the tradition of negro literature in america about frederick douglass a great american orator and statesman who played a significant role in the outcome of the civil war let the education of both youths and adults include proper recognition of the nameless black masses whose toil helped build american cities let all of us understand and appreciate the true role of the negro in this countrys struggle for freedom and justice let every american know that the very first man to lose his life in the cause of american independence was crispus attucks shot down by the british in the boston massacre of     five thousand negroes fought in the forces of general george washington in our war for independence  gave their lives to the north from among  in the union armies and navy    negro troops charged up san juan hill with teddy roosevelts rough riders they fought and died for their country in world wars i and ii throughout the truth of negro history runs a nobility in the face of adversity an epic faith over pain and travail a courage which exalts character the negros past is americas past as is his present and future he is an integral part of the warp and woof of the varied american fabric america has made a start in closing its history gao but much work remains to be done in recent years boards of edu m cation have written and published their own supplementary texts on negro history some textbook publishers have revised and updated their materials on the negro in american history professional organizations in recent months have sponsored national conferences on the treatment of minorities in textbooks this is a good beginning all segments of our society must work together in bridging our history gap for the shared pride in negro history and achievement is a solid foundation upon which to build a new and healthy climate of mutual respect and understanding among all elements of society in the words of frederick douglass this is a time when the american people are once more being urged to do from necessity what they should have done from a sense of right and of sound w  statesmanship   
arter g woodc son was always so full of new ideas that he had no need to repeat himself yet on many occasionsespecially at the saturday sessions of the annual meeting of the association for the study of negro life and history when school teachers were present he would make a statement that went something like this it will be a great day for the association and for the study of american history when it will no longer be necessary to direct special attention to the fact that the negro has always been a part of american history he would then go on to say that the purpose of negro history week was to promote the history negro to the history week longer be necessary year in and year out dr woodson worked diligently to promote a new american history that would reject the notion that the negro had no history or that he should be treated in some special way no one was a more vigorous protagonist of the idea that the history of the united states should be completely integrated no one did more to point out the fallacies and inaccuracies of works in history assumed that the negro had no place in such works no single person did more to promote a new american historya democratic equalitarian american historyas far as racial and ethnic groups are concerned happily dr woodson lived long enough to witness the feeble beginnings of a new american history that accepted his ideas and premises but his wildest dreamsand he did dreamcould not have visualized what would happen in this area in the  years following his death today heightened interest on the part of americans in discovering a new and more accurate place for the negro in american life and history is the result of the operation of a number of factors and forces it was interestingly enough stimulated by the legal fight for equality that began in earnest during the postwar years in  the united states supreme court drew attention to the question of the history of the negro in american life by inquiring into the intent of the framers of the fourteenth amendment did they intend that the amendment should prevent segregated schools and other forms of segregation immediately lawyers and their consultants in the field of history scurried to the libraries and archives and began to pen lengthy and learned treatises on the activities of negroes during the reconstruction the programs and motives of their protagonists and the abortions performed on the fourteenth amendment by its wouldbe subverted it was a part of the general search for a broader and deeper meaning of the american experience brought on in part by the wartime effort to articulate a democratic ideology and in part by the postwar search for moral stability the search sent historians in a dozen different directions and they wrote on such diverse subjects as the american political tradition the image of man in america and faith of our fathers one historian emphasizing the transitory nature of some of our institutions and the recency of some others argued successfully that the legal institution of segregation was not nearly as old as the myth would have us believe perhaps most of all the search for a new american history was a direct consequence of the generationlong persistence of woodson his associates and the slowly increasing number of adherents to the view that american history as it had been taught and written in the past was tragically and deplorably incomplete thus it was not unlike the history of the civil_rights movement of a later date those who came to embrace the civil_rights movement did not invent it although some thought they did they merely discovered it those who began to think about american history and write about it in a new dimension did not invent it although some thought they did they merely discovered it as they searched among the heap of revisionist historical writings and suggestions for new approaches that had been ignored and disregarded for many years by the main body of american historians it was a most rewarding discovery made even more rewarding by a new willingness to discover new truths even if it called for a revision of longheld highly regarded views it made possible a new appraisal of ancient african cultures for which dr woodson had called in his african background outlined it facilitated a new look at the conditions among negroes before the civil war which dr woodson had helped to illuminate in his education of the negro prior to  a score of other areas came to the attention of those who sought to fill the gaps in the history of american life the role of negroes during the civil war the complex relationships of freedom to the social order during reconstruction the intellectual response of negroes to postreconstruction degradation and the economic and political meaning of the color line in the twentieth century the veritable spate of books and articles that have come from the writers of the new american history in the past  years has inevitably resulted in the massing of a great body of new facts and the projection of many new interpretations but the discovery has only just begun anyone familiar with the old american history knows all too well that we must yet fill innumerable gaps about such matters as the colonial negro the  negro artisan the negro abolitionist the negro in the early days of organized labor and even the negro in congress but it is equally clear that the logjam created by silence or distortion has been broken and that in time more gaps will be filled they will be filled by those who present the results of their diligent research at the annual meetings of the association for the study of negro life and history the southern historical association the american historical association the organization of american historians and numerous other historical societies it seems almost unnecessary to remark that all historical activities today do not necessarily contribute to the new american history some historians whose writings reflect both diligence and zeal resist new interpretations with a vigor that is similar to the vigor of those in other areas who seek to keep inviolate the old order others more subtle and if i may say so more sinister work assiduously to discover new materials only to use them to reflect unfavorably on the very idea of a new american history still others opportunists pure and simple and frequently merely pseudohistorians at best seize the opportunity presented by a more congenial climate to write  or more properly to slap together somethinganythingon the negro these opportunists see the ready market and they would not miss it for the world their interest is not new american history but new american dollars one can only say that the reader nay the buyer beware neither the antagonists nor the opportunists can stem the tide that has set in although they can perhaps delay it or subvert it we move nevertheless inexorably toward a condition in our study of american history where it is possible to reexamine the total american past and on the basis of that reexamination we can write a new synthesis of the american experience this is not to imply that such a work should have an air of finality about it indeed it would be better if it emphasized the tentative nature of its findings and interpretations for example we already know a great deal about reconstruction we know that the night was not as long or as dark as we have been told and we can prove it but we yet have much to learn about what actually happened during the socalled night of reconstruction and we have much to learn about who kept it from being so dark or so long and how they did it in other words the very spirit of the new american history is one of revisionism and one of the most important things that the revisionist spirit does is to recognize the possibility of further modification as well as greater precision and refinement even when the materials are readily available the writing of a new american history is no easy task first of all it calls on the writer to make certain assumptions that are in keeping with the underlying forces in american history among them is the assumption that american history is not the success story of white anglosaxon protestants who as the story goes made this country strong and great against all odds rather the history of the united states is the story of a joint enterprise with various groups and individuals playing certain roles either taken by them or assigned to them the roles they have played however exalted or however humble have been important in the making of america secondly it rejects the notion that the history of the united states is merely an exercise to inspire blind loyalty and patriotism this is not to say that the new american history should set out to undermine devotion to country that would be a tragic mistake it is to say however that a healthy devotion to country must rest on a clear understanding of what actually happened and not on some fantasy of what should have happened any american history worth writing or worth studying recognizes the fact that this land was peopled from the beginning with ordinary human beingsvery fallible human beings they made mistakes many mistakes and they were wrongheaded in many ways it is unfortunate that the colonists did not want negroes in the continental army but the fact is that they did not it is a sad commentary on the use of the natural rights philosophy that the continental congress would not permit the condemnation of slavery in the declaration of independence but the fact is that it would not it is tragic that for more than  years the united states would not recognize haiti because it was a black nation but that is an undeniable fact it is not pleasant to discover that the entire american experience is suffused with certain doctrines of racism that have at times been decisive in determining the course of american history but who can deny this after studying the history of the ideology of white supremacy in the united states that has justified slavery segregation discrimination and degradation the lesson that the new american history teaches is that only by a critical realistic appraisal of the past can we understand the roots of the difficulties that plague the nation today otherwise we will be like the master who in describing his runaway slave as one with whelps and gashes on his back then commented sardonically that he could not possibly understand why the slave ran away it should be added that the new american history requires a sense  of balance and proportion that may be easily upset by the zeal that comes from the effort to redress the balance in reassessing the negros role in american history to give an absurd example one must not insist that crispus attucks was the central figure in the war of independence he died five years before it began in restating the negros valiant resistance to slavery one must not insist that every slaveowner had his brutus or his nat turner it is well to remember that most slaveowners had one or two slaves and they were in no position to mount a large scale conspiracy it is indeed remarkable if a given generation of oppressed restrained degraded people cc produce one nat turner it derstandable that some  inose who have suffered from centuries of almost complete omission from the nations history should now insist on converting the history of the united states largely into a history of the negro people but the new american history cannot answer the call either for preferential treatment as is advocated in the argument for greater job opportunities for negroes or for proportional representation as if history could be allocated to people in the way that congressional districts are arranged happily there are now some historians who on the basis of preparation understanding and temperament are prepared to write the new american history but we can derive no great satisfaction from that fact for the numbers are not large and we still desperately need more such historians we need more of those who will search out the still undisclosed facts that will illuminate every page of the history of this country and we need historians who will provide new works for every level of understanding it is not enough that the new american history should be revealed in the pages of the learned journals or even in the college textbooks many of which are still merely warmedover versions of the old history the new american history must become a part of the curriculum of our schools the need for a new history in the elementary grades and in the eighth and eleventh grades is at least as great as the need for a new mathematics or a new biology i hasten to add that the new american history requires still other qualities of the historian namely commitment determination and courage while the parents and others may accept the new math merely because they are mesmerized by its mysteries many of them will not take the new history without a fight they confidently feel that they know the history of their country and the uses to which history should be put unaccustomed as they are to revisionism or indeed to any innovations they will resist change with a fierceness that will frighten the fainthearted and with a zeal that will defeat the uncommitted for example one must not be surprised if management is outraged by any suggestion that selfishness has been a motivating force in the conduct of american business or if labors feelings are hurt by a description of racial discrimination in the unions one must be prepared to hear patriotic mothers expressing distress if the new history has no picture of betsy ross making the first american flag and isolationists decrying any reference to the united nations and one must realize that ethnic and minority groups will have axes to grind such as negroes weeping if the recently discovered negro cowboys do not receive equal treatment in the story of the winning of the west the forces resisting the new american history have great influence and are in many instances wellorganized a member of a school board in a great american city has declared that as long as one of the new history books has a certain statement in it she will  mock its use in the schools of that city the statement is a quotation from president lincolns speech to the negroes of richmond in which one of his listeners reported him as having said let me say god has made you free although you have been deprived of your godgiven rights by your socalled masters you are now as free as i am and if those that claim to be your superiors do not know that you are free take the sword and bayonet and teach them that you are free    for god created all men free giving to each the same rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness one wonders what the board members reaction would have been if instead of using the  richmond quotation the historian had used the  peoria quotation in which lincoln said that he did not believe in the social and political equality of whites and negroes the ingenuity as well as the resources of the opponents of the new american history may be regarded as virtually limitless in one state where a new history book has been under consideration it has  been condemned as one that is designed to give a white child a sense of guilt because it has an entire chapter on slavery and because there is a drawing of a negro child in  looking rather wistfully at a group of white children playing on a school ground opponents have demanded that the  drawing be omitted or that it be  redrawn to include the negro child at play with the white children it is indeed easier to redraw the picture than to integrate the schools of south carolina in  or in  the book has been condemned as polemical because it presents a chart showing that school desegregation has progressed at a snails pace it is true that a new day has dawned for the new american history it enjoys a congenial climate and it flourishes in some places but if one seeks merely to promote the study of historyany history in the united states the line of least resistance still is to write the old history that offends no one except history itself and those who have no place in it but we cannot take that line any more than we can desert the larger struggle for equality for the new american history is in a real sense a part of the struggle to achieve dignity and equality in american life if any among us ever fancied ourselves as resting safely in the ivory tower of learning alienated from life itself then we should retreat to the security of the old history but if we regard ourselves as fighters for freedom and equality we need not go far to find the battleground the opponentsthe defenders of the old order and the old historylie in wait and the battleground is at the very place where we take up our pens and do battle for a new truthseeking democratic american history
in our a number of mean something country we celebrate nationwide holidays like george washingtons birthday but we also have historic days which primarily to a particular group or which are celebrated in only one state or region it is not surprising that the negro a longtime american would have his quota of special days to remember it is to be noted too that these negro history holidays were dates on which something had taken place not locally but on the national or international scene the first of these historic days is a case in pointmarch   this was the boston massacre in which the british soldiers shot and killed five civilians one of these was crispus attucks a mulatto the first to die the boston massacre would not be forgottenthe colonial patriots would see to that its anniversary was duly observed each year in a public ceremony bells would toll during the day and in the evening a leading citizen would deliver a stirring address against british tyranny the boston massacre marked the dawn of the american revolution but in  with the coming of the fourth of july it fell into disuse as a holiday it was resurrected by boston negroes in  as a protest against the dred scott decision appropriately enough the meeting place of the commemorative exercises was faneuil hall from which attucks had been buried and the speaker was the abolitionist orator wendell phillips thirty years later in  the dream of the boston negroes was realized when the state legislature and the city council appropriated  for the erection of a crispus attucks monument to be placed on the boston common in the occurrence which we commemorate the colored race has a profound interest for one of that race was the principal figure in it said william h dupree negro chairman of the citizens committee as he opened the exercises boston negroes of a later generation would succeed in having governors of the state officially proclaim march  as crispus attucks day another date dear to negroes of a bygone century was august  west india emancipation day when in  an act of parliament abolishing slavery in englands island possessions went into effect negroes and their abolitionist supporters were not enthusiastic about our own fourth of july believing it a mockery to celebrate american independence and freedom as long as slavery existed in our country they found a satisfying substitute in august  it was a date of vast significance to us wrote peter h clark of cincinnati it was the morning star heralding the rise of the sun of our liberty in many instances negroes celebrated august  in company with whites for racial intermingling in a friendly and relaxed setting no affair could touch an august  picnic in some instances negroes held celebrations all their own this was particularly true after the civil war whites ceasing to mark the day once american slavery had ended negroes however continued to welcome all who might wish to come to the celebration in topeka kansas in  they extended an earnest invitation to all freedom loving white persons to turn out with us on that occasion the august  anniversaries naturally struck a serious note with a sermon and an address often climaxed by an original poem by someone like frances e w harper or j m whitfield but coming in midsummer an august  celebration was sometimes held in a shady grove thus becoming something of a picnic in fact if not in name the proceedings might be enlivened by games of dexterity and stunts and perhaps a band concert a military drill a fireworks display or even a balloon ascension in the cities the day might be ended by a formal dance or by a concert by someone like elizabeth greenfield the black swan in san francisco in  the sponsors of the celebration advised potential customers not to worry about how to get home assuring them that the horse cars will run all night with the coming of the twentieth century the august  celebrations tended to become fewer being observed mainly by negroes who had come from the west indies the civil war years brought two of the negros historic holidays both of them slaveemancipating occasions the first of these was april   when the  slaves in the district of columbia were set free by an act of congress lifting their voices in joy and thanksgiving negroes from coast to coast held a series of  celebration meetings if we rejoice and give thanks to the almighty wrote the editor of the angloafrican we rejoice less as black men than as part and parcel of the american people for it is clearly a great boon to the nation at large than to the class more immediately concerned however the subsequent observance of april  was almost exclusively left in the hands of the negro understandably too it gradually became a district of columbia affair primarily generally the april  celebrations took the form of a street parade followed by a formal speech indoors led by a squad of mounted police the parade was usually directed by christian a fleetwood a congressional medal winner for heroism in the civil war companies of the national guard benevolent societies and fraternal organizations made up the line of march generally the procession halted before the home of senator charles sumner while the band played auld lang syne then the paraders went to a hall or a church for a twohour address by the speaker of the day often this would be the peerless frederick douglass a resident of the district with his death in  the celebration lost something it never regained the second of the slaveemancipating occasions celebrated by negroes was the day of jubilee itselfjanuary   the day when president lincoln declared free the slaves in the rebellious states negroes could scarcely contain themselves over the good news throughout the country there were proclamation meetings all of them the scenes of joyous excitement the most glorious day this nation has ever seen wrote the young schoolteacher charlotte forten in her diary certainly it was the greatest day in the history of the negro american its annual observance became an honored tradition the historian frenise a logan describes a typical emancipation day celebration in the towns throughout north carolina replete with brass band a negro militia company a negro fire company and several social organizations negroes would march through the principal streets to the courthouse here the procession would gather to  hear the reading of the emancipation proclamation followed by an address from a prominent negro or a sympathetic white man but for all its importance emancipation day came at a season when the weather was likely to be cold and blustery hence some negroes preferred september  as slaveemancipation day it was on this date in  that lincoln issued his preliminary proclamation declaring that if the rebel states did not lay down their arms by january  he would declare their slaves free but as a historic holiday september  despite its more favorable position on the  calendar never really rivalled january  after  the latter itself lost some of its popular appeal tending to become an indoors affair even in the warmer climates with the negro churches as its chief sponsor out of the freeing of the slaves came some of the negro holidays restricted to one state on july   nev york negroes inaugurated the annual observance of the abolition of slavery in their state in  the negroes in texas launched the yearly celebration of june juneteenththe day on which slavery there came to its end during the hopeful years after the civil war the negro people warmed up the fourth of july now that slavery was gone they felt that they could celebrate independence day without mixed emotions certainly if anyone had a right to celebrate the fourth it was the negro the return of the festival of our national independence wrote john greenleaf whittier in  has called our attention to a matter which has been carefully kept out of sight by orators and toastdrinkers we allude to the participation of colored men in the great struggle for american freedom negroes had always wished to unite with other americans in observing the glorious fourth indeed as if in anticipation the young men of the banneker institute in philadelphia held an independence day celebration at franklin hall in  a brass and string band played several national airs opening with hail columbia the orator of the day william h johnson asserted that the declaration of independence included black men as well as white men and that it encourages us to live and labor zealously for our rights here in america johnsons words seemed to come true in  when the fifteenth amendment was ratified sometimes referred to as the keystone of reconstruction this measure sought to protect the negro at the polls the day of ratification was march  and it marked another day to be encircled in the negros calendar in some cities negro women wore shawls of red white and blue at a ratification celebration held in baltimore more than  negroes marched through the streets we have a future everything is possible to us said one of the speakers ratification day did indeed seem to have a future some negroes preferred it to emancipation day on the grounds that lincolns proclamation benefited the slave whereas the fifteenth amendment benefited all negroes and it was true that the amendment was ad vantageous to the negro whether north or south its sponsors definitely having in mind the negro vote in the north but the march  observances petered out within a decade baltimore holding one of the last of them in  by then the southern negro was fast losing the ballot and the bright promises of reconstruction were fading hence it is not surprising that a civil_rights act passed in  gave rise to no new negro holiday it was just as well eight years later in  the supreme court ruled that the act was illegal the day this decision was handed down was a gloomy one for negroes a day not unlike that on which john brown was hanged or lincoln was shot in the twentieth century perhaps the nearest thing to a nationwide negro history holiday would be may   when the supreme court ruled that public school segregation was contrary to the constitution but since world war ii there have been many breakthroughs and firsts on the race relations front with so many things happening no single date could take on standout proportions in taking a final glance at the negro redletter days it is to be noted that all of them celebrate some aspect of freedom this is their significance and their essential americanism for what is it that makes the united states a nation not a common ancestry and not a history stretching back into legendary times our nationhood is based upon our commitment to the ideas of liberty and equality these are the twin goals which negro americans have expounded and for which so many have put their lives on the line and the holidays which they have held in highest esteem were those which marked a milestone in their countrys journey along freedom road 
contrary to the beliefs of all too many scholars relatively large numbers of negro americans have for centuries identified with africa this identification has been reflected in backtoafrica movements missionary efforts historicalcultural references and what i here refer to as the rhetoric of african recognitionthat is the accept ance and affirmation of ones african origins the major focus of this paper is on w e b du bois and to a lesser extent carter woodson two of this centurys leading advocates of african consciousness among negro americans these men however were not alone in their concern with african history and culture othersmartin delaney and alexander crummell during the th century bruce and schomburg during the th to name a fewspent much of their lives in search of the african past though the latter two were not as well equipped by training to unravel what was at best a conundrum for most americans in the early part of the century their views are nevertheless mentioned for both men played significant roles in promoting the study of african history and culture it is beyond the scope of this paper to attempt an exposition and interpretation of the full corpus of thought on africa entertained by du bois and woodson my purpose is to present the most salient views of du bois and woodson on africa and test them at certain critical points against the findings of modern scholarship in the process i hope to determine the extent to which these men provided a better understanding of the history of africa moreover i shall present the views of du bois and woodson against that backdrop of african consciousness among many negroes which persisted despite efforts at repression over the centuries with respect to du bois writings on the psyches of persons of african descent i want to suggest through the introduction of fairly representative examples of his thinking on the subject an analogy between his views and the negritude schools of thought finally i have not entered into a discussion of either the garvey movement or the new negro movement but certainly a more complete treatment of the conflict between garvey and du bois over the african question is much needed and long overdue and an examination of the artistic views held by du bois visavis poets like langston hughes claude mckay and countee cullen would certainly throw into sharper relief the particular variant of negritude espoused by du bois
however terrible the shocks through which slaves went before and after their arrival in americatraumas which p doubtless in time erased practically all memories of the an cestral home from the minds of these black mensome articulate ones among the race throughout the centuries identified with africa in making this identification they probably spoke for a large segment of the inarticulate masses benjamin banneker writing at a time when mockery was made of the negros color and ancestral home wrote to thomas jefferson in  that he freely and cheerfully acknowledged the fact that he was of the african race and in that color which is natural to them of the deepest dye forty years later david walker in his militant appeal urged the slaves to revolt exclaiming if any are anxious to ascertain who i am know the world that i am one of the oppressed degraded and wretched sons of africa rendered so by the avaricious and unmerciful among the whites  between bannekers letter and walkers appeal an event took place which probably had much to do with the way many th century negroes were later to view africain  the american colonization society was founded for the purpose of transporting all free negroes back to africa st clair drake has observed drake is probably correct in his theory that after the formation of the american colonization society many negroes tended to eschew use of the word african and opt for colored nevertheless the use of the word african was much in evidence throughout the th century having frequently been used by negro abolitionists and intellectualsnotably henry h garnett and alexander crummelland reconstruction leaders such as richard cain and bishop henry m turner indeed these men not only frequently referred to negroes as africans but made a more significant identification with africa by advocating at one time or another emigration to africa in this regard crummell and turner had lasting influence identification with africa at the turn of the century seemed to be as it had been during earlier periods closely related to how negroes were faring in america during the s increasingly large numbers of negroes became disenchanted with race relations and either looked to africa or to central america as a place of refugein much the same way that embattled jews have looked to israel in our time the harsh decades from  to  doubtless contributed to the efficacy of bishop turners back to africa movement and to the growth of african consciousness along historical lines by the close of the century unquestionably as the lines of race hardened in the opening years of the century august meier has written there was an increasing tendency to use negro history to foster race pride and group solidarity as the basis of advancement by collective action and as an antidote to prejudice and discrimination as an expression of this growing interest in the heritage of people of african descent there was a veritable proliferation of negro history groups prominent among such groups were the american negro historical society of philadelphia  the negro society for historical research  and the association for the study of negro life and history  it should be recalled that the influence of social darwinism was not inconsiderable in america during the last quarter of the th century and the early decades of the th century the period during which negroes were becoming increasingly interested in their history glorifiers of the anglosaxon race sat in some of the most important seats of learning propounding the thesis that only the teutonic nations were able to maintain states in which freedom could flourish james k hosmer short history of anglosaxon freedom  and john w burgess political science and comparative constitutional law  celebrated the anglosaxon virtues and sought to establish the view that government of the people and by the people is of ancient anglosaxon origin rejecting the notion that africans and asians could govern themselves hosmer concluded that the inevitable issue is to be that ft the primacy of the world will lie with us english institutions english speech english thought are to become the main features of the political social and intellectual life of mankind people of color to be sure were unfit and not likely to survive but the traducers of people of african descent in the western world had long been active drake has written thus a formidable task lay ahead for those who would attempt to establish the negros humanity by reclaiming his heritage for the heritage of negroesslave as well as africanhad been systematically scored for centuries while it would be easier for negro scholars and writers to demonstrate negro achievement in americanell william wells brown and george washington williams had long since documented negro achievements from the colonial period to the civil war the job of discovering african achievement would for a number of reasons be much more formidable for one thing previous identification with africa among th century negroes had taken in the main missionary or emigrationist lines for another european expansion into africa during the th century had been attended by considerable antiafrican propaganda this expansion according to drake came at a period when the coincidence of certain factors made an extremely derogatory appraisal of africa almost inevitable among these factors were the tide of humanitarian sentiment the theory of the survival of the fittest the movement to set out to save africa for christ  the attempt to partition africa and break native resistance and the rapid increase of literacy which laid the base for a penny press selling sensationalism the members of the various american negro historical associations were not unmindful of this propaganda they like other american negroes growing up in the early part of the twentieth century probably heard of africa in church when ministers appealed for financial aid to support missionary work in africa the president of the negro society for historical research john edward bruce in some ways anticipating cheikh anta diop declared that the history of whites prior to  b c was a monumental fraud a total blank the white man stole his alphabet and derived his knowledge of science and religion from ancient african civilization which bore more than favorable comparison in many respects to modern europe the secretary of the society arthur a schomburg urged negroes to learn arabic because much of our life is undoubtedly wrapped up in the history customs and traditions of africa negro history should be taught in the public schools because it is the season for us to devote our time to kindling the torches that will inspire us to racial integrity the most impressive and scholarly work done by negroes to recover the african past and instill pride in negroes however was done by carter woodson and w e b du bois though both were better equipped by training than men like bruce and schomburg there was no question that they were out to prove through the application of science to history the essential humanity of people of african descent  this desire led both men to attack negro stereotypes born of the slave experience as well as those more directly related to europan expansion into africa at the close of the th century as one of the first negro scholars thoroughly grounded in the scientific method of handling historical materials carter woodson was a leader in the effort to present a more faithful representation of the negros past it might be said that his concern over the harm being done to the american negros psyche by racist propaganda led him to explore the african roots of that past l d reddick writing in crisis has described the forces which led woodson to realize the need for a racial revision of the writing of the history of people of african descent woodson saw clearly what american culture was doing to the psyche of the negro racist elements were strong whether one looked at literature newspapers science or social science historically most of the nations scientists social as well as naturalhad gone along with the theory that the negro was a more animallike physical type and definitely inferior mentally actually the whole context of this consideration was subjective yet to the man in the street the words of an eminent biologist anthropologist or psychologist meant scientific proof  it was this scientific proof that woodson set out to challenge in his most noted work the negro in our history he devotes four chapters to african history and one to african art writing in  a time in which few american historians evinced an interest in african history woodson discusses among other things the geography of africa the myth of african inferiority and the misrepresentation of travelers public functionaries and missionaries in africa concerning the missionaries he reports that among a few there was some tendency toward fairmindedness and an attempt to rise unto an appreciation of the africans contribution to civilization many of them however use exaggerating language contradicting themselves in praising africans in one place and denouncing them in another the missionarys account of the african cannot in the main be relied on for it would be unwise to expect that the partisans of a particular religion seeking to uproot another can be depended upon to report definitely on the virtues of the people whom they would proselyte woodson observed that if the missionary had a good impression of the natives religion and morals he would necessarily be disqualified for missionary effort he argues that the books written by most of these missionaries therefore are largely worthless in arriving at an appreciation of african culture  implicit in woodsons criticism of the accounts of travelers public functionaries and missionaries was his own deep appreciation of african civilization he believed that black africans had not only distinguished themselves in developing and maintaining empires of the stature of ghana mali and songhay but were in large measure responsible for the birth of egyptian civilization for carter woodson history seems to indicate that that country egypt was first settled by a negro tribe that mingled later with mediterranean people coming from the north egypt was the land of mixed breed or persons comparable to negroes passing in america onethird of the egyptians in his view were distinctly black woodson based much of his thinking on black african influence in egypt on the works of the distinguished anthropologist franz boas particularly boas the mind of primitive man and leo frobenius the voice of africa though railed at by many who thought he was making too much of black african achievements woodsons insistence that egypt was greatly influenced by black africa has since been corroborated by many distinguished africanists notably basil davidson and immanuel wallerstein to be sure few serious students of africa today deny this influence though there is some disagreement as to the extent of black african participation in the construction of egyptian civilization carter woodson devoted considerable attention to african empires in his writings this was especially true as regards his treatment of ghana more than any other american says rayford logan woodson    made known the medieval kingdom of ghana so that it evoked real meaning when the gold coast became selfgoverning on march    his the african background outlined according to melville j herskovits represented a serious attempt to comprehend the entire picture of the negro african and new world in its historical and functional setting woodsons discussion of african institutions does not for the most part vary significantly from what anthropologists such as herskovits have subsequently written concerning traditional african life and customs he clearly demonstrated that there was nothing simple and backward about the organization of african societies with respect to the training of children the conception of religion the morals of the people and the forms of political organization and woodson fully realized the need for american negroes to understand and appreciate these aspects of the african past for as herskovits has remarked concerning this matter no group in the population of this country has been more completely convinced of the inferior nature of the african background than have the negroes woodson speaking of general reactions among negroes framed the problem in  in these terms  just as woodson detected africanisms in american negro religious practices so did he view new world negro artistic expression as being under the strong influence of africa which was in his view the natural setting indeed woodson held to a view of the negro much like that held by later proponents of negritude it is generally agreed now he wrote that the negro has more of a spiritual makeup than other races he has not permitted his mind wholly to dominate his body he feels things deeply and he can express them emotionally the negros art could be explained by his temperament or his natural gifts
no one else popularized interest in africa among american negroes as much as woodson he could number scholars and large segments of the negro people among his followers the interest in africa inspired by woodson was accomplished through the annual meetings of the association for the study of negro life and history which he headed through his negro history week celebrations which he began promoting in  and through the pages of the journal of negro history in addition to the meetings of the association and negro history week as vehicles for imparting information on africa was the negro in our history a book which had gone through eight printings by the end of world war ii though undistinguished in style and organization this book as rayford w logan pointed out in  conveyed to more persons white and black pertinent information about the negro than has any other single volume in the year carter woodson established the association for the study of negro life and history the home university library brought out w e b du bois slim little volume the negro if woodson had a greater impact on american negroes in the promotion of african history du bois influence on africans and the american academic community was destined to be far greater very early in his life while but a child on his greatgrandmothers knee he had had his first introduction to africa it is of no small significance that his introduction was cultural with africa i had only one direct cultural connection and that was the african melody which my greatgrandmother used to sing where she learned it i do not know perhaps she herself was born in africa or had it of a mother or father stolen and transported but at any rate coming to the valleys of the hudson and housatonic black little and lithe she shivered and shrank in the harsh north winds looked longingly at the hills and often crooned a heathen melody to the child between her knees thus do bana coba gene me gene me do bana coba gene me gene me ben dnuli nuli null ben dle if the significance of this strange music did not surface upon the consciousness of du bois until later his african racial feeling came exclusively from his later learning and reaction his recoil from the assumptions of the whites and his experience in the south and at fisk he felt himself african by race  an integral member of the group of dark americans who were called negroes by the time he entered harvard in  du bois largely due to his experiences at fisk university had already developed an interest in negro american culture much superior to that of most negro students so close were africans and negroes linked together in his mind that he chose for his harvard commencement address the topic jefferson davis and the african which was later changed to jefferson davis as a representative of civilization in his masters thesisthe suppression of the slave tradeafrica and the american negro were again linked this study was published in the annual report of the american historical association as the enforcement of the slave trade laws the first of the major du bois historical works which earned for him the title of historian was through the publication of the volume the suppression of the african slave trade to the united states of america  in partial fulfillment for the degree of doctor of philosophy awarded in  at harvard university du bois was  years of age when he worked on this subject there were  chapters and appendices embracing colonist and state legislation and typical slave trade cases in  pages with voluminous footnotes and a bibliography the study won a place as the first volume of the harvard historical series daniel p mannix and malcolm cowley remark in black cargoes that the suppression of the african slave trade has not been superseded as an account of the political struggles over the trade  du bois based the study on national and state historical sources colonial statutes congressional documents personal narratives and reports of antislavery societies reviews of the book in the american historical review  the english historical review  the annals of the american academy  the atlantic monthly  and the nation  were on the whole quite favorable at this point in his intellectual development du bois had not evinced a serious interest in african history as such while at harvard albert bushnell hart had directed his attention to the history of the negro but there was at harvard at that time little knowledge of or interest in the history of africa four years prior to the publication of his doctoral dissertation however du bois had resolved to make a name in science to make a name in literature and thus to raise my race this decision before long led him to deepen his interest in africa by  du bois was in london writing the resolutions for the first panafrican conference in an address written for the occasion du bois identified those present as men and women of african blood and declared that the history of the world both ancient and modern has given many instances of no despicable ability and capacity among the blackest races of men  du bois called for the cessation of sacrificing african natives to the greed of gold cautioned against robbing them of their liberties debauching their family life and repressing their aspirations he spoke of the ruthless economic exploitation and political downfall of less developed nations and called on britain germany and france to look to the best in their traditions and promote progress and prosperity in their colonies the identification of negro american and african which du bois earlier had made an integral part of his thinking was expressed on the political plane in a passage which brought together people of african descent throughout the world let the nations of the world respect the integrity and independence of the free negro states of abyssinia liberia haiti and the rest and let the inhabitants of these states the independent tribes of africa the negroes of the west indies and america and the black subjects of all nations take courage strive ceaselessly and fight bravely that they may prove to the world their incontestible right to be counted among the great brotherhood of mankind  his championing of panafricanism dates from that address which followed by  years the congress of berlin at a time when practically the whole of africa was under european domination du bois was affirming the essential humanity of africans and calling for an end to the exploitation of that continent but it would not be until some  years later that he would attempt to set forth the contributions to world history of the blackest races of men in  franz boas spoke at atlanta university du bois was never the same after hearing the words of the great anthropologist it was boas who brought the history of africa to his attention few today are interested in negro history because they feel the matter settled the negro has no history  i remember my own sudden awakening from the paralysis of this judgment taught me in high school and in two of the worlds great universities franz boas came to atlanta university where i was teaching history in  and said to a graduating class you need not be ashamed of your african past and then he recounted the history of the black kingdom of the sahara for a thousand years i was too astonished to speak all of this i had never heard and  came then and afterwards to realize how the silence and neglect of science can let truth utterly disappear or even be unconsciously distorted nine years later the home university library published du bois the negro a book devoted largely to african history including chapters on ethiopia and egypt african culture the slave trade and the west coast of africa the book was in many ways up to that time the most impressive one written by an american in the field of african history writing in the preface to the book du bois pointed out that the time has not yet come for a complete history of the negro peoples noting the fact that archaeological research had just begun in africa du bois contended that racial prejudice against darker peoples was too strong in socalled civilized centers for judicial appraisement of africa dr du bois essayed to present such short general statement of the main known facts and their fair interpretation as shall enable the general reader to know as men a sixth or more of the human race  the negro was of interest to the scholar as well as to the general reader small in size but large in quality the book utilizes the theories of franz boas and guiseppi sergi additional writers on whom du bois relied in varying degrees were ibn batuta leo africanus leo frobenius h barth w d cooley lady lugard and e w blyden to name a few most africanists today will probably not subscribe to du bois viewborrowed from boasthat black african people were the first to smelt iron but his assertion that egypt was influenced by black africans is agreed upon by a significant number of scholars and his outline of west african empires seems in the main consonant with the best of modern scholarship at the time du bois wrote of these empires few scholars were willing to believe they even existed dr du bois in addition to challenging the aryan myth of superiority took issue with those who espoused the view that islam was responsible for the creation of west african states a position still subscribed to by some scholars islam did not found new states but modified and united negro states already ancient it did not initiate new commerce but developed a widespread trade already established it is as frobenius says easily proved from chronicles written in arabic that islam was only effective in fact as a fertilizer and stimulant efforts to ascribe the artistic products of yoruban civilization to the white race also came in for considerable criticism as did similar efforts so fashionable at the time the negro was writtento attribute every evidence of sophisticated achievement to the inspiration of white people du bois in concluding sets forth the thesis of class conflict and the unity of the white and black working classes for the establishment of a better society writing vigorously and succinctly wesley remarks du bois presented facts about african history and culture which were unknown in  a time when the concept of racial inferiority and african savagery were rampant and dominant in the thought of the american people in the preface to black folk then and now a work published in  du bois commented that he wanted to do again and i hope somewhat more thoroughly the task which i attempted twentythree years ago in a little volume of the home university library called the negro he tells the reader that some of the material of the negro is incorporated in black folk then and now but that the new book is an entirely new production and seeks to bring to notice the facts concerning the negro if not entirely according to the results of thorough scholarship at least with scholarship as good as i am able to command with the time and money at my disposal du bois does not hide the fact that in addition to his role as an historian he will be the advocate of people of african descent observing i do not for a moment doubt that my negro descent and narrow group culture have in many ways predisposed me to interpret my facts too favorably for my race but there is little danger of long misleading here for the champions of white folk are legion the negro has long been the clown of history the football of anthropology and the slave of industry i am trying to show here why these attitudes can no longer be maintained i realize that the truth of history lies not in the mouths of partisans but rather in the calm science that sits between her cause i seek to serve and wherever i fail i am at least paying truth the respect of earnest effort du bois was concerned therefore not only about the history of people of african descent but in addition with the relationship of these facts upon race prejudice in the modern world utilizing materials unavailable at the time the negro was written he seeks to reevaluate africa and its civilization in the light of these more recent findings there is a somewhat detailed discussion of the word negro one in which du bois points out the fallacy of restricting it to certain groups of africans the black and brown people of ethiopia egypt and north africa according to the american standard would be regarded as negroes not whites as certain writers designate them in essential agreement with carter woodson du bois in black folk then and now attacks the practice of designating hamitic peoples as white it is his view that millions of negroidssome of them the blackest of menunder cover of the term hamite were characteristically transferred to the white race by some eager scientists he contends that a hamite is simply a mulatto of ancient negro and semitic blood thus according to du bois the civilizations of north africa owing to the infusion of negro blood must be considered at least in part negroid civilizations a position not only attested by contemporaries such as franz boas but one which is supported by later scholars such as immanuel wallerstein of columbia university suffice it to say now for the purpose of discussing the african past that the best evidence of today seems to indicate a very great racial intermingling in africa as elsewhere over the past five thousand years and that the egyptians or hamites of yesteryear might well find themselves classified as negroes today in precisely those countries where such classifications matter suffice it further to note that many of the archaeological remains of which we shall speak at first credited to arabs or hamites have on closer or less biased inspection turned out to be unmistakably negroafrican in origin in his chapter the trade in men du bois sets forth a number of interesting theories he ascribes the decline of african culture to the slave trade which he contends robbed africa of from a fourth to a third of its population whole regions were depopulated whole tribes disappeared and the character of the people developed excesses of cruelty instead of the flourishing arts of peace and yet du bois avers people ask today the cause of the stagnation of culture in that land since  there are to be sure many africanists who today would question du bois position regarding the number of people lost to the slave trade their figures being considerably more conservative than his yet few deny the contention that the impact of the trade however much it accelerated commerce and stimulated the growth of new kingdoms wreaked considerable havoc among the people whom the trade affected most du bois speaks of the great and significant contribution of the labor of blacks that the trade made available to the rise of western industry and the growth of capitalism a position that eric williams was later to develop in some considerable detail in his capitalism and slavery whatever the contribution of brawn however the human loss was staggering raphael painted luther preached corneille wrote and milton sang and through it all for  years the dark captives wound to the sea amid the bleaching bones of the dead for  years the sharks followed the scurrying ships for  years america was strewn with the living and dying millions of a transplanted race for  years ethiopia stretched forth her hands unto god something of the poetof the historian and prose writer at his best is reflected in the above passage he is more clearly the advocate in the world and africa this work includes a number of chapters on african history chapters which are in some respects quite similar to those found in the negro and black folk then and now the edition published in  contains essays on panafricanism the relationship between africa and china and a variety of additional pieces which appeared originally in newspapers in the foreword of the  edition however du bois describes the world and africa as not so much a history of negroid peoples as a statement of their integral role in human history from prehistoric to modern times the  edition is that and more du bois sees the future of the african people linked with world socialism in this regard it is interesting to note du bois urges africans to base their socialism on the socialism of former african societies and concludes awake awake put on thy strength o zion reject the weakness of missionaries who teach neither love nor brotherhood but chiefly the virtues of in discussing the work of du bois carter woodson and others in the writing of african history august meier concludes most significant was the work of du bois not only was he aware of the complexity and sophistication of contemporary african culture but also acting more on mystic racial yearnings than on scientific investigation du bois was the precursor of the africanist melville j herkovits in tracing the american negro culture and institutions to african origins did his mystic racial yearnings cast him in the role of precursor to the later negritude movement as early as  he wrote i am the smoke king i am black i am darkening with song i am hearkening to wrong i will be black as blackness can the blacker the mantle the mightier the man i am carving god in night i am painting hell in white i am the smoke king i am black the celebration of blacknessthe attempt to transmute its negative attributes into positive onesappears time and time again in the writings of du bois six years before the publication of the souls of black folk du bois gave what was perhaps the first indication that he felt the negro possessed certain peculiar artistic qualities that america could ignore only at her peril the negro said du bois in a paper submitted to the american negro academy had given america its only original music its only touch of humor and pathos amid its mad moneygetting plutocracy du bois then believed in a race spirit which he considered the greatest invention for human progress du bois belief in racial integrity was in this respect similar to that of schomburg who a few years later was to speak of kindling the torches which inspire to racial integrity the negros artistic gifts were due to subtle psychic differences which characterized all men dividing them into races he was later to develop this thesis at some length in a bookthe gift of black folk  the very title of which calls to mind the views of the negritude schooof writers before the appearance of this book however du bois published the souls of black folk a work which affected not only american negroes but africans as well saunders redding reports that peter abrahams of south africa said that until he read this book he had no words with which to express his negroness abrahams himself wrote that the book had the impact of a revelation  a key to the understanding of my world the dualism so prevalent in the thinking of leopold senghor aime cesaire and other proponents of negritude is expressed by du bois in the opening chapter of souls it is a peculiar sensation this doubleconsciousness this sense of always looking at ones self through the eyes of others of measuring ones soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity one ever feels his twonessan american a negro two souls two thoughts two unreconciled strivings two warring ideals in one dark body whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder® and there is the same longing for a higher synthesis of which senghor speaks in referring to cross cultural fertilization he the negro would not africanize america for america has too much to offer the world and africa he would not bleach his negro soul in a flood of white americanism for he knows that negro blood has a message for the world the allusions to negro blood often appear in the writings of du bois just as senghor often refers to african blood the negro never lost his african temperament or style of life du bois asserts in the gift of black folk he refers to a peculiar spiritual quality which the negro has brought into american life and civilization a certain spiritual joyousness a sensuous tropical love of life as against new england reason which was cool and cautious a slow and dreamful conception of the universe together with an intense sensitiveness to spiritual valuesall qualities which in his view tell of the imprint of africa on europe in america there is no denying or explaining away du bois remarks this tremendous contact of the north and south of black and white of anglosaxon and negro the qualities of negritude of being negro developed deep in the forest fastness and by the banks of low vast rivers in the deep tense quiet of the jungle where the human soul whispered its folk tales carved its pictures sang its rhythmic songs and danced and danced describing the music of the slavethe spiritualdu bois hears the sorrow of riven souls suddenly articulate the sobs of raped daughters the quiver of murdered bodies the defiance of deathless hope it is great art born of suffering and tragedy in another passage from the gifts of black folk du bois describes the slave laborer as a product of the tropics who possessed sensuous receptivity to the beauty of the world and was therefore not easily reduced to the mechanical drafthorse which the northern european laborer became though often accused of laziness the slave brought to modern manual labor a renewed valuation of life du boisin affirming the emotional nature of negroes in his use of culture as a basis for group solidarity in zealously attempting to rediscover the historic roots of the negro people in positing the notion that negroeswherever they livehave a certain style of life and in his allusions to primitive african socialismwas a precursor of negritude much like cesaire his negritude theories were not hammered into a comprehensive system of thought and like cesaire they appear to derive more from his personal stand as a writer student of history and culture and black man caught between two worlds as charles wesley has written most of du bois workseven his novelshave included some material on the african background in addition to books and articles in which mention was made of africa for many years du bois promoted a pageant based on the african past a pageant designed for children it appears that his mind conceived practically every conceivable use to which african history could be put including teaching it in sunday school to youngsters this is not the place for an assessment of his work in fathering and promoting the panafrican movement let it suffice to say as has martin kilson that he had a deep spiritual attachment to and belief in africa and her peoples and in his dedication to panafricanism there was no sacrifice too great for him to bear nor any road too difficult for him to travel he has been hailed as the father of panafricanism by heads of african countries and his influence has been recognized by african leaders from kenyatta to nkrumah it can be said in perfect justice that generations of negro intellectuals changed their negative views of africa due to the influence of du bois  he left the united states in his nineties and returned to africa to become a citizen of ghana and set in motion a project of which he had long dreamedthe writing of an encyclopedia africana when he died at  he had at least lived to see a number of stages in the project completed more importantly however he had left behind an historic record which today corroborates the view which he espoused in  at the london panafrican conference that the worlds history both ancient and modern has given many instances of no despicable ability and capacity among the blackest races of men
let us suppose that by edict of some authority it was decreed that a theory similar to the nazi master race theory must be incorporated in our american history and taught in our schools  certainly the public would be shocked and revolted by a decree affirming the superiority of aryans and the inferiority of jews teachers would rise in horror how could we teach this false theory how could we pervert the history of our country and commit such injury to the tender and impressionable minds of our youth but let us go on to suppose that we were compelled by an irresistible force to do what we fully knew was so shockingly wrong so repugnant to our consciences as teachers and citizens our phrases parroting the false doctrine would be labored and reluctant surely the sense of joy in teaching would become only a faint memory the sweat doubt and struggle of our creative act of teaching would be destroyed the common striving that gives joy and excitement to both students and teachers the search that is eager and hard for knowledge and understanding could no longer exist butis not all this just nightmare fantasy certainly we do not we need not violate our consciences in such a way in our american history classrooms our traditional history but why ask we dont teach the fantastic nazi master race theory no we do not we teach our own the ruling groups in the south have traditionally insisted that in their schools american history be taught from a white supremacist standpoint recent authoritative scholarship has shown that from about  to world war ii the study of american history was dominated by scholars who reflected or accepted biased views in their work at the turn of the century john w burgess dean of the faculty of political science at columbia university in the introduction to his major work reconstruction and the constitution said a black skin means membership in a race of men which has never of itself succeeded in subjecting passion to reason has never therefore created any civilization of any kind it is also known that textbook publishers went even beyond the prevailing scholarly interpretations in their desire to cater to the southern market northern school systems based their teaching on these textbooks and historical interpretations thus a biased and censored version of american history became imbedded in both northern and southern classrooms we all grew up on itour traditional history this did not happen by the imposition of a triumphant dictatorship newly swept into power in a nation caught up in a mad ideological rampage no in our country this grand miswriting of history seeped into books teaching and traditions through the hard work of serious scholars aided and abetted by racial theories and in stitutions that flourished after the civil war as they had before weigh the magnitude of the issue it is often alluded to by the term negro history it is that and much more the course of race relationships with all of its ramifications for white and negro comprises one of the mainstreams of american history we can only contemplate what our history would have been and what our country would be like today if people from africa had come to america as freemen instead of being brought here as slaves clearly a wholesale distortion of the history of race relationships in the united states amounts to nothing less than a major falsification of americas past even so what are the effects they could hardly be benevolent our traditional history has been a bulwark of the prevailing system of prejudice discrimination and segregation in this nation insofar as we continue to deny a valid account of their history to our students both negro and white we continue to cripple their ability to understand and confront the dangerous and immoral racial system which remains deeprooted throughout our nation all in the name of education and at the taxpayers expense but as educators are we not also victims what other history could we know what other books could we obtain in the last two decades a new scholarship has emerged one which has effectively challenged this traditional history the works of its distinguished scholars are now widely accepted and respected in our universities furthermore the pioneering research of previously neglected historians such as carter g woodson and w e b dubois has achieved widespread recognition certainly the many articles monographs and books of these revisionist historians have been available to teachers civil_rights groups have publicized the issue as have nationally popular magazines such as saturday review time and newsweek yet how many teachers have responded to the challenge have we said there could be no more serious charge about my work i must sample this new scholarship to be able to assess it for myself i must bring this issue urgently to the attention of my colleagues since it is a professional challenge we must resolve together what would it mean in our classrooms if we taught the historythatactuallyhappened with the help of valid scholarship instead of that historythatwastransmitteddowntous let us explore a bit the imaginary melting pot how relevant to studentsand how historically accurateis the traditional introduction to an  american history course students are told in the fifth grade again in the eighth grade and finally in the th grade that america is made up of a blend of many nationalitiesirish english dutch italian french and so on yet we exclude africans consider the provocative themes if we confronted the entire rainbow of america including africanamericans those forced immigrants for whom there was no melting in the imaginary pot perhaps teachers foresee some difficulty in mentioning the old world of africa we have studied some european history we know something of the great chinese civilizations and have confidence in our knowledge of the contributions of these great ancestors yet too often our studentsboth negro and whitethink of africa only as the dark continent egypt the cradle of civilization seems to have slipped into the mediterranean sea and her black men and women are lost chapters of history negro students know only too well that for them the melting pot is a myth but they must also learn that the dark continent is equally unreal should not their introduction to american history include the earliest use of the wheel the story of the civilizations of kush the empires of ghana mali and songhay the great city of timbuktu and the university of sankore with its scholars of many hues we will have provided ne gro youngsters with the ability to walk with new pride through the halls of their schools calling themselves askia the great or munsa musa and our white studentswill they gain a new breadth of knowledge and a shaken sense of superiority the freedom to destroy freedom w if it is true that we as a nation look with horror upon the mass murder by nazi germany of more than  million persons and as teachers cannot overlook this aspect of teaching world war ii how can we continue to ignore the depopulation of the continent of africa as a result of slave trading historians state that in excess of  million africans were taken from their homelands twothirds of these human beings perished as a result of the brutalities of the trade were not these engaged in thiseuropeans americans and africans alikecorrupted in a process whereby millions of souls  » were lost what of our rationale for the continued importation of africans to north america were white people really concerned with bringing the benefits of christianity and civilization to black people malcolm cowley in the introduction to black cargoes a history of the atlantic slave trade  states that   the slave trade left behind it a myth of negro inferiority an embittered conflict and a sense of guilt that refuses to disappear it is as if we were all responsible now for the sin of our forefathers and as if the sin was so great that not even the civil war could atone for it what response would it provoke if we placed the slave trade in its historical context of the renaissance period dr w e b du bois called the renaissance a birth of a new freedom   the freedom to destroy freedom to exploit should we help our students locate the slave trade in the world forces of the renaissance the commercial revolution of european economic life the rise of national states in western europe and the foundation of the new world black americas strivings why is it after much time spent studying the civil war and its causes and effects so many american high school students have demonstrated by hostile reactions to open housing or school integration their desire to fight this war all over againamerican brother against american brother white power against black_power have we as teachers allowed this sea of ignorance to overflow into the streets of our isolated white communities have we been teaching the causes of the civil war as though the institution of slavery played no significant part if the black man in american history was viewed as a part of the events of our heritage if his hopes his ambitions his enslavement and resistance to that enslavement his manhood in fact were considered would this not help stem the swirling tide of prejudice apparently we have allowed our students to assume that slaves didnt think react to their conditions or desire freedom we must document not only the lives of the plantation slave and the household slave but the lives of the many slaves who worked in the cities of the south as carpenters mechanics shipbuilders etc richard c wade in the introduction to his book slavery in the cities the south  states the important books and significant controversies have all assumed the plantation and farm to be the special setting of the institution yet from almost the beginning slavery was also urban    and    was in many ways quite different from its rural analogue thousands of free negroes lived both north and south and many negro men and women joined the abolitionist movement but in our classrooms they seem to get lost in a toobrief study of garrison and phillips the many national and state conventions held by negro men throughout this nation from colonial days attest to their paramount desire for freedom the eloquent statements prepared at these conventions and addressed to our national government should become a part of our storehouse of knowledge perhaps then white  americans will not look with surprise upon the organizations of black americans today addressing the nation for equal rights we can learn much from the words of richard cain a negro congressman from south carolina on the floor of the house of representatives in washington in  cain said to his white colleagues    i am clothed with humanity like you i think i reason i talk i express my views as you do is there any difference between us not so far as our manhood is concerned unless it be in this that our opinions differ and mine are a little higher up than yours in fact only a small minority of whites worked actively against the racial system and received rather little honor for their efforts is it not reasonable to assume that black americas strivings were more in keeping with our espoused democracy than white americas actions lincoln was not  our man it should come as no surprise that nearly  negroes fought for their freedom in the civil war when we are aware of the thousands of negroes who died attempting to revolt against the system that enslaved them and their loved ones negroes will come alive in the pages of history when their debates with each other and with white abolitionists and revolutionists become a part of the drama of the classroom we must ask such fundamental questions as the following did frederick douglass agree with john brown what about the negroes who were with john brown when he raided harpers ferry what motivated them did frederick douglass simply support a braham lincoln and not disagree with him when douglass summed up his measure of lincoln at the unveiling of the freedmens monument to the man he said   lincoln was not in the fullest sense of the word either our man or our model in his interests in his associations in his habits of thought and in his prejudices he was a white man    we are at best only his stepchildren children by adoption children by force of circumstance and necessity but  we entreat you to despise not the humble offering we this day unveil to view for while abraham lincoln saved for you a country he delivered us from a bondage according to jefferson one hour of which was worse than ages of the oppression your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose should not our students confront the great emancipator as a man as well as a myth the measure of racism an historical phenomenon the days of reconstruction following the civil war offer the most meaningful backdrop upon which to sketch the events of the recent freedom movements in the south unfortunately if we have not provided that backdrop we cannot expect our students to live in a changing society with a sense of appreciation for the historic events which have occurred since rosa parks sat down in the white section of a bus in montgomery as negroes protest their inability to vote in america today we should be able to contrast and compare the events of a hundred years ago in the same counties of the south instead too many history texts today write off the reconstruction period as a blackout of honest government we teach that money was spent unwisely during reconstruction without stating the many reforms instituted which cost extra moneythe establishment of the first public school system in the south for example we decry the carpetbaggers without realizing that many dedicated northerners went south to teach and help rebuild people and places we ignore the many black men who were free and educated in europe canada and the north during the slave period and decided to return to the south to help reconstruct their people and governmentwhich now included them we must examine carefully the black codes the documents of the early reconstruction written by white men desiring a return to slavery and the birth of the klan which gave strength to these laws then compare these codes to the new constitutions written three years later in  by both negro and white men attempting to build a democracy in their southern states we find in the speeches of negro congressmen elected from their southern states to the senate and the house from the s to  the words of men who were proud to be black and spoke eloquently for lasting civil_rights congressman richard cain directed the following remarks to white southern congressmen who opposed an  civil_rights bill there are periods in the histories of nations and of peoples when it is necessary that men belonging to a race or races whose rights and interests are at stake should lay aside all feelings of delicacy and hesitation and vindicate their rights their character and their nationality  i have been surprised at their attempts to ridicule and cast a slur upon a race of men whose labor has enabled them and theirs for  years to feed and drink and thrive and fatten  the debates on that bill in  should be contrasted  with debates on recent civil_rights legislation what eagerness young people have for the truths which will give them the ability to understand the history which they view each day in their newspapers and on television screens place the plessy vs ferguson decision of  the compromise speech of booker t washington in  the rewriting of each southern state constitution and the period of the white mans burden in the philippines hawaii and cuba in  into the context of the racism of the new political leaders of this period when we see this complete picture of the birth of jim crow we can understand better the need for a civil_rights revolution to put an end to jim crow today have our students had a chance to dig into the tortured history of white supremacy as it developed in and affected white society in what kind of trap did white society blindly entangle itself as it pursued its massive attempts to crush the humanity of black people in southern white society before the civil war free speech and political processes were denied to any who would voice opposition to slavery violence was imbedded in the life of the communitywhether shown by the scars that marked the bodies of many slaves or by the semimilitary pattern of life in a land ever fearful of revolt a superbly ingenious moral hypocrisy imbued the thought patterns of its citizenry spokesmen of the south trump eted its superior morality and civilization while its businessmen protected by law tore apart the families of fellow humans southern economic progress was stultified under the slave system public education lagged far behind the other regions and its system of justice was subverted to the cause of human chatteldom all this is past the slaves were freed but racism became entrenched in america and when will we be free of it can our students then take the measure of racism in america as an historical phenomenon  its depth scope nature and future men we shall have  the record of the pastas it is transmitted to usis a living force today our traditional history is part of our consciousness it expresses itself in our daily thoughts and emotions in our interpretations of current events and our responses to these events those who wrote the traditional history which has been incorporated in textbooks and classrooms are still guiding our understanding and attitudes what they wrought is one of the keystones of the structure of racism that prevails in this country today that integrity in history is sacrificed to racial bias should be no surprise the fundamental premise of racismthat one group is superior in human qualities and the other inferioris itself false white supremacy needed a falsified na tional history to protect its original lieand got it negro children must attend school under our compulsory school laws there they are taught a history which on the one hand is compounded of prevarications based on white supremacist assumptions and which on the other hand robs them of their heritage as people of african descent and as citizens of this country what more could we do to undermine psychologically a group of unprotected children this is lying and stealing on a vast insidious and devastating scale white children too have been denied the history of their country what illusions fears and anxieties have been created as a consequence what intellectual emotional and moral disabilities have been born is this then what is happening in classrooms across america is this what we call our creative act of teachingleading our children to the poisonous wells of racist history can teachers fulfill their responsibility without knowledge of the best of modern scholarship can we simply depend upon a new textbook or must we dig into the writings of franklin woodward woodson stampp du bois and others we need not try to become experts but we should explore enough to grasp the major themes and issues to be able to consider to judge and to change this would take time and effort but the new american history this negro history and the history of white racismwhat compelling shocking reading many doubts will arise doubts about the ability to change the difficulties of change there will be inward struggle as old knowledge and attitudes resist the impact of new experience and there will be struggle in the classroom new materials new concepts new objectives how will the students respond and fellow teachers administrators parents but this struggle is not a new one the prophetic du bois sixtyfour years ago challenged teachers with the issue and the hope that lies in it
malcolms essential content was so simple and elemental his arguments like thoreaus so unanswerable that the american press even when not covertly racist could not understand him accustomed as it is to the settled contradictions of civil logic in a biracial country what answer is there to the accusations that in a large part of america a century after the th amendment some kinds of murderers cannot be punished by law that the law is the murderer is it an answer that we must tolerate injustice so that we may enjoy justice contemning such deformed logic and adhering to obvious moral truths malcolm like the bogalusa deacons had little difficulty in understanding and explaining to his audiences the thomistic conception of law better than the attorney general of the united states understands it malcolm was always disconcerted when the powers that be and their exponents refused to recognize the legality of humanity his strongest vocal emphases were on words like law and right they dont use law he exclaimed of the central congolese government which was directed by outside interests and the lawfulness of the eastern government was more valid he thought because it was of its own people justice and equity and emancipation not violence not hatred not retribution and not the theology of the muslims were the central matter of malcolms oratory though that theology was useful as a repudiation of american white christianity he had entered the stream of sane and moral social teaching before his parting from elijah muhammad and was deepening his knowledge and expression of it at the moment of the death he expected each day   john illo the rhetoric of malcolm_x in the columbia university forum
 in the american south the system of justice is crude barbaric and savage there are few parallels for it in a civilized society it is a system which enables whites to murder or maim negroes with scarcely any fear of retribution it is a system which provides for the savage cruel punishment of negroes for crimes they did or did not commit hundreds of examples can be given of this shameless thriving barbarism it is true that american liberals are vigorously fighting this system it is true that american newspapers far from hiding the evil brutal system of southern justice are exposing and condemning it but it is equally true that the system persists with the american public people standing by and doing nothing effective about it it is a grave indictment of their country that such horrors should continue   joel mervis editor of south africas johannesburg times in the louisville courierjournal
since july of  millions of moviegoers in this country and throughout the world have seen the spectacular motion picture khartoumin cinerama ultrapanavision and technicolor some movie critics have hailed this picture as nothing less than superb and the most realistic battle action in movie history others have said that this is historical truth brought to the screen this is where the appraisers have erred the truth about the battle for the sudan in the s has been distorted to suit the needs and prejudices of the hollywood movie czars and their subjects who are mainly white the picture stars charlton heston as general charles gordon the enigmatic british mystic who was sent to the sudan in central africa to rescue an egyptian army and thousands of british civilians besieged in khartoum by the nationalist uprising of muhammad ahmad the mahdi and his devoted followers in the picture and in the extensive advertisements about it the mahdi is depicted as an arab religious fanatic he was both religious and a fanatical african nationalist but he was not an arab he was a moslem very often when it suits the antiafrican propaganda purpose of most white writers and nearly all white motion picture makers africans who are moslems and heroes are called arabs this infers that they are white men by this not so subtle method people of african descent all over the world are robbed of heroes that rightfully belong to them the motion picture khartoum is a case in point the black writer must now examine and sometimes challenge all interpretations of the history of his people and their heroes that have been made by other people for an examination of the life and times of muhammad ahmad known as the mahdi a few questions are in order who was this man and what is the significance of his fight to free the sudan from british and egyptian rule what is the importance of his country and his people what indeed is the real mahdi story the sudan is an old african country and it has not always been called the sudan it was once a part of the biblical land of kush and has also been known as nubia or bilad alnuba the arabs called the country bilad alsudan meaning the land of the blacks from the early part of the sixteenth century to the latter part of the nineteenth century the sudan was dominated by a series of invaders who ruled recklessly and taxed the people without mercy or any consideration for their well being corruption and injustice went unopposed for  years until in  a great leader appeared to unite the sudanese people against their oppressors his name was muhammad ahmadibnseyyidabdullah his career is synonymous with the title mahdi meaning one who is divinely directed when muhammad ahmad assumed the mahdiship in  he was under  he was born in august  on an island in the nile river called labab in the province of dongala his family claimed to be descendants of the prophet mahomet though they were humble boat builders while muhammad ahmads brothers followed their fathers trade he displayed an aptitude for religious studies muhammad ahmad the youngest of his parents four sons was sent to a khalwa school to learn reading and writing and to commit the koran to memory his interest and enthusiasm inspired his teachers to send him to a second school in khartoum and a third one in the gezira where he completed his studies of the koran and then studied muslim laws and traditions later he journeyed to the city of berber to pursue religious studies at the hands of the sheikh mahed el kheir the renowned religious leader of the time the most notable of his many teachers was sheikh muhammad sharif by  muhammad ahmad had acquired a large following and was proclaimed the mahdithe future savior of the sudan the mahdi having challenged the authority of the government had no option but to prepare for the jihad or holy war in defense of islam and for the freedom of the sudan he started to train his followers and to prepare his flags on which he inscribed there is no god but god muhammad is his prophet and the mahdi is his caliph the government detachments landed in aba in the middle of a dark night in the rainy season the soldiers felt their way towards the village amongst grass and bush and lagoons all of a sudden the mahdists fell on them using swords and spears and giving them no time to use their firearms the majority of the soldiers lost their lives and the small number that escaped the disaster fled to khartoum in their steamers the mahdists rejoiced in their first triumph and in the spoils of arms and ammunition left behind which they could use in days to come that was on august   the mahdist revolution against the turkoegyptian regime had started the mahdi and his followers automatically became rebels after the incident at aba as their island was within easy reach of the government and as they were still in a minority they deemed it wise to migrate west far way from the government and to unite with their allies and associates in kordofan and the nuba mountains the mahdi and his small group of followers crossed the white nile from aba on their way westward they were continually joined by followers until they reached taqali in taqali king adam umm dabbalu gave them a hearty reception and promised them his protection the mahdi and his followers then moved to jabal qadir the attempts of the governor of kordofan to intercept their progress failed and the mahdists reached jabal qadir in safety there they were joined by the inhabitants of the surrounding mountains who flocked to join the mahdist cause others from the different parts of the sudan then journeyed in large numbers to join the mahdi and to take part in the new mission and in the struggle against the government all internal attempts to nip the mahdist revolution in the bud failed it then became imperative for egypt assisted by great britain to face the situation a large army was conscripted out of the disrupted egyptian nationalist army of urabi pasha and others and sent to khartoum by sea via suakin as soon as preparations were complete for an expedition against the mahdi the army under the command of hicks pasha moved forward the expedition first followed the white nile southwards to al dueim then it struck westward into a country most hostile to it in order to come within range of the mahdists the scouts of the mahdist army lost no chance of attacking them whenever circumstances allowed and in compliance with the orders of the mahdists the villages on the route of the turkoegyptian army were evacuated and the wells filled with earth the country through which the army was to pass was thus left desolate of inhabitants and short of drinking water as the situation of the army grew more pathetic every day differences of opinion between ala aldin pasha and hicks pasha the leaders of the army sharpened when hicks pashas expedition reached alrahad after a long and tiring march and then moved towards kazgail the mahdist hordes from el obeid and those who joined them from the baqqare jimas tribe under their sheikh asakir abu alkalam had arrived on the scene as hicks army was marching out of kazgail and entering the forest of shaykan the mahdists fell on them and a fierce battle raged for a whole day hicks army was annihilated almost to the last soldier in november  with the defeat of hicks expedition the government lost its last disciplined army and most of its men and stores in the sudan what remained of the armies of the government were distributed in small garrisons defending the remaining posts those garrisons could not be depended upon in the governments struggle against mahdism the victorious mahdi then returned to el obeid to allow his armies the wellearned rest they required after their long struggle against the government to receive more disciples and followers and to start a new victorious era in the annals of the revolution soon afterwards slatin bey governor of darfur surrendered his province and became a prisoner of the mahdi for a very long time from el obeid the mahdi also sent emissaries and small forces to preach mahdism and to harass the remaining garrisons of the turkiya so the west succumbed to mahdism and the central sudan associated itself with it in the eastern sudan osman digna the mahdist hero who joined mahdism on the fall of el obeid and who was dispatched by the mahdi in the capacity of a mahdist amir to preach mahdism was able to win the tribes of the red sea hills to the mahdist cause they then began to harass the government headquarters in the eastern sudan he captured sinkat and laid siege to the government garrisons in suakin and tokar from his headquarters near suakin osman digna continually attacked the government garrisons in suakin and tokar while the mahdists moved from one victory to the other in the west now muhammad ahmad and general gordon at khartoum became rival claimants for supremacy over the minds of the sudanese people they were also rivals in another sense for both of them claimed to be the messengers of god the mahdi called himself muhammad ahmad el mahdi monutazer that is to say the prophet and guide awaited by the world his followers had already adopted the cry of muhammad ahmad rassoul allah nili allah    roughly translated muhammad the messiah and messenger of allah of the many rumors that were being circulated about him and his followers one was that he intended to invade egypt to convert the mussulmen to the true faith from which they had strayed and after a massacre of the christians in egypt to go to mecca the holy city of his faith where he expected to receive the khalifat and be ordained the grand cheikh of islam the future battle lines had been drawn and both contestants had been pushed beyond the point where a compromise could be reached the mahdi was invited to khartoum to be examined in the koran to see if he was really the expected messiah he rejected the invitation and sent back the message by the grace of god and his holy prophet i am master in the sudan never shall i come to khartoum to justify myself with this sort of preaching he struck the right chord in the character of the moslem and all other sudanese tribes his plan was to unite all in one great faith wisely for his scheme he recognized the general state of discontent and most astutely used it as a fertile ground for his message he was a religious leader but he also was a shrewd politician he based arguments on the prevailing hard times and traced these to the existing government his astuteness was again shown in the way he selected as the field of his earliest efforts the most disturbed section of the country the british authorities offered a large sum for him dead or alive this action forced the mahdi to declare a holy war he promised his rapidly increasing followers the majority share of the spoils he intended to take from the oppressors a quarrel developed between the commanders sent to seize the mahdi the quarrel broke into an open fight and the two separate companies of soldiers were weakened to ineffectiveness the mahdi and his followers fell on these troops with clubs sharp sticks and stones in a short while they were destroyed then came the mahdis attempt to capture el obeid the capital of kordofan and though driven back with great losses he prevailed until after a siege of five months the town and garrison surrendered now he was hailed as the maker of miracles praise allah the messiah had come the government no longer looked upon him as a holy man zealous for religion but poor and without influence whom they could silence easily the government had already come to be despised by the people because of its weakness and corruption while the prestige of muhammad ahmad was in the ascendency the spirit of rebellion which prevailed in egypt no doubt helped to augment fanaticism in the sudan the government again sent for muhammad and he again refused to go there now followed in surprisingly rapid succession defeat after defeat for the government and success after success for the mahdi now the personality and activity of the mahdi stirred the whole of the sudanand the hopeless became hopeful and the leaderless had found a leader from the hills and the plains deserts and forests the  tribes rallied to the black flag of the mahdi and pledged allegiance to his crusade tens of thousands of them the selem baggara risega homer dirrka bongo madi and bari poured into the new messiahs camp they came on horseback and on foot armed with rifles and lances or with homemade spears some were the poorest of the poor and wore only filthy loin cloths the british and the egyptians braced themselves against this tide and reshuffled their plans and forces still the tribes gathered thicker in the mahdis camp they had but one goal in view freedom or paradise the british realizing that they were about to be pushed out of the sudan brought in their most able general charles george gordon better known as chinese gordon he had served in this region before and already had a respected reputation there he was known to most of the people and liked by a large number of them gordon was a devout christian and like the mahdi had illusions of being divinely endowed when gordon arrived at khartoum he found the situation more desperate than the force at his command could master knowing the country and its people better than most englishmen he decided to use diplomacy after the collapse of his illadvised attempts to bring the exslave trader zobeir pasha to his assistance he finally had to deal directly with the mahdi gordon offered to make the mahdi governorgeneral of a large province the mighty mahdi interpreted this gesture as an insult and ridiculed gordon for making itthinking why should he be a mere governorgeneral of a province when the whole of the sudan except one or two places was already his in reply he urged gordon to forsake his devout christian beliefs and become a moslem to gordon this of course was unthinkable being a practical military man he knew that he did not have the power he needed to defend khartoum he sent the women and children out of the city and awaited the mahdi who arrived soon afterward and laid siege to the city after the siege had lasted many months the british sent an expedition of  men under the command of lord wolsley to support general gordons army at khartoum lord wolsley whose victory over the egyptians at telekebir in  was the decisive factor in establishing british rule over egypt proceeded up the nile with his expedition in  boats hoping to reach general gordon before his army was overrun by the mahdis dedicated adherents at abu klea he met part of the mahdis forces and won a victory in the battle that followed while suffering heavy losses the bright memory of lord wolsleys victory barely had time to become real before his second in command general stewart was beaten and killed after weeks of hardship part of lord wolsleys expedition reached omdurman a few miles from khartoum in the journey the british ships had to sail through severe attacks by moslem krupp guns lord wolsleys success at abu klea and in bringing the expedition up the nile was a commendable feat of leadership but it did not save general gordon two days before his arrival january   khartoum had fallen to the mahdis army the long day siege ended when  of the mahdis fanatical army swarmed over the ramparts of the battlescarred city and surrounded the palace of governorgeneral gordon gordon a stalwart soldier to the end walked calmly out on the steps where a giant kordofan soldier follower of the mahdi ran him through with a spear an officer named nisser beheaded him with his sword hundreds of soldiers plunged their spears into his body his head was sent to the mahdi who at least admired him as a soldier and had hoped to make him a moslem convert the story of gordons attempt to save the sudan for england was all the more pathetic because his task showed every indication of failure before he set himself to it the fall of khartoum and gordons tragic end was a severe blow to english pride that might have been avoided to add to this another expedition composed of  english and egyptian soldiers was defeated with great losses at kassala by the mahdis most able general osman digna general gordon had made the city of khartoum his headquarters then had been hemmed in on all sides until the city was cut off from the outside world while his supplies of food guns and ammunition were used up in a lost and hopeless cause he had stood bravely to his port trying to inspire a hundred men to do the work of thousands then being baffled and harassed by the shiftlessness and incompetency of his officers he made promises he could not keep until his word as an englishman began to fall on unlistening ears yet he inspired a listless population to resist for  days then came the night attack and the father and saviour of the sudan lay dead in the midst of this chaos lord wolsley retreated to cairo with what remained of his army later bent on avenging his and englands honor he asked for a chance to attack the mahdi again and was permitted to do so he returned the same year with  white troops and was beaten back now england withdrew from all of sudan except the port of suakin which could be defended by warships the mahdi prevailed over the rest of the sudan  the mahdi and his forces crossed the west bank of the white nile and there in the desert laid the foundation of the capitol of his new kingdom he was now supreme master of a rich empire  miles long and  miles wide his subjects had been gathered from every district and tribe some gave him homage willingly some through fear the mahdis ambition was still running high he thought of himself as another mohammed he planned to bring all adjoining territories under his rule subdue the christian part of ethiopia march into egypt and convert the world to islam his amazing career ended before any of these dreams were realized on june   six months after the death of general gordon he died of typhoid fever with his last strength he shouted the islam creed his followers mourned him for months and later erected a magnificent tomb on the spot where he died the mahdi was succeeded by his second in command khalifa abdullahi who ruled the country for  troublesome years before the british gave lord kitchener enough men to reconquer the sudan in avenging what he thought was englands honor lord kitchener showed no mercy and considered nothing to be sacred while he was accomplishing his mission he more than earned the title the butcher of omdurman he bombarded the tomb of the mahdi took his bones and threw them into the nile it was said that mahdis head was packed in a kerosene tin and later used by kitchener as a tobacco container in spite of lord kitchener and those who came after him the followers of the mahdi continued to fight the british until about  in the many books and papers written about him the mahdi became a romantic hero in the eyes of some of the englishmen who had fought him in his introduction to the book the mahdi of allah by richard a bermann the late winston churchill said the life of the mahdi is a romance in miniature and wonderful as that of mohammed himself the rebellion of the sudan was the last great outburst of the bloodred flower of islam the mahdi and his caliphate might well have endured to today and developed as stately a power as the moors in spain as for the unanswered questionwas muhammad ahmad the mahdi really a messiah well millions of people in the sudan believed he was and some still do but let this truth suffice the mahdi and his successors were rightfully fighting against injustice and colonial misrule among other reasons the aftermath of this fight moved the british to adopt a more humane and enlightened administration in the sudan this policy eventually helped to make the sudan the free and independent country we know today
he occasion a historic t one was the consecration of most rev harold perry a negro in new orleans as the procession of prelates and priests filed through the entrance of the stately basilica of st louis king of france an onlooker muttered to his companion next thing you know these catholics will be having a colored pope  a man of such obviously discriminating tastes deserves to be told the truth africa has given popes as well as saints and martyrs to the church so commented pope paul vi in giving his apostolic blessing to africa on the occasion of the canonization of the martyrs of uganda the negro popes referred to by the present holy father were victor i  melchiades  and gelasius   all three are honored in the church as saints at least one of them victor was a martyr for the faith each contributed mightily to the development of the church in the crucial centuries following its foundation victor a native african became pope in the year  and reigned for  years in church history he invariably gets honorable mention for his part in settling the controversy then raging in rome on the matter of when the pivotal feast of easter should be celebrated at that time a large colony of asiatic christians lived in rome the exile asians observed easter with great pomp and ceremony as well as with feasting while the christians of rome were still subject to the rigors of lent victor called for conformity concerning easter throughout the church when the bishops of asia minor proved reluctant to change their traditional time of observance pope victor promptly excommunicated them and despite appeals from the west on their behalf stuck fast for several years to the sentence he had pronounced nor did he relent until the observance of easter on the sunday immediately following the forty days of lent was universal though the easter controversy would arise in a new form in later times when the church had spread to the british isles it was settled for all of what was christendom in his day by the vigorous victor ever efficient and methodical pope victor called the first roman synod of history he also declared latin the official language of the church despite the evergrowing use of the vernacular in church  functions today this decree is still in effect so meticulous was pope victor in his guardianship of morals that he is credited with writing a treatise on the evils of playing dice less elegantly known in modern times as shooting craps his only extant writings however deal exclusively with the easter controversy pope victor was the scourge of the heretics of his era most aggressive were the gnostics but victor faced them fearlessly he also tackled theodotus a leather goods merchant who denied the divinity of christ he excommunicated the impious heretic blastus with a name like that he was simply asking for it for himself and his followers during the pontificate of pope victor the emperors persecution of the christians was suspended due to the intercession of marcia an influential lady of the imperial household when victor gave marcia a list of the christians who had been sentenced to slavery in the sardinian mines she arranged for their release pope victor effectively took advantage of the period of peace to advance the cause of the still small and struggling christian church his great contribution to christianity was achieved by his vigorous pronouncements by the power of his pen st jerome called him the foremost latin writer in the church and above all by his benign personality which won him universal respectpope victor i died a martyr in the year  his burial place was close to that of st peter apostle and first martyrpope july th is the feastday of pope st victor the next negro to occupy the chair of peter was melchiades of africa also known as miltiades or milziadus prior to his accession the church had been considerably weakened by imperial persecution and by internal strife his immediate predecessors popes marcellus and eusebius had both been deposed and sent into exile after the death of eusebius in sicily there followed two years of turmoil and confusion during which the papal throne remained vacant when miltiades was elected pope in  he faced a formidable task soon however the policy of persecuting the christians was abandoned in both east and west and after the accession of constantine as emperor the church finally emerged from the catacombs  pope miltiades set out to salvage and to reconstruct the battered and broken bark of peter in this he proved to be a willing and skillful craftsman in the lateran palace restored to christian possession by the wife of constantine miltiades presided over a synod of  bishops most important item on the agenda was a discussion on the state of the church in africa where a heretic donatus had done much damage by his intrigues donatus was condemned by the synod and once again matters ecclesiastical flourished duce the  to pro in africa soon great augustine writing of his fellowcountryman st augustine referred to pope miltiades as an excellent pontiffthough his rule of the church was of short duration about four years miltiades accomplished much for the church he provided the strong leadership required in a time of transition pope miltiades died in  significantly he who had arranged an honorable burial for his exiled predecessor eusebius was by his own wishes it would seem buried in the same cemetery area of the catacombs the cemetery of st calixtus they were the last popes to be interred in the catacombs the feastday of pope st miltiades is december  the third negro pope was st gelasius born in rome of african parents and member of the roman diocesan clergy at the time of his election to the papacy the eastern church with headquarters at constantinople was in schism from rome euphemius patriarch of constantinople returned to the faith but refused to consider his former associate acacius a heretic gelasius made it clear that he would not restore euphemius to the full honors of the patriarchate till the diptych honoring acacius was removed from the walls of constantinoples principal church encountering obstinacy on the part of euphemius pope gelasius stood firm in reply to appeals from bishops of the west the pope pointed out that his attitude toward euphemius was not a personal matter but one of principle  pope gelasius resented imperial interference in ecclesiastical matters in a letter to the emperor anastasius the pope defined the functions of church and state and pointed out that the ideal relationship between them was that they should be ancillary and not antagonistic to each other this letter is still frequently quoted when churchstate controversies arise possibly as a result of this widely hailed letter pope gelasius enjoyed a friendlier relationship with emperor theodoric the successor of anastasius many of his own roman flock caused grief to the heart of the good gelasius by their return to superstitious practices particularly in connection with the revived pagan festival of lupercal gelasius condemned christian participation in the rites particularly those associated with fertility it would seem however that some of the more innocent customs were permitted to continue and to this toleration we most likely owe the sentimental observance of st valentines day a feature of the lupercalia held at mid february was the relatively harmless juno februata this part of the celebration centered on a drawing of names for the purpose of matrimonial matchmaking the practice some say was christianized by associating it with the feast of st valentine which coincided with the date of juno februata in any case pope gelasius was successful in restoring the superstitious dissidents to the integrity of the faith his writings reveal that he was a man of deep learning the letter to emperor anastasius on church and state establishes him as the first political science writer of christianity in addition he was an authority on the matter of papal infallibility as a liturgist he left his mark by introducing better order more beauty and added stateliness into church services pope gelasius led a humble prayerful and ascetical life just and charitable to all he was especially considerate of the poor dionysius exiguus th century scholar wrote of pope gelasius that he was more a servant than a sovereign the great gelasius died in  his feast is observed on november  the christians of roman africa comprising the communities of tripoli algeria and morocco contributed greatly to the strength and growth of the church in the first five centuries despite occasional heresy and almost constant contro  versy by  however the church was virtually extinct in africa because of the inroads of the vandals soon followed by the savage mohammedan conquest the moslem territory of north africa has remained closed to christianity ever since missionary efforts in central and southern africa however have been remarkably successful in modern times the first negro bishop afterwards archbishop of the new christian era in africa was most rev joseph kiwanuka when pope pius xii consecrated him in rome on may th  the holy father made it clear that the appointment of africans as bishops was no mere gesture of goodwill or a benign nod to native aspirations in you pope pius said i reestablish the african hierarchy which was interrupted by the invasion of the vandals centuries ago you must work very hard because it is by your success that i shall judge whether or not i should appoint new african bishops while attending the recent council sessions archbishop kiwanuka could look around the conclave and see two african cardinals and more than  african bishops back home in africa were  million catholics and an everincreasing native clergy and sisterhood africas  major seminaries and  minor seminaries were engaged in training the more than  african candidates for the priesthood while still other native sons pursued their studies at rome and at various european seminaries all this was achieved in a relatively short period of ecclesiastical history the man who symbolizes the remark able african catholic progress of his era archbishop kiwanuka died in march of  having served his people for more than  years as parish priest seminary professor bishop and finally archbishop the blood of martyrs being the seed of christians it is not surprising that in uganda where  lay african catholics were martyred  years ago there are now two million catholics in a total population of seven million in our own day the martyrdom of  priests brothers and sisters in the congo representing  religious communities and  nationalities testifies to the intrepid apostolic thrust in modern africa and promises an even greater growth of catholicism on the continent a new era of missionary activity is about to begin in africa declared cardinal laurian rugambwa africas distinguished first cardinal speaking at a symposium in dublin ireland recently though only a small percentage of negroes in the united states are catholic they presently are represented in the episcopate by the auxiliary bishop of new orleans his excellency bishop perry a negro prior was elected in  by the community of st maurs abbey in kentucky conversions to catholicism among the negroes of the u s amount to about   a year the number of negro priests and sisters is advancing steadily the growing prestige among the catholic negroes of the world may well develop to the point where it will produce popes for the universal church once more though that muttering man in new orleans betrayed such a limited knowledge of church history his forecast of the future seems very well founded indeed

this christ shamed us by his pigmentation so obviously not our own he condemned us for our blackness for our flat noses for our kinky hair for our power our strange power of expressing emotion in singing and shouting and dancing he was sedate so genteel so white and as soon as we were able many of us tried to be like him for a growing number of bold young black people all that is past they fling out their declaration no white christ shall shame us again we are glad to be black we rejoice in the darkness of our skin we celebrate the natural texture of our hair we extol the rhythm and vigor of our songs and shouts and dances and if your american christ doesnt like that you know what you can do with him that is black_power a repudiation of the american culturereligion that helped to create it and a quest for a religious reality more faithful to our own experience these young people say to america we know your christ and his attitude toward africa we remember how his white missionaries warned against africas darkness and heathenism against its savagery and naked jungle heart we are tired of all that this africa that you love and hate but mostly fearthis is our homeland we saw you exchange your bibles for our land we watched you pass out tracts and take in gold we heard you teach hymns to get our diamonds and you control them still if this is what your christ taught you he is sharp baby he is shrewd but hes no savior of ours we affirm our homeland and its great black past a past that was filled with wonder before your white scourge came you can keep your christ well take our home that is black_power a search for roots in a land that has denied us both a past and a future and the american christ who has blessed the denial earns nothing but scorn   from black_power and the american christ by vincent harding in the christian century

it was ridiculous to i have an issue of such an insipidly written magazine in the apartment he knew nevertheless he picked it up again and began to read the article written about himself the audacity of it and the incredible and insane arrogance it suggested made him feel helpless against the terrible tide of consciousness so established and so knowledgeable to him and to his people his brains were sealed signed for and delivered like his body would have been in the previous century he focused his eyes and finished the article his black hands and black eyes drooping wearily over the side of the plush gold sofa then he lay down upon it keeping his shoes on it was not very comforting at all the article stated clearly that his childhood dream had been to pursue and to possess a blonde goddess that he could never be happy without her it made fun of a black entertainer he had dated it said he paid her to give him his freedom there was no picture of her but there was a listing and pictures of national and international ladies with fair hair to whom he had been linked romantically at one time or another there was a picture of him with his wifehis wife bright and grinning and his teeth matching her fairness kilometer for kilometer his hair was falling into his eyes it always seemed to be falling into his eyes whenever he was playing golf or driving or dancing or singing and he always had to toss his head give his neck a quick snappy jerk in order to keep his tumbling hair neat it always got into his eyes he bent over to light a cigarette the hair fell into his eyes he used his free hand to brush it back knowing that it would tumble into his eyes again his wife entered the room she was very very white he had asked her to stay out of the sun and the black maid entered with a tray of beverages the children liked the maid and his wife liked the maid he hated her she was almost as black as himself and her hair was short he always felt like singing an old downhome blues whenever he saw her  i dont want no woman if her hair aint no longern mine she aint nothing but trouble and keep you worried all the time but no matter how much hatred he showed towards her the woman was always kind and serene yet there was the very faintest hint of laughter and incredible mockery in her eyes when she looked at him he knew the look he himself had given it to others many times he remembered the party in greenwich village the interracial party with all the loud music and the loud dancing which belonged to a younger time than now l j  there was a colored girl there he was told but all the girls looked of the same race because there was not the brightest lighting still he thought that he would know a sapphire if he saw one the girls white date had laughed at him for saying this and slapped him on the back he had felt so clever so able to take it so free so optimistic so in and that was when he knew that he could make it if he chose to make it in the big world of the american dream and this world as he knew it was not white it was a grey world with room in it for all the people he felt so in that he almost blessed emma lazarus a group of them were laughingly trying to sing a foolish ditty with dirty words they were all so happy and drunk and there was a girl whose hands kept going to her temple and down behind her ears with long locks of hair which she pushed over her shoulder then she would toss her hair or attempt to but the long hair barely moved the long strands did not move freely they seemed waxen stuck around her face like fetters his hands went to his own head in sudden dirision and stuck in the dixie peach the girl swung her head again and caught his eyes he looked into her eyes as deeply as he could and his bitterness spilled like a white sizzle across to her in mockery and despair and a tender compassionate hatred the boy who had slapped him on the back moved toward the girl caught her by the hand and began to dance with her his hips swaying brutally ungraceful in mocknegro he went to the window dawn was moving up to the river and over the roofs it was time for him to go he knew that he would never go to another party with a negro no matter what color the negro wasthey were all embarrassing he might go if he were the only one only if he were jc     he knew that his wife somehow resulted from this promise which he had made to himself a long time ago at the village party he had come a long way his name his picture his life were on the lips and the lifesized posters of the world subway bums whores and dogs could lean against his photograph in most of the worlds  swinging cities and he was very wealthy he had his own entourage of jesters and the best hairdresser in the worldone who kept him well stocked with the best pomade the article in the magazine shouldnt have bothered him so much he told himself it wasnt the first time nor would it be the last he had to pay the price they were requiring it of him and he had to make it he had to keep making it it was too late to stop where would he go there was no place elsewhere but down down to scorn back slowly but certainly to a world which had become alien black strange and nameless the wolves would chew him black back to black indeed never what did it matter the whites had begun their assaults late the blacks had berated him all his life black bastard black bastard bad hair boy get a brush and comparisons almost bunkys color no not quite as black as bunky child i couldnt see nuthin but eyes and teeth i like him sure but my daddy would kill me if i

mothers footstool his mothers freckles her rituals with black and white ointment her straight nose he hated his flat nose all of his pictures were in profile except the one in the magazine in that one all of his black faults were on view in that picture the heat had turned the expensive pomade on his hair to plain and simple shining grease ah chickeneaters of the world unite you have nothing to lose except your shame he began to dress immaculately as always for there was his agent had said a chance to make another million melanin and millions millions and melanin numbly he moved about the dressing room larger than his parents living room had been mutely he dressed dejectedly he faced himself in the mirror silently the green gall of selfrevulsion passed through his psyche and soul swiftly he recalled the chance to make a million and the wife who would spend it on furs jewels fun cosmetics and servants and the whole world would see what black bastards with millions and melanin could do yes they would the agents smooth voice on the phone reassured him about the million there was nothing to reassure him about himself nothing nothing down the stairs voices were shrill suddenly his little girl was sobbing he heard the maid say be quiet youll wake up your mama but cathy said my daddys a nigger monkey what do you care what cathy says and daddy puts gasoline in his hair to make

i always thought so yes i always thought so too numbly he stood there he had to listen the annihilated searching seeking to be terror who had first given assumption and such supreme arrogance to the captives he knew she had read the article which had denied her existence a black female the race and sex which according to them could never move him to love to cherish to desire caldonia caldonia what makes your big head so hard he remembered his boyhood and all the lyrics which laughed at and lamented black womanhood blackness black manhood black childhood black they had made the world for him had set all the traps he had been born to it the horror of blackness they had outdone themselves they had outdone him and it was not meant that he should ever be saved he must believe and they could assume postures and lies and they could believe in his selfhatred and they could rest comfortably believing that he believed and continue their believing they were so arrogant so stupefied by history and circumstances that they could accept any incredible thing they said about him terror who was the bondsman who was the freed man he knew life began to flow again his blood sang vital and red freedom power even yes i am beautiful born black born with no lack decorated bom decorated  at the foot of the stairs he could hear the maid again angrily muttering with dancers feet he moved nearer nearer to hear nearer to self to recovery lies lies lies sometimes we have to lie to make it even to live we got to lie to ourselves to our friends and to our enemies to those we love and to those we hates if they so smart they aint got to bleve us he saw her throw the movie magazine clear down his long sumptuous living room and he heard his little daughter laughing as she went to get the

arrogant uppity folksll believe anything let em pay and pay white bastards what what the child questioned nothing go on to the playroom until i call you for lunch i got to vacuum up this room then he was there standing in the beautiful luxurious room facing the black woman with the short hair humph he heard her say as she turned to push a low red incredulously plush and ridiculously expensive chair aside for her vacuuminghere let me be of service he said never mind let me he said again and gently pushed her aside humph she said again but he got a glimpse of her face which had years of anger and defiance and hope written in chickenscratch wrinkles and crows feet and there was the mockery he always saw there and yet a kindness a laughter which was very sweet and strong and the barest hint of tears in the eyes tears like monuments to despair when he replaced the chairs and kissed his wife and child he said his goodbye to the black woman and sang a snatch of his latest recording as he walked to the elevator he felt lightweightless and yet strong and pretty i feel pretty he thought well not that kind of pretty he mocked himself but it was surprising that he sang for he had promised himself that he was only an entertainer that he wasnt your singing dancing spade that he a professional only wouldnt be caught dead drunk or straitlaced singing off the stage or away from the tv cameras or dancing like some hamhocking gigaboo nevertheless his chauffeur smiled happily when he cut a step from his latest musical sensation as he entered the limousine with the sacrilegious words i feel pretty floating cakewalking from his lips
romanticists are wont to think that the pueblo de nuestra de senora de los angeles was settled by spanish grandees and caballeros sophisticated descendants of the conquisjfi tadores   a close look at the record reveals however that the original founders or pobladores were a motley lot there was not a fullblooded white family among them but they were pioneer stock and with three exceptions they stayed and built the town we know today as los angeles when plans were completed for the envisioned pueblo fernando de rivera y moncada journeyed to mexico to recruit settlers for the town there after a whole year of persuading he succeeded in interesting only  families or  people and of that number only  families or  people actually made the trek majority were negroes the outfitting of the settlers took place at alamos a small town on the mexican mainland not far from the gulf of california seven of the families enlisted at rosario three at sinaloa and one at alamos the small group accompanied by an army contingent set out for their new home on feb   though it is not widely known or emphasized the overwhelming majority of the founders of the pueblo de nuestra senora de los angeles were catholics of negro racial strain of those  pobladores ultimately arriving at the projected site the only people of unmixed caucasian race in the whole community were two spanish men the settlers who represented a mixture of indian and negro with here and there a trace of spanish can be broken down into four racial strainsintermarriage among the latin american natives and europeans produced a multitude of castes children of an indian mother in an indiancaucasian union are considered mestizos whereas those of a negro mother in a negroindian union are classified as mulattos by this enumeration the  founders of los angeles wereif these statistics prove nothing else at least they dispel any notion that there were any blueblooded spanish dons among the catholics who pioneered the city of the angels quite the contrary is the case for there were more negroes among the founders of los angeles than any other racial group and a realization of this factor useful for the social historian confirms that these noble pobladores sprang from hardy stock and the blood of true pioneers coursed through their veins
ne of the virtues of margaret walkers long  pages first novel jubilee houghton mifflin  is its angle of vision the story of vyry the novels heroine is told from the negro viewpoint and since the period covered in the novel spans the years just prior to and just after the civil war this viewpoint alone is a novelty most of the vast catalogue of novels about that period of american history have treated black charactersif at allas animate furniture in the background of the swashbuckling lives of white men and women drawn twice their natural size it should be stated at the outset that jubilee does not turn the traditional civil war novel upsidedown or insideout in approach in insight and in its tone it clings to the familiar in fact jubilee flings aside one of the brighter robes of the traditional civil war novel it is almost totally lacking in romance but perhaps this fact was dictated by the novelists choice of heroine vyry miss walker informs us in a brief dedication in the book was actually margaret duggans ware brown the authors maternal greatgrandmother and it is possible that the sheer weight of the actual and of the need to keep within the bounds of careful research and credibility served to rob the narrative of romance in many ways vyrys story is the saga of the negros long hard bitter travail in this land she was born a slave and when mr lincolns eman cipation came she journeyed forth into a hostile world where those who had been her masters still ruled determined that emancipation notwithstanding black people would never stand equal beside them vyry is not of course the negro woman of her era to begin with she is the child of her master born to sis hetta the frail concubine of marse dutton at  sis hetta died in childbirth having given marse dutton  slaves for his fields and kitchens vyry grows up as a house nigger despised by her masters wife and ignored by her masterfather she is the particular servant of miss lillian who also is her sister the arrangement of course was far more common during those days than historians find it comfortable to admit love never comes to vyry sex does randall ware the coalblack free black man in dawson ga the town nearest the dutton plantations comes acourting and two children jim and minnaare born of that union ware though a prosperous blacksmith cannot purchase vyrys freedom and his one effort to lead her to freedom by way of the underground railroad is thwarted for her efforts vyry is beaten and lashed into unconsciousness but vyry is a true house nigger having assumed all the airs and prejudices of her calling and she has little taste for daring the war breaks out and ware goes north to offer his services to the invading yankee armies marse dutton dies and both the dutton son and soninlaw die in the fighting the ruin of the dutton family is complete when old missy dies and miss lillian following an assault by men in shermans army goes off her rocker faithful vyry stands by her demented mistress until relatives arrive from alabama to take the unfortu nate woman and her two children away then vyry marries innis brown a black man who turned up with shermans troops and stayed as her suitor after all randall ware has been away seven years and vyry has waited for him in vain now wed vyry and her family begin their trek across the rural south seeking a place to settle where the rampaging ku klux klan will let them live in peace all the forces of nature and bigotry contrive against them they are flooded out of one home exploited into poverty in another and burned out of a third finally in alabama vyry wins respect as a midwife and the whites permit her and her family to go their way then finally randall ware shows up again prosperous and forgiving providing for the education of his two children the book ends on this note it would be a pleasure to report that jubilee is the longawaited novel which tells the black mans story of that crucial period of conflict over slavery in this land but such unhappily is not the case miss walker has failed in her reach for the epic novel she has even failed to write a very interesting novel which is worse in the authors favor it might be said that she was overwhelmed by her material from a mass of information and history it was her task to weave a background for the story of vyry brown so much of that story is told in language that is surprisingly banal for a poet of miss walkers reputation and none of the sweep and turbulence of the civil war is captured or even suggested in her style the novel reads as though the author felt that her first duty was to provide the everyday details of vyrys life that in performing this duty the vast panorama of history would fall into place behind
