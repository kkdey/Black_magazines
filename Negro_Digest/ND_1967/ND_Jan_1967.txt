 curious aspect of cp i q the struggle of black  i people in america for a human rights is that generally we have assumed that economic exploitation and racism are one and the same thing they are not for instance the system of bondservitude which existed in america within the white race was a system of exploitation but not of racism and in europe animosity between the french and the germans could be termed racism but there is now no exploitation involved very often racism and exploitation are found in the same place at the same timeas in todays americabut a study of history will show that in most cases the exploitation of a race or nation began first and was then followed by a racist doctrine which rationalized that exploitation the spanish did not invade the south america of the nonwhite incas because they were racists but because they wanted the wealth of what was so pompously called the new world the slave traders of europe would not have bothered to invade africa in the name of racism alone the white world needed a source of cheap labor and raw materials in both cases and to varying degrees racism came later even so most of our leaders continue to treat the two facts of the life of black people in america as one and as a matter of fact attack racism more vehemently than they do economic exploitation what other reason exists why our leaders do not call for a nationwide boycott of all luxury products for black people to buy the necessities of life only from blackowned stores to boycott christmas itself in all but the spiritual and religious sense to boycott the automobile industry for a year or more or to form societies just as have the chinese to buy land and to open businesses it is because most of our leaders believe that if we can force the white man to give up his racism he will automatically cease to exploit us this is a ridiculous idea who is more exploited than a white mississippi who dies in vietnam defending an economic system that has given him nothing but a substandard education a sharecrop farm cheap clothes and too little to eat to the true exploiter of american society the big white man race means nothing he exploits his own as quickly and with no more conscience than he exploits black people  but still our leaders accept the idea that racism and exploitation are the sameor worse that racism is the greater evil and to the extent that they accept this idea they have accepted the white mans definition of the black mans problem the big white man is no doubt very pleased about this he is very content to allow the black man to look after his eternal soul or to attack it just as long as the black man leaves his purse alone a perfect example of the confusion between racism and economic exploitation is our relationship with the white liberal especially in our condemnations of him i have read a good many of these by people of varying degrees of anger boiled down they state in effect that the white liberals liberalism is insincere that he helps us because he is inadequate in the white world and believing us to be inferior feels that he will be more than adequate in the black world or that he is a man who is racked by guilt over his racism and hopes not to face his true nature by throwing himself into the black mans struggle or finally that he is a big white man who has been exploiting black people as slum landlord or seller of inferior merchandise and gives his money for his consciences sake the last is one of the few valid condemnations but it should not be made our leaders should accept his money and use it to finance the black struggle but all the rest those in which not money but only the white liberals work in our behalf though actually on a superficial levelmiss the main point they assume that good white liberals do exist people who truly want to integrate black people into american society or who want to obliterate all consciousness of race in both the black and white man very seldom do these condemnations deal with the white liberals true feelings on exploitation the white liberal tells us that he is opposed to the exploitation of black people and we assume that he is opposed to all forms of exploitation in most cases he is not beware of the man who opposes only certain forms of exploitation as i have said the big white man does not care about the race of the people he exploits he is realistic is committed mainly to keeping things as they are change itself is his worst enemysince change means that he must make adjustments in his economic behavior that he must take risks notice for example how the stock market is effected by the change of presidents in the same way any change in the situation of black people either for better or worse would call for a corresponding change by the big white man to balance our attempts to bring about change the big white man uses americas white lowerclass some of them avowed racists who at worst call openly for our destruction and at least for a continuance of our present condition but at heart the lowerclass white has only so much power as the big white man gives him from time to time to retard our progress however committed to keeping things as they are the big white man does not allow the lowerclass white to go as far as he wants this may not always be so as more and more of the nonwhite world takes back the land and resources the big white man in europe and america has controlled for the last several hundred years and as automation diminishes the need for cheap labor the big white man will have to cut production the day is coming when he will no longer need black people to produce or to consume but for the time being we are safe he needs us all black man and lowerclass white most of our leaders believe that the lowerclass white is our worst enemy but at very least his racism does not involve any great exploitation of us and does not grow out of his whiteness as our angrier leaders believe but rather out of his competition with us within the american economy his fear is not that we will rape or worse marry his daughter but that we will take his job it is not even our concern tht he feels us to be ineror as a matter of fact it has worked to our advantage and will continue to do so a man who thinks his enemy is inferior is very likely to underestimate his enemys power and determination his supposed superiority will disarm him at this point we must see how the white liberal fits into this pattern he is not usually a white of the lowerclass but of the middleclass to some extent this explains why he does not ally himself with the lowerclass white within the white world he must stay on the good side of the big white man for he hopes one day to be one himself basically he joins us not because he is committed to equality but because the lowerclass white is the one who most threatens his middleclass position in white american society the fight against racism supplies an outlet for his liberalism necessary to his belief in the american system within which he or his father has achieved middleclass membership at the same time he protects himself against the rise of the lowerclass white at least one of his many beliefs which he must maintain to justify his wanting to join the big white man is that the big white man is ignorant of his exploitation of black people the big white man he tells us is sensitive intelligent moral and honest despite these qualities he does not know what he has done to black people in america for the last  years as soon  as he does know he will stop but a system of exploitation as refined and efficient as americas is certainly not the product of generations of ignorant men all the above would seem enough for us to handle for a long time if our leaders saw the situation as one of economic exploitation and formulated plans for us which would attack the weaknesses in the economic system but unfortunately they see the situation as one of racism and by assuming this our leaders accept the doctrine of white supremacy have i gone too far let us look for example at the black integrationist doesnt he instruct the black man to integrate himself economically socially and psychologically into american society in terms of economic integration just as he is now the black man is already integrated into the american economy which benefits from him as a consumer and when he can find a job as a worker even when he is not working he is used as a threat against the white worker thus within the economy the black man has a very definite function the black integrationist is not talking about true social integration either since he does not call for a total mixture of the races to create a new nonwhite race thus he is talking only about psychological integration but he is not calling upon the white man to become either totally or in part psychologically black he is calling upon the black man to become totally or partially white but as long as he is black the black man cannot become psychologically white his black skin gives him a set of experiences which will continue to make him black psychologically by calling upon the black man to integrate himself into american society the black integrationist can only mean that despite his black skin and his black experience the black man must become as white and as american as possible he is also asking the black man to ignore and renounce all that has and will happen to him until the day of total integration in order to do this the black man must ignore his total experience since with black skin he has had no white experience a man is his total experience to renounce it is to renounce himself totally why does the black integrationist call upon the black man to make this sacrifice so that he might be integrated totally into and be treated as a human member of american society the black integrationist then can only mean that to the extent that he is black the black man is not a human being and at most because of his black skin he can never be more than almost human if this is not white supremacy what indeed is white supremacy even most of our angrier leaders are white supremacists they begin from the premise that the white man is evil not because he exploits black people but because he is white they reason to be white is to be evil whiteness breeds racism which leads to exploitation therefore they ask us to separate ourselves from the evil of whiteness which will free us from the white mans exploitation this is a little better for it senses that the black man can best alleviate exploitation by remaining separated from american society but because their argument is directed against whiteness itself instead of exploitation it still leads to an acceptance of white supremacy for if the white man is evil because he is white his power over us must flow from his whiteness it follows he was able to dominate and exploit us because of the power of whiteness thus our very blackness is responsible for our condition it could not stand up to the evil power of whiteness if we separate from himthat is if we do not try to weaken the power of his whiteness with our blacknesshe will continue to be able to exploit us for the power of his whiteness is undiminished doesnt such an argument support the doctrine of white supremacy separation is indeed the answer not to flee the evil of whiteness but to create an economic unit which can bring an end to exploitation suppose for example the tenants of a slumbuilding in harlem formed a corporation to buy the building in which they lived then suppose more and more tenements were bought by the black people who lived in them until all of the buildings in harlem were owned by the people of harlem manhattan island is the most important island in the world harlem is almost half of manhattan island what if black people owned half of the most important island in the world and still most of our leaders and the majority of black people are committed to the integration movement and accept with that commitment the doctrine of white supremacy still the majority of black people trust the white liberal and even in their condemnations of him emphasize his whiteness or his hidden racism still the majority of black people accept the idea that even though some white liberals are insincere there do exist some good white liberals there is no such thing as a good white liberalnot because of the evil of whiteness but because of the evil of the concept of liberalism itself malcolm_x once said of all our studies history is best qualified to reward our research in order to understand the evil of liberalism we must find where it has appeared before and what were its end results we must find a people whose situation was similar to ours and see what happened to them at the hand of liberalism within the last  years there has been such a  people the jews of germany during the nazi era i realize that by introducing the inflammatory issue of the jewish people i risk being misunderstood very often our leaders are asked if black people are antisemitic they have a hard time answering because antisemitism is a racist concept fighting racism they hate to admit they themselves are racist but again the relationship of jews to black people is primarily not one of racism but of exploitation in america there is a pecking order of exploitation the big white man exploits both jew and middleclass white manindeed everybody the middleclass white man exploits the lowerclass white man in the black ghetto the jew tends to be the one who exploits the black man so in raising the question of the jew in germany it is important that we understand that the comparison is drawn in terms of exploitation not in terms of racism though racism as we will see certainly appears for centuries the jews of europe and particularly of germany had been victims of exploitation and racism even so they were allowed to function within the economy of europe the rothchilds come to mind but not until the nazi era did germany and europe adopt the policy of geno cide the extermination of the jewish race and it is an interesting and important historical fact that the nazism in germany grew not out of the monarchy of kaiser wilhelm but instead from the most liberal government germany ever had the german republic it took only  years from the time of its formation in  for hitler to rise through the legislative process to the chancellorship of the republic that this could happen within a liberal framework points to the evil of the liberal concept itself which is irrational despite all racial religious cultural and physical differences all men are the same for the german liberal this meant that even though the jew was a jew under his jewishness he was a german the german liberal was thus committed to the creation of a society in which the jews germanity could emerge but the jews jewishness was a fact not as is black skin besides most jews did not want to give up their jewishness beyond this the jews jewishness just as the black mans skin gave him a set of experiences which continued to make him jewish and to the same extent nongerman thus the jew by daring to want to remain a jew in fact by being jewish was the main obstacle to a liberal germany at this point the german liberal had to make a crucial decision he could either accept the jew as a jew not as a german with certain jewish characteristics and abandon his dream of a society where all men were completely german or he could continue to pursue his dream but a close look at the german liberal reveals that he was not committed to integrating jews into german society as much as he was committed to the ideal of uniformity such dreams die hard the german liberal frustrated in his attempts to germanize the jew saw the salvation of his dream of uniformity in hitlers call for the extermination of the jews only when there were no more jews would everybody be truly german the german liberal cast his lot with hitler all situations have an economic base in this case the real exploiters of germany were pleased by this development their power was being threatened by the lowerclass german who was calling for an end to his exploitation and was joining the communists in great numbers in germany the liberal helped to redirect the mind of the lowerclass german away from his own exploitation the jew became a scapegoat for the misery of the lowerclass german i need only add that the german republic was formed after germany had lost world war one which brought on the collapse of the german economy i trust i do not have to draw out the comparison to great lengths clearly the white liberal committed to the dream of american uniformity does not accept the black man as he is we cannot risk discovering what he will do when he finds out that his dream cannot be made a reality as long as black people exist in america one more thing at this time america is fighting a war which it cannot seem to win decisively and which if lost will bring about drastic changes with which the big white man will have to deal earlier i quoted malcolm_x on the value of studying history i did not give the quotation fully in the next breath he continued and when you see that youve got a problem all you have to do is examine the historic method used all over the world by others who have problems similar to yours i think malcolm_x would have also taught us that even before we can discover what other people did about their problems we must first be certain we know the true nature of our own problem and that while we look for the solution we should be careful to avoid the mistakes made by people who faced similar problems especially at the end of his life malcolm_x knew all of this i think that is why returning from mecca he told us that he no longer believed our problem to be solely one of race but of human rights and of exploitation it would be a great shame now that he is dead if we moved backwards from the point to which at times very much against our will he had pushed us
in february  the southern college students took matters i q into their own hands changing the nature of civil_rights £ strategy since then the civil_rights question has been a  g major domestic concern in the united states and headline news throughout the world sympathizers with the civil_rights movement have generally been impressed by the concept of a moral cause which has given rise to a modern great crusade theirs has been the sublime conviction of eventual victory so much so that they have paid little attention to the course and direction of the everyday struggle examination of the current situation however reveals that despite the marches large and small despite the sitins wadeins and other nonviolent protest demonstrations despite the considerable toll of human sacrificethe civil_rights revolt is in mortal danger in fact the civil_rights revolt is well on its way to defeat through the first two phases of the revolt february  to the march on washington august  and the second phase the counterrevolution august  to the present the civil righters have been severely crippled by three primary weaknesses which have contributed to their present difficulty i the civil righters have never known the nature » of the problem nor the nature of the enemy ii the civil righters have lacked the necessary institutions and apparatus to achieve their objective iii the civil righters have not projected a clear view either of the society as it is or the society as it ought to be any single one of these weaknesses would be enough to frustrate any reform attempt with these three basic weaknesses the civil_rights reform movement is doomed to isolation frustration and annihilation the moderate civil righters will settle for tokens as they always have the conservative civil righters will have to be happy with status without substance while the tactics of the civil righters have been dramatic their tactics have essentially depended on the open bestiality and blind stupidity of sheriffs state troopers and elected officials to this date the civil righters have not developed and in some instances have not wished to develop a stable disciplined massbased power organization determined to deal with the problems of the black people of this land the past two years have merely borne out the accuracy of joseph p lyfords observation that the term revolution or revolt when applied to the current efforts of the negro middleclass to secure rights and privileges commensurate with their class status has been a serious misnomer without doubt the negro middleclass has dominated much of the current effort and has disguised its class goals to give the appearance that its efforts were racial in nature rather than class oriented at best these valiant efforts are a conservative reform movement a reform whose goals are pictured in terms of the verbalized but not the actual creed of the society in attempting such a class reform under the guise of racial reform the leaders and followers of this movement have indicated that they understand neither the racial problem nor the nature of the society for the past  years scholars have been suggesting that the race problem in america is a special type of the ageold colonial problem and as such is a racial problem that is a problem at the root of the society the problem is a hybrid outgrowth of both the basic european bourgeois racist attitude of contempt and the societys own organizational and industrial structure in contrast to this view the negro bourgeoisie conservative by training and conditioning has insisted through most of its recent history that the racial problems of the united states are purely a domestic issue this class has looked for the explanation of the behaviour and motivation of the dominant white society in every directionsave economic and cultural premises assumptions of europe and europeans the struggle of this class against racist exploitation has now developed into a fight against individual bigotry and intolerance blinded by this basic fallacy and misled in their beliefs that there was a possibility of even political equality under the present system the negro middleclass has tried to peddle the idea that the white middleclass was in favor of rights for negroes this lack of a realistic modern orientation has brought profoundly limiting consequences the reformers insist on the passage of legalistic but generally unenforceable regulations they are overly concerned with the maintenance of a good image rather than the attainment of solid objectives and are forever calling upon the federal government to intervene on behalf of black citizens in trouble civil righters particularly the more conservative ones continually issue solemn declarations of domesticity to reassure the society according to these declarations negroes will maintain their nonviolent posture and not look anywhere in the world for insight information and support recently roy wilkins executive secretary of the naacp issued such a statement when he said that the naacp was opposed to the peace demonstration to be held august   mr wilkins stated that naacp was opposed because the official word is that there will be a civil disobedience attempt to crash into the white house and another attempt to occupy the chamber and desks of the house of representatives he and his organization would not be party to such a thing in effect the older line groups have been thwarting the development of the civil_rights cause by keeping the struggle isolated to one single issue the younger more radical civil righters as well have been affected by this kind of thinking or nonthinking many of these young people want a quick decision since their cause is right and they have exposed the cancerous nature of societys inner life b the people the leadership and followers of the civil_rights cause generally do not understand the mass of white society since the civil righters and the negro middleclass interpret their efforts as a holy crusade they were unprepared for the response that has developed since the march on washington in  blinded by a deep liberal and religious tradition few have acknowledged that since october  the path of the civil righters has been blocked by a veritable wall of white emotion lou harris reported that the negro ibm tabulators were unprepared surprised frightened and overwhelmed by the race hatred expressed in the responses of a representative cross section of the white population the responses were so shocking that these negro ibm tabulators threatened to resign in the midst of the mammoth task at this writing the feelings of white society have not changed appreciably in some instances the conflict has exacerbated and intensified negative feelings of whites and group activity and corporate action has replaced individual white hostility and prejudice white friends and allies of the negro struggle whether liberal or radical have unwittingly contributed to the lack of understanding of the true nature of the feelings of the overwhelming number of whites the whites who for whatever reason have sided with the negro represent a valiant but small percentage of the white group and their voices have been drowned out by the booming shouts of anger and hatred by the vast majority not only did the civil righters fail to understand the white community but they also demonstrated an appalling ignorance of the black communityits wants needs goals and aspirations the civil righters have constantly dealt in abstract ideals in religious and moral slogans without ever getting down to bread and butter issues harris and other pollsters repeatedly realize that a broad section of the negro lower class either were lying in their answers or were not even included in the tabulations the negro middleclass in the polls revealed an inexhaustible craving for acceptance and love the civil righters have attempted to convert the bulk of the population to a new set of values this attempt at conversion speaks a deeply religious motivation further it ignores the deep suffering within the black community it is misguided since this society is both driven and secular while the civil righters may continue to sing their myth of hope we shall overcome the truth is that their assessment of the attitudes of the bulk of the population was a gross miscalculation of the true feelings of the american people about basic political realities for since the birth of this nation the concept of democracy to most people has meantfor whites only in short the civil righters and their sympathizers have never known the problem or the nature of the problem they are trying to solve or the people that they are trying to convert by and large the civil righters have never questioned the values of a society which could first enslave the negro turn him loose without freeing him keep him in his place by racism and then threaten to do away with that very place by automation and technological change to call this limited reform movement a revolt or revolution is patently absurd above all else this reform essentially lacks a relevant point of view h no institutions no apparatus men pursue their goals through institutions whatever gains the civil_rights reform movement has made have been the product of maximum human spontaneity and very limited institutional apparatus since  the civil_rights movement has only produced two organizations of a national character the student nonviolent coordinating committee and the northern student movement some of the civil_rights activists have shown a disenchantment and marked hostility for all structures and formal organizations preferring to substitute personal zeal and commitment for planning and group execution at times much of this type of spontaneity has almost resembled anarchy a number of strong local adhoc groups have grown and been supported but by and large the revolution has not developed any distinguished regional or national revolutionary apparatus a number of new local leaders have gained experience and prominence in leading the demonstrations yet there is still a lack of administrative skills necessary to sustain ongoing projects and programs the leaders of this society have wisely not seen fit to recognize or deal with the new activist groups instead the leaders of this society have continued to deal with the oldline civil_rights organizations whom themselves are instruments of whitepower interests this willingness on the part of the local power structures to negotiate with the oldline groups has necessarily strengthened the hand of the traditional groups like the naacp and the urban league in strengthening the position of the oldline black establishment the leaders of the society have with little effort slowed the thrust of the civil_rights forces in exchange for the recognition and money tokens of the white society the traditional negro groups and many of the moralists have been willing to continue the fiction of a moral issue and decry the use of all radical approaches to solve the racial problem a radical problem the moralists have counselled peace moderation and progress the exchange has been profitable for both partiesthe leaders of the society and the negro traditional groups fair exchange is certainly no robbery one incident of this nature occurred in the community of rochester new york the ministers of that community had brought in saul alinsky community organizer extraordinary to organize the negro community in a peaceful direction to avoid a repetition of the  riots the local businessmen countered by raising  to start an urban league chapter in that city the urban league is constantly praised as the ideal responsible organization no one says for whom this organization is ideal or to whom it is responsible the national urban league has become the middleclass link between the negro revolution and the white power structure and there is widespread evidence to support this claim the league function has been that of a successful mediator for which it receives the social welfare tokens of white american philanthropy in the name of racial progress on the other hand the naacp has been very ready to denounce all procedures as racial postures or radical maneuvers the city fathers of rochester were reportedly most happy to seize upon the statement of roy wilkins executive secretary of national headquarters naacp that rochester had made great strides in correcting its discriminatory practices mr wilkins in particular has been unusually responsible to the best interests of the entire american community the white power interests so zealous were his efforts that the liberator magazine interpreted his posture as indicative of racial selfhate which aided and abetted this oppressive society although the white society looks continually to the naacp and the urban league it has remained apparent for some years that neither group speaks for the rank and file of negro americans the very style of the negro establishment the unofficial name for the traditional groups exerts a tremendous pressure towards conformity and uniformity and therefore active conservatism the pronouncement of these groups have been militant but their behaviour has been conservative the battle cry of the establishment throughout the revolt is a confession of its ideological bankruptcy and programatic poverty deal with us or the radicals will take over deal with us or there will be a long hot summer these are two often heard themes not only is the style of the civil_rights groups conservative but the groups themselves are often not related to the masses it was not until the summer of  that martin_luther_kings southern christian leadership conference group began work on the grassroot level sclc attempted to organize the rural inhabitants of a county in alabama and dr_king the organizations charismatic leader made a number of forays into northern urban ghettos the student nonviolent coordinating committee fortunately has had a long history of working with the people on the grassroots level other adhoc local groups have attempted to unionize the workers even the domestics and the sharecroppers the dominant oppresive society has responded with hostility to such efforts the traditional civil_rights groups are often only passingly familiar with the hopes desires and aspirations of the black people this lack of familiarity with the problems of the masses plus the apparent lack of relevant ideas gives rise to repeated cries that the negro leadership should be democratized the institutions which these undemocratized leaders head are similarly unresponsive and unimaginative the performance of the negro institutions has all but left the negro revolt without adequate institutional channels through which it can confront the dominant oppressive society without adequate channels and with slumbering and fumbling leadership of the existing apparatus negro revolt or discontent has no avenue through which it might work this lack of a workable avenue gives rise to the frequently heard question is protest to become an end in itself
no clear dream or goal we shall overcome and freedom now are important slogans of the present racial efforts as inspiring and emotionally buying as these chants may be these selfsame slogans hardly hide the fact that the negro revolt as it is termed has not projected a vision of what the society is or what the society ought to be only the muslims and the nationalists to their credit have projected a dream of a better community their dream is an allblack or in some sophisticated circles a multiracial society with the borrowed concept of a profound redistribution of resources economic and political power and a rejection of the present white mass middleclass cultures corruption and hypocrisy even the view of some of the muslims or nationalists sometimes sounds more like a wish to replace white capitalism by a form of black capitalism a replacement of the uncolored decadence by a colored variety of that same poisonous social decadence the civil righters cold hard realists that they are have no dream they use a slogan instead for a dream they substitute a hodgepodge of emotional slogans and individual demands and issue disoriented protests slogans like we shall overcome and freedom now as used by the traditional civil_rights moralists hardly disguise the fact that the plans and goals projected by the civil_rights leadership are essentially colorless dreams and fantasies unrelated to the situation of the rank and file of negroes today instead the dreams are related to white middleclass liberal aspirations even the widely heralded i have a dream speech of dr martin_luther_king jr projected a goal for the american society as a whole while verbalizing the negro middleclass fantasies of integration and eventual assimilation lou harris polls of july  and february  revealed that to the rank and file negro the goals of the revolt were private individual hopes each hope represented the personal price for which the individual might be willing to settle when closely examined the sellout prices revolved about the consumeroriented status tokens of white middleclass society try as they might the civil_rights leaders because they didnt know where they were why they were there in the first place or where they were going wouldnt or better yet couldnt present a plan for negroes of various classes and stations the civil righters were indeed happy even grateful that the poverty program was proposed to handle some of the pressing problems of the lowerclass negro and some of the mobility problems of the negro middleclass even the staunchest civil righters cannot suggest that the poverty program is a serious answer to inequality yet by default this poverty war is their only real proposal the ability of a people to dream for that in reality is what a utopia is about is a sign of hope and an affirmation of life for a group to lack this power to dream or to be unable to construct a utopian model is an admission of a deep sense of powerlessness on the part of that group no utopias have been projected by the civil righters the fact that the entire negro freedom movement has failed to project a goal is another index of the powerlessness of the movement itself save for those small groups who have begun the long tortuous road to community organization and community development the negro freedom movement without model or goal is marching ever marching without knowing from whence it came or where it goes with such unchartered course however all movement can be considered progress all change seems to be beneficial all activity no matter how poorly conceived becomes desirable activity is essential because it obscures the vacuum which exists in the thinking and planning of the civil righters themselves the movement of the past six years therefore has been a generally unsuccessful attempt to substitute motion for thought it has been an attempt to make an unwilling society live up to its verbalizations of brotherhood of man freedom and democracy the revolutionaries have not questioned the values of the society merely some of its practices it is safe to conclude that from its beginning the negro reform movement without relevant point of view nor adequate institutions nor a goal has been doomed to real but not apparent failure revolutions begin in the minds of men a slave is one who will not do his own thinking the negro reform movement is a product of the hearts and feet of men the reform movement has not captured the minds of men primarily because it has not aimed at their minds instead the reform has been directed towards mens hearts the reform movement has assumed that it is possible to  find freedom and equality under the current economic and social system  integrate ones way out of a system of inequality  involve the federal government meaningfully in the protection of the constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizenship the reformers have placed great faith in ageless promises of democracy human dignity and the value of personality furthermore the civil righters have felt that this society meant to provide a piece of the action to the blacks negroes have never understood that they themselves were the action the main target in a classic game of exploitation after five years some persons have slowly begun to recognize that legal citizenship guarantees do not apply to the rank and file negroes and that those citizenship guarantees that the middleclass negro groups have apparently secured are never assured there is a need therefore not for a mere change of tactics but for a reexamination of the struggle its direction its premises and assumptions such a reassessment must occur before the voterregistrationlaw euphoria has fully set in for while many hail the passage of the  voterrights bill few have seriously questioned the primary assumption of that legislation viz that once the right to vote is secured the negro will stand on the threshold of winning his other rights the truth is that after six years of effort although the negros position has improved politically somewhat in every other sphere his life situation has become even more precarious than it was in employment exploitation has given way to automated uselessness his housing condition deteriorates steadily and housing segregation is steadily increasing the negro family trembles and rocks under successive economic shock waves migration from the farm overcrowds the already bursting ghettos and their facilities middleclass negroes and white liberals in their zest to reform have talked of significant progress changing the negros image and trying to meet the need of the present with programs out of the past designed to help persons in the distant future instead of paying attention to the work of the social and political scientists the negro has just ignored the facts and continued waging his moral crusade in placing trust in the moralist the middleclass negro with his allies has revealed that the negro does not wish to be a free man for six years the negro and his allies have been dreaming screaming shouting marching sittingin wadingin lyingin to be a part of a white racist society which has decreed that it will not treat him either as a free man or as an equal human being still the negro has pursued this goal with determination zeal and tenacity the past years have therefore been merely a prelude to a creative and forceful action to defeat racism a prelude of unrequited love unrewarded suffering and unbelievable naivete a prelude to meaningful preception conception and action which must procede any major social change if this period has been a prelude then impatient negroes must learn to accept the fact that some men learn very slowly indeed if on the other hand the civil_rights forces and their leaders continue along the same path then what is prelude for the negro people marks the finale for the current negro leaders
i learned a new word the other day jj underclass evidently a it means poor folks «ccznc£ thirty years ago most of us were called working class we didnt mind that and a few of us even liked it working class had a sturdy independent sound then it became a dirty word the people with jobs who made enough money graduated to the middleclass and now we leftovers are the underclass and nobody is supposed to like that we dont have enough money we are told because we lack motivation education skills influence and some of us are the wrong color our wellintentioned friends who discovered us want to help us get out of this underclass as fast as we can to give us a handup into their middleclass at the risk of seeming ungrateful to these good white liberals lets stop a bit to look around before we start to scramble out it may look different to us down here than it does to the white liberal in his neat mortgaged little house in the suburbs first who are we i am an underclass white woman who refuses to identify with or aspire to middleclass values and i presume to speak for that minority with underclass values as well as pocketbooks most of the black people in the ghetto are defined by their incomes as near or among the underclass and their separate subculture is recognized being white i know that i cannot speak for the black underclass but perhaps i am permitted to speak about my harlem neighbors perhaps white as i am i may look with them from out of the ghetto at what our betters expect us to scramble for and imitate for to me the black ghetto is the last great reservoir of dignity and courage and humanity and to it i have turned for refuge now let us look up into the suburb down here we can afford the time to live when we are through work we can laugh and play and be kind really completely and i dont think you in the suburbs can ever relax enough to do that once you start scrambling with everyone else there in the suburb for a bigger salary a bigger house and a bigger mortgage the scrambling must take every bit of you every minute of your lives we can stand up to the boss instead of cringing before him we can be decent and fair to our fellow humans instead of trying to climb on their backs or slit their throats we can have friends because they are friends and not just the right people to cultivate we can be and do what we want because we are not living to impress our neighbors all this of course is mixed up with a lot of frustration and misery and wed like to sort it out please sometimes you even say your suburb is a great kind of nonliving it seems so to a few of us we like your suburb but not the way you live in it about ten years ago i had two  underclass sons in high school in a suburban and farming community the school undertook to roll them out and stamp out two middleclass boys just like the millions of gingerbread boys that are coming off our high school assembly lines every year it failed and at times the boys resistance to the rolling and stamping process became conscious rebellion the school administration was piqued because they didnt turn out for athletics it wasnt patriotic the boys were too busy raising cattle running our farm working parttime and participating in activities of their own choice to oblige the administration they wore jeans to school by preference and necessity they enjoyed some of the subjects but they came to despise the conformity and hypocrisy that undergirded the school they learned many things not in the curriculum for my younger son the first lesson came shortly after he entered school a larger older boy a prominent athlete began picking on him it seemed to be working up to a fight one day passing each other in the hall the athlete made an obscene gesture to my son he replied with bastard the athlete cursed him back and my son punched him they were exchanging blows when the viceprincipal came along stopped the fight and demanded an explanation my son told the truth expecting equal punishment the athlete denied making the dirty gesture and blamed my son for starting the fight the viceprincipal believed him my son concluded since the man couldnt be that stupid that the official favored the big boy because he was a prominent athlete my older son had a stimulating civics course in which the students examined various forms of government including communism during the mccarthy hysteria the teacher was run out of the school by local american legion pressure he took a position at a junior college the boys brother taking the course two years later found a timorous little man teaching platitudes and avoiding the study of controversial material the boy spent the semester needling the teacher was he afraid to think about anything that happened after the nineteenth century one night the boys came home excited and angry they had been with a group of students at a drivein that evening when the police came looking for a gang that wasnt there the police told the students to clear out two other underclass brothers were slow to move along a cop came up from behind and banged their heads together not realizing who it was one of the brothers whirled quickly and swung at the cop the cop began clubbing him and his brother jumped the cop both boys were arrested one was a student the other out of school with a police record the policeman had a reputation for brutality with teenagers i shared my sons indignation and agreed with their determination to stand by the arrested boys the school administration cooperated with the police in preparing a case against the boys it called in prominent students and rehearsed with them a story of sinister gangs in the school the throng that congregated casually on the steps there were no organized gangs my older son testified for the defendants we reached a concensus its rotten but stay in school and out of trouble one beautiful spring day a spontaneous mass vacation from school occurred that included not only the usual truants but prominent students from good families my younger son then in his last year joined the exodus the next day the students returned to school with their excuses evidently it had really been an unaccountable epidemic of illness my son reported to the office to get back into school wheres your excuse i havent any he replied the administrator admitted him for the day only the next morning the boy was again in the office wheres your excuse i havent any i tell you and i wont have any my mother wont lie for me the boy was severely punished with endless hours to make up after school the other students excuses were blandly accepted we learned of this incident from a teacher after both my sons were through school one afternoon a janitor was driving away from the school when missiles began thumping the top of his car looking up he saw two boys tossing empty beer cans from an upperfloor window he returned to investigate found the boys drunk in an empty classroom and notified the school authorities the boys were not punished the entire affair was hushed up and the janitor was warned not to make something out of it at peril to his job one of the boys was the son of a local banker and school board member among the teachers my sons had a few good friends who liked and understood them underclassness and all encouraged by his english and drama teachers my younger son decided to apply for admission to the state university which his older brother was by that time atnding he went to the office for   the proper form the guidance officer refused him the form urging instead that he enroll at a junior college for vocational training in mechanicsobviously more appropriate for an underclass youngster in jeans the boy was not interested and  was indignant i wrote an acid note to the counselor indicating my contempt for his values the boys english teacher persuaded him not to deliver the note but she encouraged him to insist on the admission blank he finally got it  shortly after this the boy and the english teacher were discussing the recipient of the best local scholarship to the university hell never make it the boy predicted hes an applepolisher who knows how to make himself look good and thats why the faculty chose him but hes dumb the scholarship winner flunked out the first year so my sons managed to get through high school without the rolling and stamping two oddlooking figures among the gingerbread boys that came off the assembly line the most important lessons of those years were not accredited that in the middleclass world one need pay only lip service to truth honor and goodness that the search for knowledge is better confined safely to noncontroversial subjects that the price of middleclass success would be their nonconformity that integrity and selfrespect are expensive commodities to be jettisoned in the scramble that the smooth plausible surface is infinitely more important than the right or wrong underneath whatever of morality they learned was outside ofand in spite ofthe school these were white boys therefore they were taught had they been black boys in a ghetto school they would not have been taught and there would have been little pressure to conform to middleclass values black youngsters didnt need to know about being middle class for they didnt belong there anyway now our wellintentioned white friends who want to haul us up out of the underclass propose to break up the ghetto schools and teach the black boys give them as good an education as all those little gingerbread boys rolling out of our high schools every spring have received it is assumed the black boys will be grateful this is why their parents have been demonstrating and boycotting segregated schools most white educators recognize a subculture exists in the negro community their conception of it varies to some the underclass ghetto is filled with irresponsible primitives given to music dancing sex and cutting their neighbors a few concede the loyalty and lack of competitiveness of the ghetto are virtues but i doubt if any of them have gone grocery shopping on a saturday afternoon in a certain small supermarket in harlem it is negromanaged and almost entirely negrostaffed i preferred it to the larger lowerpriced white supermarkets in the area because the customers were treated like neighbors instead of colonials the aisles are narrow the store crowded the carts begin to look like a downtown traffic jam half a dozen customers are lined up waiting to have vegetables weighed but for all the confusion and delay he people are gracious and goodhumored the inevitable small collisions become matters for genuine concern and apology the woman at my check stand has a real smile and the box boy a high school student is full of friendly small talk i contrast this to the cool perfunctory politeness of the suburban supermarket where the checker and box boy manage to combine a dale carnegie obsequiousness with contempt and the customers barely mask their irritation at the slightest inconvenience i cannot know the pain and tensions that lie beneath the dignity and warmth of my harlem neighbors but i find the behavior of these underclass black people in the supermarket vastly pleasanter and more civilized than that of their white superiors in the suburbs nowwhat have these white educators who know nothing of my supermarket in harlem to give the underclass black boy depending on their competence they can give him knowledge and skills regardless of their competence they will probably try to give him their middleclass value system many negro boys will undoubtedly accept all this and darkercolored gingerbread boys will begin rolling out of the high schools indistinguishable from the lighter ones but the best of the underclass black boys may resist they will retreat into the proud hostility with which my boys fought the schools pattern of middleclass conformity they will be termed incorrigible unmotivated and ungrateful they would like the knowledge and skills but not at the price of their own integrity their parents will watch with loving concern as i did cherishing their sons strength fearful that the boys alienation mav drive them to consider them  selvesand to be considered cutaws it is wildly funny even to think of expecting the educators to move bto the ghetto so that they could measure some of their statistics and stereotypes against reality their superiority and condescension ae so deep that it is inconceivable to them that they could learn from the underclass but mavbe we can reach a truce with them let them stop talking about the culturallydeprived child because the term may mean anything or nothing to them it means a black child in the ghetto to me it means a white child in the suburbs lets agree that underclass children need to be taught reading mathematics science fine arts and social studies devoid of middleclass propaganda they do recognize that we are the underclass separate from their middleclass let the schools confine themselves to knowledge and leave out the compulsory value system although the educators apparently worship money and success let them quit patronizing us because we are poor and undistinguished if their middleclass culture looks good to us well try to adopt it quickly enough if not thats our business possibly the high school assembly line could then convert from gingerbread boys to human beings
at the recent writers conference at fisk university ossie davis had some striking things to say about the importance of images said mr davis images must correspond to some accepted reality upon which people communicate and are agreed probing further he asked do you know that because of the connotation the word black has in our culture when you look at your child and call him black you have already insulted him in sixty different ways certainly one of those ways is implied when one looks in an anthology even the most recent ones to find such a neglect of negro writers that it is appalling there seems to be one reason for this neglect the image of the negro as a serious writer is extremely difficult if not downright minacious certainly three centuries has produced writers whose works are worthy of recognition the neglect is calculated the negros image as a writer suffers of course a solitary few make the grade yet in no area is pure tokenism so evident another way in which the negro is insulted is that too often before he opens his mouth even in the presence ofperhaps especially in the presence ofthe white who knows him only across the discussion table he is labeled if his language is the cultured speech of his training it is passed off as imitative if it is characterized by the dialect of an uneducated environment though no less different in the main from the speech of immigrants it is regarded as repulsive quaintness is the reason for other linguistic aberrations in america explanation for poor speech among negroes is connected with physical type no one would attempt to explain the phraseology throw mama from the train a kiss in terms of size of mouth shape of nose or mental type yet many writers of the early twentieth century sought to do this with negroes according to dr raven mcdavid and his wife jerome dowd j a tillinghast and even early howard odum have deliberately publicized arguments for the allegedly childlike mentality of the nesro as reasons for dialectal variations or imagine the temerity of albert wiggam who claimed in his popular column lets explore your mind that the negro cannot pronounce words such as car  beard and bird because his lips are too thick thick lips and blackness have long been a part of this combination of insults which every negro has felt regardless of the varying hues of his skin as recently as spring  explaining a fundsponsored project in updating negro speech the newscaster referred to the average speech of the negro as repulsive and unintelligible this somewhat blanket statement is hardly fair in isolation for it could easily be said of any group or any situation where there are expected departures from common language patternsfamily relationships daily chores work play cookery and even intimacies language has three basic forms if one is to try to assess its variations scientifically lexical phonetic and morphological lexically the negro has participated fully in adding to and perpetuating the word stock of his country this participation and contribution goes far back into the history in america proof of this is to be found all the way from his earthy southern speech to the louisiana patois to the gullah of south carolina and georgia to the bahamian traces in key west and miamito the classic epithets i remember from a dear lady nearly  years old who though nearly illiterate in the specific sense was verbose in the use of such alliterative phrases as sitting there like a nut on a tusset said in sibilant disgust phonetically and morphologically perhaps because of the negros isolation from american cultural life for so long the negros speech variations are most apparent and to some obnoxious close examination will show that dialect forms are in many instances similar to th century english english teachers of the race no doubt overzealously have demanded strict adherence to the rule often forgetting the students and even their own erstwhile background certain pronunciations do seem troublesome picture vs pitcher diploma postponed mischievous to mention only a few yet listening in on rural radio or television stations one realizes that mispronunciations are not racially inspired nonconformity to morphological forms is apparent in numerous verbs principal parts of drink become begin do etc conjugation of the verb to be in the present and past tenses for example yet one immediately recalls that lil abner is not based on negro cultural life education is gradually wiping out grammatical variations and it seems to me that the time has come for the triplelinguistic revolution of  appreciating the contributions lexically and literally that negroes have made to american culture  allowing the negro a chance to see himself in perspective as he moves into a new era and  allowing the negro at this historical juncture to begin to look back with natural pride not shame upon the folkways and folk language of his own group 
the great societys t war on poverty has one feature that cannot be overemphasized among the youth of the underprivileged and that is the various programs intended to introduce culturally deprived youth to books and libraries the project head start for preschoolers with its story hours and availability of many wellwritten and excellently illustrated childrens books and the wellstocked libraries for the young people in the job corps are not luxuries by any means but rather they are important ingredients for successful programs the mixture of the right books and poverty historically have stimulated some very interesting creative results among men excellent examples would be the cases of james baldwin ralph ellison and richard wright all three having several facts about their lives in common first they are americans from similar economic and cultural backgrounds second they are negroes and third somewhere in their writings they have revealed that books andor librarians have played important roles in their lives as creative writers it was as a youngster that baldwin discovered the librarya harlem branch of the new york public library he attended the childrens story hours in the afternoons and on saturday mornings where he listened to the stories told by the childrens librarian as a teenager he was a ferocious reader he read and reread uncle toms cabin and the tale of two cities and held as his favorite authors henry james ernest hemingway john steinbeck nathaniel hawthorne and many others he discovered in his community and school libraries by the time baldwin was  he was a preacher at the storefront fireside pentecostal church in harlem the school librarian and some of his teachers remember him as a small bright sadlooking boy he was editor of the high school literary magazine and spent much of his free time reading and writing instead of playing stick ball on the streets of harlem after three hysteriatinged years as a preacher he discovered that he would rather be a writer than a boy preacher his big break came in  when he was awarded a eugene saxton fellowship which permitted him to devote full time to his literary work following his first professional publication which was a book review in the nation magazine it was not long before articles and stories appeared in partisan review american mercury commentary reporter and harpers magazines like many of the earlier american writers who as young artists found themselves disenchanted with home and became exiled baldwin moved to paris in  it was while in paris that he was able to develop in a more congenial atmosphere he stated that he wanted to go to paris so that he would not become merely a negro writer but after a few years he found that paris was not completely the haven he had expected at least he was able to publish his first book a novel with a significant enough title go tell it on the mountain following this first published work came several other works of fiction and essays there is no doubt that james baldwin is a significant contributor to american letters librarians like to think about baldwins introduction to the harlem branch of the new york public library as the beginning of his becoming a writer an author dedicates his book to an individual or individuals who have been an inspiration to him or contributed in some great way to the writing of his book in ralph ellisons latest book shadow and act published in  his dedication reads for morteza sprague a dedicated dreamer in a land most strange it is significant to note that the dreamer the late morteza sprague was librarian at tuskegee institute for  years or more sprague still remembers vividly the first time he encountered ralph ellison as a freshman taking an introductory literature course as a youngster ellison discovered t s eliots wasteland and because of his interest in poetry he attempted to follow up all the footnotes reading all those books perhaps it was in the library at tuskegee that he discovered the negro poet countee cullen and his powerful poem heritage a poem that was to make a profound change in ellisons attitude towards the negro who knows maybe it was cullens poem that helped him to answer the question what am i some years later with the following remark i answer that i am a negro american that means far more than something racial it does not mean race it means something cultural that i am a man who shares a dual heritage books librarians and poverty i am sure proved to be interesting chemistry in the life of the creative genius ralph ellison in the case of richard wright peasant life on a mississippi plantation was never forgotten as a youngster wright lived in natchez jackson greenwood and carters  in mississippi elaine helena and west helena in arkansas and memphis tenn as we can see his childhood consisted of moving from one southern town to the next or parttime jobs and sporadic schooling at  he ran away from home and took a job in memphis it was there that he had his first public library experience in his essay the ethics of jim crow published in  he describes how he devised a way to borrow books from the public library   it was almost impossible to get a book to read it was assumed that after a negro had imbibed what scanty schooling the state furnished he had no further need for books i was always borrowing books from white men on the job one day i mustered enough courage to ask one of the men to let me get books from the library in his name surprisingly he consented    armed with a library card i obtained books in the following manner i would write a note addressed to the librarian and sign the name of the white supervisor i would stand at the desk hat in hand looking as unbookish as possible when i received the books i would take them home if the books listed in the note happened to be out i would sneak into the lobby and forge a new one in this manner wright developed even deeper his passion for reading cutting his teeth on such authors as theodore dreiser h l mencken sinclair lewis and sherwood anderson his first published pieces were poems articles and stories the federal writers project hired him and published one of his stories in the anthology american stuff his first book uncle toms children was followed by native son twelve million black voices black boy the outsider and several other works of lesser stature james baldwin ralph ellison and the late richard wright did not have the head start classes of today where hundreds of children are being introduced to not only books but painting music and all of the other wonderful things children need in todays world to make their lives more meaningful and complete we know that it was only through chance that these men discovered books but let us not leave to chance for future baldwins ellisons and wrights because we know now that books and poverty do mix
in all the tumult and shouting over established racial discrimination in the various areas of community life in chicago the national spotlight has declined to linger on one of the most positive and concrete accomplishments to emerge from the freedom movements struggle it is just as well operation breadbasket proceeds most effectively in the quiet semianonymity of the phone call and the conference and it has been effective in early september after less than six months of pressure and negotiation operation breadbasket had secured for chicago negroes some  jobs representing a staggering total in annual income of approximately  operation breadbasket in chicago is organized along the same lines as its successful predecessors in other cities notably philadelphia ministers of both races and of many religious faiths and denominations band together to seek jobs for negroes in those industries which do considerable business in the negro community but which nevertheless hire few if any negroes a committee of these ministers approach the management of these businesses suggest that they add a previously determined number of negro employees and offer their services in steering qualified personnel toward the industry in the beginning many of the businesses balked when that happened the ministers returned to their pulpits advised their parishioners to boycott the products of the reluctant businesses and waited it was never necessary to wait long when the money stopped pouring into the coffers the business management saw the light negroes were hired operation breadbasket shrewdly concentrated first on dairies for the produce butter milk of dairies is perishable boycotts quickly show results there soft drink manufacturers are particularly vulnerable in the summer and campaigns were mounted to bring them into the hiring line dozens of truckdriving jobs paying  to  a year were made available to chicago negroes for the first time that the industries capitulated with such ease is in itself an indication of the widespread and longstanding inequity which characterizes the hiring policies of the firms even in those cases where the businesses employed some negroes a pattern of excluding negroes from toplevel jobs was clear operation breadbasket also demanded that negroes be upgraded in some of the boycotted firms chicagos operation breadbasket is an arm of the coordinating council of community organizationssouthern christian leadership council campaign against slums and their evils all the ministers of the community are invited to participate and most of those with some social consciousness and some sense of involvement in the freedom movement have done so a few notably influential ministers have refrained from lending their support to the program operation breadbasket is fortunate in chicago to have the services of a young minister and divinity student named jesse jackson not yet  the rev mr jackson is blessed with the kind of balance and maturity which usually comes with age he is cool under fire determined and articulate but he also knows human psychology and something of the limitations of his movements power not the least important his wit and humor does not allow him to take himself too seriously
not too many years ago after world war ii a azz pianist named thelonius monkal­ rnii ready a mature black artistwas struggling to be heard he had a new kind of music that some people couldnt quite understa it and others laughed at and called bebop we all know what has happened since this time and few people today are not familiar with monk and his music monk is now an accepted legitimate black artist what we dont know though is the hell that this man had to go through to be heard and appreciated and the fact that every black artist has these same terrifying barriers to go throughbarriers that take up a lot of unnecessary time for the black artist that has not made it the problem is how to reach a public that is controlled by people who to say the least are not with him i contend that every jazz lover if he could only see what black choreographers are doing in the field of modern dance would also be a dance fan but in this field the black artist finds himself in a  strange position he knows the worth of his works he knows that the black public would appreciate and understand what he is saying as an artist yet he finds great difficulty in reaching not only the black public but any public at all lets face it the powersthatbe are not interested in seeing negroes in any way but as rhythmic freaks about whom they say they certainly do have a good sense of rhythm well i am not an animal and i wont tap dance or play the part of the maid i am a human being and have the same feelings that any other human being would have i dont want to entertain them if i am thrown in a ghetto and condemned to an outcast life of hating i am not going to create a ballet about swans it would be completely divorced from reality and a little bit insane if i did i can only create from the life around me i am sure that you realize as a black man or negro in american today it isnt pretty so when and if you do come to see my dances please dont expect to see pretty things the man that is the destroyer because he has had the seed of hate planted in him is what im talking aboutthe junkie my vision of harlem is that it is a modern equivalent of the slave auction bloc and the black mans work and worth is still being sold in a very subtle but direct way the auction block is the central motif of my work blues for the jungle premiered at an october  concert at kaufmann auditorium in new york city the dancers who historically mount the block trace the development of the black man in america we see the railroad worker who built the west the jubilant new freedman the sanctified gospel people the blues singing entertainer the tap dancer and the junkie all of these people are the modern equivalent of slaves here in rich america today and because of this they end the work in a riot scene that shows they simply want to destroy what has destroyed them as human beings baby this is not swan lake this is america circa  and any black artist worth the sweat on his back from creating has to deal with this reality which is exactly what is here now if you can see what i am creating now i certainly would appreciate it id hate to have to wait until the power structurepromoters and impresarios and you know who they arethink that you are ready in another  or  years in any case it is you that im talking to and its you that im talking about the blues i sing is our blues baby

nat hentoff has a healthy list of literary credits and they grow more impressive each year his call the keeper viking  is a brief but poignant display of his allround writing ability call the keeper is a fast reading novel perhaps even a novella which makes a swift excursion into black nationalism black nationalism is probably as old as black men but there are new inferences and ingredients as the black man continues his current search for himself in white america there are sequences in this book and messages which required some courage for hentoff to commit to paper this compensates for some of the false ring of the dialogue one of the most powerful characters sounds more like an english lord than an intellectual cop if you can imagine one hentoff makes some fairly sound statements about the basic philosophies and rationale of black nationalism as it now stands further he seems to have something of an idea of what its all about which is more than most negroes for example can honestly claim despite the fact that the book is about black nationalism one of the most attractive characters is randal a white musician i am not certain that hentoff intended this to be so but when randal is compared against other characters he seems to be the hippest of the lot randal simply is he plays randal white jazz musician he has the respect of the black chauvinist who leads the group randal plays in because he doesnt try to be black he plays out of what he knows    this is perhaps the best message of the book a man simply has to play what he knows otherwise you sound like the sons of mothers who had colored maidsbrooks johnson ri the world of jakov lind is a place of unending horror there is no corner in it where the reader may settle down amongst familiar and normal signs and souls and be for a while at peace his collection of short stories soul of wood was such a place peopled by creatures out of a nightmare so real that it was impossible to dispel them and his new novel landscape in concrete grove  is also such a place the central character of this picaresquefantasy is a german soldier named bachmann the time is the last months of world war ii when the wehrmacht is suffering defeats on the eastern front and there is an atmosphere of disarray and desperation bachmann is lost from his unit somewhere on the eastern frontwhile in retreat his unit was mired in mud and the novel begins with bachmann alone in a forest far from the front but he is not alone for long he comes upon a strange weasellike creature a soldier like himself who lives in a burrow in the ground the soldiers team up sharing a forest hut and a goose dinner but they are natural enemies the antipathy of each other the one burly and not very bright the other razorthin and as cunning as a cat the one stolid and disciplined the other sensitive and devious and bachmann the heavy plodding embodiment of all the germanic virtues outwitted and deceived ends by executing his antagonist but it is not his only murder in norway where bachmanns erratic search for his comrades leads him he calmly shoots down three members of a wealthy family on orders from a sinister civilian bent on exploiting his uncanny power over the german bachmann finds his way back to germany to the town where the girl he would marry is waiting passing her time evading the amorous attentions of her benefactress and bestowing her favors on imported laborers from nonnordic lands this girla mountain of a femalehas been ever in his dreams but when she is finally in his arms he sleeps but bachmann is mad he has been adjudged so and his flight across germany has been undertaken in an effort to regain his status as a sane man and as a true son of the fatherland for he is a patriot and it is impossible to imagine not serving his country in the end however having acceptedno insisted uponhis madness he is told that he is indeed quite sane and that he is absentwithoutleave from his unit he is sane then the world is mad these are the bare outlines of landscape in concrete conveying nothing of the special quality of terror and cynicism and symbolism with which the novel abounds for despite the figures of ridicule and satire evil overblown what emerges is merely a picture of a universe beyond the pale and that is imaginable that is believable indeed in reading landscape in concrete one can begin to comprehend the horror which flowered in germany and threatened to overshadow the world and one can begin to see how approval of murder in mississippi can set the stage for american buchenwalds the budding flower landscape in concrete is a grotesquely compelling novel it also is a warning
thomas e eliots classic statement on the metaphysical poets in an essay by that title in  is too well known to warrant explication here yet besides contributing to or more accurately spearheading the impetus for the revival of the metaphysicals as objects of study the essay stands as a classic example of the power and influence wielded conjointly by the critic and ralph ellison the university eliots essay gave rise to a new group of critics who less judicious than either dr samuel johnson or matthew arnold have dictated the tastes and forms of english literature mainly in america for over a decade and those new critics in most instances were connected with the university either in teaching positions or through prestige and influence the trend in recent years toward a different type of orientation in most cases going back to the biographicalhistorical method of taine and saint beuve only serves to point up the importance of both the critic and the university in determining not only literary standards but to a great degree the works which in the judgment of the combine criticsenglish professors meet these standards the result has been of course a dictatorship which makes the dictators of oldpope dryden dr johnsonseem like new deal democrats those who have been damaged most severely under the iron rule of this combine are negro writers never taken seriously in the american society never conceived of as much more than a protester the negro writer today despite james baldwin and ralph ellison fares little better among the men of the ivory tower than his predecessor saunders redding has adequately summed up the argument against the anthology writers who refuse to anthologize selections of negro authors yet the nucleus of the problem lies in the classroom itself and here the negro members of the combine are as guilty as the white members recently a young graduate of a distinguished negro college in the south who had majored in english literature and had taken several courses in american literature asked me after thumbing through one of the books on my shelf who is this man i never heard of him before this man was james weldon johnson and the book was his autobiography of an excolored man to document the ignorance of the white collegian would be needless for few white students to whom i have talked have knowledge of any negro writer outside of the big three wright baldwin and ellison however the example of a professor may serve as a case in point the professor holding a doctorate in english literature and at one time chairman of the department of a university renown for its english department on reading a paper of mine with saunders redding as the subject implored me to find out if the works of saunders redding could be found in the university library i think he remarked that every student should read the works of this man thank you for bringing him to my attention this was in  and saunders reddings first book appeared in  but more than ignorance of the works of negro writers is involved here much more pernicious are the concerted efforts by critics and professors to dispute the charges brought against the american society by the negro writer without having to engage in a dialectic the concept of the liberal professor willing to acquiesce in change and to examine the new and different is a concept nonapplicable to the professors of english departments for the most part english professors are the most zealous conservative upholders of the status quo more inclined to quote dr johnson to champion that which is right because it is established than that which is established because it is right a case in point is professor robert bones book the negro novel in america which for some years now has served as a source book for any study dealing with negro literature professor bone pretends to examine his subject with the scrutiny of the objective literary historian yet throughout the book bone drops his mask to record his personal reaction to any statement or any work as a whole that dares to point accurately to the reality of the american society let us hope it will not be taken as evidence of    american chauvinism if we point out that there are in fact important differences between the negros status in philadelphia and in georgia between the systematic genocide of the hitler government and the supreme court decision of  he writes in explicating william gardner smiths last of the conquerors if we concede that professor bone is not being chauvinistic we must then assume thatfor want of a better wordhe is being naive if we substitute new york for philadelphia not the philadelphia of  when smiths book was published but today when according to bone great progress has been made and accept the basic contention of bones argument that the negro is better off in new york than in georgia then we would be hard put to explain why the most vocal voices of protest against the american society are the voices of two new yorkers james baldwin and leroi jones but the second half of the statement is not only naive but ludicrous in that bone attempts a feat of logical legerdemain which would not deceive even a first year philosophy major the analogy between the systematic genocide of the hitler government and the supreme court decision of  is no analogy at all better would be the analogy between the genocide of the hitler government and the lynching of over  negroes a recorded number which does not include justifiable homicide a favorite phrase of northern police courts or deaths from unknown causes such as bodies found in the mississippi river during the search for the bodies of chaney goodman and schwerner but this is an analogy which professor bone cannot bring himself to make and those negro writers who make such analogies receive the most devastating attacks in bones anthology nothing better illustrates this fact than the almost hysterical critique of the works of james baldwin in less than  pages bone asserts that baldwin is everything from a sexual maniac to a psychopath indeed sex becomes the organizing principle around which bone bases his criticism of baldwin but clear to the reader is the fact that bone has undertaken a defense of the sexual and racial mores of the american society james baldwin in particular and the negro protest writer in general is then his dragon and he bone is the societys st george for an example of how baldwin can be criticized sanely and from an unbiased point of view see saunders reddings since richard wright and the problem of the negro writer but bone at least has the courage of his convictions unlike other instructors and critics bone brings his contentions out into the open and he discusses ofttimes skillfully the deficiencies of many negro novels yet the majority of the instructors of english literature those in positions of responsibility make no such effort in many universities both negro and white one may receive a doctorate without having read one line by a negro author in a western university whose english department ranks among the best in the country the only negro author included in the syllabus is ralph ellison in fact the selection of ellison evidences the fact that tokenismnot confined only to the industrial and social sphere of the american society some time ago when an english department wished to display its propensity for taking all literature as its province richard wrights native son was ushered forth to prove that the university had its one negro representative for some reason the wright stock has nosedived but a successor in the form of james baldwin was quickly ushered in to retain the universitys image but alas the baldwin stock proved to be even less solvent than the wright stock baldwin lasted only about three years and to fill the gap ralph ellison was quickly brought forth the reasons for ellisons ascension to university eminence range from the oftquoted but true statement that invisible man is a supreme accomplishment in its own right to the assertion an assertion which both irving howe and ralph ellison have given credence to that invisible man is not a protest novel invisible man remarked a college professor deals with modern man in the universe not an isolated negro in an oppressive society nearer the truth is the fact that ellisons novel no less that the novels of james baldwin is a protest novel the only difference and an essential one is that ellison has clothed his novel in myth and symbolism so skillfully that the average critic is unable or unwilling to search for the protest beyond the symbols and myth another user of symbols and myths william blake has not been as fortunate in this respect as ellison scholars have looked for the meaning behind the blakean symbols and have discovered that poor old blake was an avid protestor after all this has not however caused his literary demise but instead has added to his prestige the ability to deal with ellison then by skirting the indictment of the american society means that ellison will be read in universities for a long time to come yet the majority of negro writers and i mean the good ones though being good has been no criterion for the selection of white authors for college syllabi will remain unread in colleges both negro and white for the american society is not yet capable of looking at the negro through glasses cleansed of  years of prejudice and the combine which controls the selection of the material which could do most to erase this distorted impression exercises its vast power in a negative manner
lee came into v  the cafe to drink some ® if beer he had worked hard today it had  rained too much to do any plowingcouldnt put a tractor out in that delta land when it was wet the rich loose top soil was so deep that a tractor would sink down in it so his boss man had made him dig ditches all day ditches that led nowhere the man had only required the work of him in order to keep him busy and ossie lee had had to dig the ditches there wasnt much else he could do he lived on the mans place in his house owed him money but ossie lee set aside his thoughts he wouldnt worry about all that now just sit here and rest a while spend the dollar he had in his pocket for some beer and wait on his friends from the other plantations to come around miss lula bring me a quart of falstaff and some skins miss lula came over to the table she was a big woman not yet old maybe  she called everybody baby how you doing baby look like you been working hard got that mud all over your clothes in your hair a

exchange well you sure dont look a day over  maybe cause you still got a good body strong not all broke down like a lot of the men around here and i always did like the way you held yourself you know like couldnt nobody walk over you miss lula was smiling she was pleased to be able to speak so well of him maybe hed feel a little better now ossie lee appreciated her effort and replied in kind well miss lula i always liked the way you carried yourself too it took some doing to keep the cafe open without even a man to help you you a pretty good old lady even if you are getting fat from your own cooking she feinted a slap at his head for this little insult and then resumed her businesslike air i got to see what jimmie lee and them want over at the bar ill bring you your falstaff soons i take care of them i got some good neckbones cooked in the back you want to try some no miss lula i ate at mamas already just bring me the beer ossie lee put his foot up on the next chair and looked around to see who was there it had taken him a while to get used to the darkness the only light came from the schlitz beer signs with the luxuriously dressed brown girls and from the music box which commanded one end of the small cafe nobody was there that he knew well hed just wait nothing else to do no reason to go home there were two girls sitting over in the corner of the cafe he had not seen them before looked like they might be sisters the smaller girl was very pretty she was black and so thin that you felt you could see everything that was happening within her the movement of every muscle the angle of every bone he liked the way she looked he figured that they were from up on mr mills place he had heard that mills had brought in a new family up there miss lula returned to his table here baby heres your falstaff she noticed ossie lees feet in her chair her lips tightened now why you want to mess up my chairs putting your feet on them come on and do right always wanting me to keep this place but youall wont help me to keep it up you  years old had a house of your own you know how to treat other peoples things ossie lee was offended but he took his feet down he couldnt afford to get her mad with him miss lula had a shotgun back there that she would put to anybody seeing that she had put ossie lee in his place she resumed her friendly manner she said i guess you pretty lonesome now since your wife left you i never did know what happened what did happen nothing much she was mess ing around james edwardyou know him he live down on mr hendersons placeand i wasnt going to have that everytime i told her about it she tried to get smart with me so id just have to whip her she musta got tired of that one day she went down the road to the store and just kept walking didnt even take her clothes yeah well where is she now she sent three bus tickets for the children the tickets were to memphis i guess thats where she is now miss lula stood quietly at the table for a moment then she directed his attention across the room you see those two girls over there in the corner they just come over to this county come from up in tallahatchie county a week ago some nice girls too named minnie pearl and johnnie mae the thin little black one with the yellow dress on minnie pearl she loves to dance why dont you put a quarter in the music box shell dance for you ossie lee looked at the  cents he had left from his dollar he weighed the value of spending it now on the little black girl against the possibility that later he might get somebody to match it and buy another quart of beer he didnt know anything about the girl but she did look nice she was a pretty girl he hadnt been getting much satisfaction from drinking beer or from doing anything else lately seemed like no matter what he did he couldnt get satisfied the disappointments of his life weighed heavily on him in fact ossie lee had for the sake of his sanity accepted his life situation he had yielded to it long ago at the age of eight the acceptance of his life style had been irrevocably forced upon him the night they came to take him that night they called ossie lees father to the door they were two jesse come here want to talk to you bout that smartacting boy of yours his father turned to his mother get them in the back sarah mae she hurried the children ranging in age from  years to three months into the back of the tworoom house his father went to the front door forced a smile to his face how yall this evening we fine jesse only thing wrong with us is that boy of yours ossie lee he let one of my chickens get run over this morning send him out here got to teach him a lesson he got to learn to take care of property else he aint never going to be a good hand ossie lee saw his fathers shoulders drop well sir mr perry i knew he been running too much aint got good sense yet but he still young i give him a good whipping tonight he do better no jesse i think i ought to take care of this myself he going to be working for me   years he got to learn how to take care of my things realizing that he was in trouble ossie lee slipped over to where his mother had gathered the smallest children perry ignoring ossie lees father walked straight through the house and into the back he had a long cotton sack on his arm sarah mae give me the boy ossie lees arms went around his mothers waist she folded him into her skirt pressed him to her she pleaded with the boss man please sir dont take him off he just a baby just made eight years we take care he dont do nothing like that no more spare him this one time he just a baby perry did not bother to respond ossie lee looked up at his mother and over to his father for help neither his father nor his mother could look back into his face he began to cry no mama dont let him take me mama daddy mama in support of him the other children set to crying perry seemed not to hear or to see any of them he leaned over to ossie lee pulled him from his mother and despite the boys kicking and struggling forced him into the cotton sack as perry moved toward the door no one offered resistance ossie lee cried hard he knew that they must have heard him were they going to let this man take him away why didnt they run after him and pull the sack from his hands mama daddy you always took care of me where are you perry carried the boy out in the  sack and handed him to the other man who had been waiting in the truck he cranked up the truck and drove away no one came even to the porch to see in what direction their boy had been taken as the truck moved away ossie lee came to understand that his people could neither refuse to let him be taken nor even demand the knowledge of where he would be taken understanding this he himself ceased to struggle against so obviously powerful a force his kicking subsided his crying ceased his muscles relaxed he merely waited to see what they would do to him after riding about  minutes the truck stopped ossie lee was pulled from the truck and emptied from the sack onto the ground they had come to the muddy river where ossie lee had fished only a few days earlier the white men stood over him perry said boy you been mighty careless lately letting that chicken get run over dont seem like you want to be a good hand do it ossie lees immediate reaction was to defend himself to assert that he had been watching the chickens as best he could but that there had just been too many of them that he couldnt have kept up with all those chickens but then he checked himself he admitted that nothing he said would matter to these powerful men that it was their show and not his accordingly he replied thats right sir look like i aint able to be no good hand perry went on you got to learn to take care of property thats whats wrong with you colored people now you dont know how to take care of nothing im going to give you this whipping so youll watch after them chickens from now on get your britches down for the last time ossie lees self revolted no not my clothes you cant make me take off my clothes daddy dont even do that no perry stood over him you not going to do what i tell you well ill take them off for you and ignoring the last willful act that ossie lee was to perform in his lifetime the white man tore off his britches and began to whip him with a corded rope perry whipped him until he got tired and then the other man whipped him they kept it up for about  minutes it hurt badly and ossie lee cried but he didnt really care anymore when they finished they shouted some words at him and left him lying by the river at which he used to play ossie lee waited until they left and gathered strength to clothe himself and return home in another half hour he made it home his parents were waiting for him in the same positions they had held when earlier they had allowed him to be carried off his father stood by the door alone his mother sat in the back room only the smallest children looked into his face as he opened the door and entered the dimly lit house at his arrival the family went back to its normal activities his mother gave the baby to carrie the sevenyearold and set about cooking some bread for supper the older children went out to get water and wood for the next morning the little children began to harass one another ossie lee said nothing he went over to his space on the bed which he shared with three brothers and lay down and buried his face in the quilt his only effort was not to think not to assess the situation which an hour ago had been thrust upon him soon after he had laid down his mother called him to supper she handed him two tin plates with biscuits and molasses here take your daddy his supper too ossie lee walked to the front and gave his father his supper he sat down on the floor next to his father and began to eat his father leaned over took the boys head in his hand and gently shook him you alright boy yessir im alright thats just the way things is you know yessir i know the remainder of ossie lees life followed the order established that night he did carefully what he was told never more never less along with the other children he tended the animals and chopped and picked the cotton and when each year after the cotton had been laid by it came to be revival time he too went to the mourners bench and got religion when he was big enough he was told to start driving a tractor this he did and continued to do for the rest of his life he learned to drink whiskey and to go with women at some point he married and brought forth three children to share the life which had devastated him through it all there was something in him which refused the final admission that he was dirt under white folks feet and that he deserved the dehumanization that they meted out to him yet he could not reject it he felt too old to leave home and start over again and since his father had died and his older brothers had left for chicago he had to stay on the place and do the mans work so that his mother and the children would have a house to live in and something to eat thus being able neither to accept nor to reject his life ossie lee had constantly to buffer himself against it but lately things had been going badly more closely each week dissatisfaction had approached his consciousness and he no longer had the means to push it back he still found comfort in the church and release in fighting and drinking  with his friends but not like before now it was hard work to get happy ossie lee had grown weary in the defense of himself after he had finished his beer miss lula came back over to his table she encouraged him further about the girl sitting across the room go on and put your little quarter in the music box aint going to do you no good sitting there ossie lee looked across at the girl once more he did like the way she looked under miss lulas prodding ossie lee walked across the small room to the glowing big bellied music box and deposited his quarter he turned his head toward the girls yall want to come choose some records come get the music you want and dance for me the girls conferred with one another for a minute and then came over to where he stood they looked to be about  years old ossie lee studied the little black one she looked clean had a pretty face as he watched her she looked from the music box to him assessing her new arena of activity her sister asked him his name where he lived and all that she said nothing only kept time to the music until her sister would be ready to dance when the music burst from the music box the two girls joined hands and danced together they danced lithely gracefully to ossie lee the little black girl so thin in her loosely fitting yellow dress looked especially graceful his senses followed her and were refreshed he followed her so closely that for the while that she danced for him he was able to push away the disturbing consciousness of his life as she danced he relaxed and leaned back on the music box to watch her when the music ended the girls went back to their seats laughing and talking breathless from their dancing later someone fed more coins to the music box this time it sent forth blues music slow pounding insightful music about loving and living ossie walked quickly over to the girl in order to reach her before anyone else when he brought her to him to dance it was as he had expected her body fitted itself to him fitted itself and then relaxed into him as they moved slowly with the music he pulled her still closer drinking in the ease with which she lived and moved they danced for an inmeasurable time when finally they sat to rest neither spoke he remained beside her for several minutes and finding no words stood up and walked over to where some friends were lounging against the far wall they received him without comment he too leaned against the wall propping himself with his booted foot he inquired of them that little girl got a man round here one of the men answered no dont think so she aint been here but a few weeks and aint none of us hit on her yet we just been watching her miss lula watches her pretty close miss lula really likes that girl aint let us get next to her say we dont mean her no good she likes for us all to dance and have fun but she dont want you to take that girl nowhere ossie lee grunted something in acknowledgement and walked away from them he kept walking through the door and on to his mothers house his life thereafter was centered around evenings at the cafe his days assumed a strange proportion the mornings went quickly he easily did his plowing ran his boss mans errands and carried the other hands home from the field to eat dinner he was eager to make the day go by so that evening would come but then after dinner when the evening was indeed near time seemed to stand still every task took forever the cotton rows seemed to be miles longer than they had been in the morning it seemed that evening would never come when finally the work day ended ossie lee would go home and so that he could savor every aspect of being with her he would force himself to change his clothes in a leisurely manner and to walk slowly up the road to the cafe when one evening he directed her from the dance floor to the door of the cafe she followed him outside he motioned to her to get into his  ford as he cranked up the car he turned to her were going to get your things i want to marry you you can stay with me and mama this week and next saturday well marry ill get you a house soon as i can the girl turned to face him what about your wife shes gone she knew what she was doing when she left do you want to marry or dont you she said yes she would marry ossie lee drove to her mothers threeroom house some of the children were sitting on the sagging porch trying to fight off the mosquitoes and to get some cool air she went in spoke a few words to her mother and her sisters and gathered her things to go with him her mother came to the porch to see them off as the girl climbed back into the car her mother called to her you know you can always come back home at ossie lees home the girl was well received his mother was glad to have another woman around to help in the field and to see after the children the children liked her at once she played with them yet took them seriously and she danced with them even with the baby who couldnt walk in the evenings ossie lee took her to the cafe when he told miss lula that they were to marry she shook her head she sat down at the table with them and took the girls hand in hers she said baby i dont know how to say this but i dont think you should marry its too much in you for you to go off with some man now i wish you wouldnt do it im a old lady i  seen a lot a pretty black girls but you got something special dont throw it away i know you got to live and you got to help your mama well it aint enough work here for two but ill give you a job here in my cafe if youll just stay on with your mama the girl understood she answered simply i think the best thing is for me to go with ossie lee the older woman turned to him you a good man alright ossie but you dont mean this girl no good you ought to let her stay home let her stay out where she can dance ossie lee chose to take her words lightly he laughed you better get away from here talking like that me and minnie pearl going to marry on sunday and everybody is invited to the wedding down at pilgrims rest miss lula turned back to the girl remember baby if anything happen you got a friend here the girl smiled thanks miss lula ill remember andill be alright they married on sunday later in the week ossie lee saw his boss man about getting a house for them to live in the man told him where he could have one but he said it might have to be cleaned up some then ossie lee and his wife went to look at the house it was an old wooden tworoom house with a tin roof because of its age the whole building leaned to one side it was filled to the ceiling with hay ossie lee was slapped again by the circumstances of his life he sat down on the broken steps and leaned his back against the wooden roof support that bastard expects folks to live in a place that he wont use for nothing better than hay i dont know sometimes i just dont know his girl stood on the porch between him and the door of the house she said to him thats alright well fix it up come on lets go up to the cafe for a while no i dont want to go to the cafe i dont want to go nowhere he walked away from the shack his head down and his arms dangling loosely she followed him to his mothers house ossie lee came into the house stepping over children and around beds and ducking electrical wires he laid across the bed she laid down next to him and tried to make him feel better youll see it will be nice well get the hay out put in some windows buy some curtains from the ten cent store he just lay there when he tired of the noises of the house he sat up on the bed come on lets get out of here as they walked slowly up to the cafe she tried to take his hand but he shook his loose he didnt want her hand she couldnt help nothing could help nothing could remove the fact of that hayfilled shack to which he would take his wife they entered the cafe and took seats at a table in the middle of the room she looked around the room for her sister recognizing her in the back she went over to talk with her soon someone put a dime in the music box and the two girls began to dance ossie lee watched his girl she danced with the same ease and enjoyment that she always had but he could not come out to her he could no longer lose himself in her dancing he was held too tightly to the hayfilled shack too closely to all the meaningless ditches he had dug as he sat immobile in the chair he grew angry how could she dance like that when she had just seen that place what kind of a fool was she to think that there was anything to be happy about any place on earth to relax as he watched her his anger grew still more and his muscles stiffened he pulled himself up and went outside to get some air he sat down on the steps rested his head on the wall and looked out into the darkness a big hand descended on his shoulder it was his cousin willie c willie c was a tall thin brownskinned man with most of his teeth missing he and ossie had grown up together he leaned his dirty sweating face to within inches of ossie lees hey ossie lee i aint seen you out by yourself in a long time not since you got that little black girl from up on mr mills place i got some old corn whiskey out in the car jake and fats they out there now drinking it all up come on drink some with us before its all gone he pulled at ossie lees shoulder ossie lee said alright man lets go they went around back of the cafe to where the other two men were standing ossie lee helped them to finish off the pint of whiskey which they passed around he drank quickly thanked them and left he went back around into the cafe and took the seat he had had earlier in the evening his girl was at the table laughing and talking with her sister about finding her a husband they tried to include him in the talk but he only grunted when the music started the girls once more got up to dance she asked him you want to dance when he did not answer she went off with her sister again he watched her move and his anger swelled he could not permit her to dance like that not today not in the face of that hayfilled shack ossie lee held himself in his seat for as long as he could by looking the other way by talking to people at the next table but he could not ignore the pounding of the music he could not negate the sound of her laughter as she danced he rose from his chair walked over to his beautiful black girl and slapped her to the floor she got back to her feet but was too stunned to hit back at him again he hit her now in her stomach she doubled over in pain the other people who had been dancing moved back from the couple only the girls sister pushed her way over to her screaming at ossie lee to stop hitting her sister she enclosed her sister in her arms and stared back at ossie lee who was readying to fight her too as he approached them he was stopped by the sound of a gunshot the crowd moved aside for miss lula she placed the barrel of the gun into his side her face was tightly drawn her eyes shining her arms holding steadily to the gun ossie lee dont you touch that girl again in my place if you got something to settle take her home but as long as she is anywhere near where i am you cant hurt her now get out of here he turned to the girl you coming with me she nodded yes the two walked away from the cafe back to his mothers house at home they silently prepared for bed the thin black girl slipped into bed beside her husband he took her in his arms for hours he caressed her aroused her loved her he worked with her until he felt sure that he had given her a baby a baby which would weigh her down and destroy her balance so that she would dance no more
the breeze moved in from the lake and £ across the campus e brisk and with the faint sharp smell of winter only a short time away don watched a leaf break away from a limb and start toward the ground he switched his books to his left hand and let the sounds of people greeting each other as they moved across campus break into his thoughts he realized again how natural it had all seemed and how he took such things for granted in high school so many centuries ago it must be at least that long but he knew it had been only a short time longer than a month when he had first reported for early freshman football practice it had been lonely as only a college campus can be without studentsdeserted empty stagnant it was as different from the same place as a football with no air discarded and forgotten during the summer months hed known it would be different when the students began returning for registration and it had been he found for the first time that the difference between loneliness in a place without people and loneliness in a crowd is a difference in intensity it was a comparison of pain such as the difference between a shin splintthat dull annoying ache along the shin bone that comes from running too much on hard ground that could be forgotten completely in the gameand the sharp biting pain from a pulled muscle that slowed you down and held you back no matter how tightly taped loneliness was pain and like all pain you could learn to live with it but he could never quite forget its first bite when the crowd of returning students first gathered in the union snack shack he stood in the surging laughing crowd and he had never felt so lost as in the shouts of greeting and the inquiries of how the summers had been spent he hadnt even had the compensation of being one of the many other freshmen who could share misery of being new alone and so on the outside of things because he had been on the campus early and had registered two weeks before and when the newcomers had been drawn to others like themselves recognized from the endless registration lines to enviously watch the easy closeness of the upperclassmen over a coke he was shagging punts on the practice field  he entered the snack shack in the union basement and waited in line for a coke he walked into the lounge and scanned the crowd for a familiar face and walked toward terry bates who had been his roommate in the athletic barracks until hed been cut from the squad because he was too slow for a tformation fullback and too small for a lineman terry had pledged his older brothers fraternity and moved into the house and he hadnt seen much of him since he walked to the table spoke sat down and was introduced to terrys pledge brothers talk about the team and the coming season drifted into the party at the house that weekend and he was glad that he no longer had to contribute because ann bennett came in laughing in that fresh easy manner as always with that easy glide that had caught his eye the first day of practice anns father was a member of the faculty and she had been on the campus before the other students began to arrive her father had been an allconference quarterback some years back and ann was often with him she had led an orientation tour early the first week and was in his english and history classes and on this basis he developed a speaking acquaintance that had advanced to the smalltalk stage and hed called a few times and had been refused a date and the more he saw of her the more he wanted to see of her his glass was empty and so was the talk at the table so he got up and walked toward anns table in high school he had always laughed at the way fellows would describe the trouble they had talking to a girl they happened to like but now he felt just as he did before the kickoff for a big game hi ann how are you hi she returned and her smile tied his stomach into knots hows english coming finished your theme for the week well just about ill probably finish it tonight and he wondered what to say next if she didnt ask him to sit down he could feel her friends staring at him and he wondered what they were thinking and he felt his palm moist on his books he found he was looking to see the color of her eyes they were a deep dark brownalmost black he suddenly knew she wouldnt ask him to sit down and he moved off stammering something about the english assignment who was that ann hes kinda cute gee i dont know i can never remember his name hes in my english class hes only a freshman though she pondered a moment she should know his name it wasnt important however anyone want another coke im going over to the counter don watched as his ankles were being taped and felt himself beginning to withdraw it would keep up like this until everything around him would be hazy and far off and he would be almost sleepy he always wondered about the pregame tension being described as butterflies in the stomach because his stomach only felt tight as if he had tensed his muscles and they had frozen stiff it would be like this until he was hit or threw a block or caught a pass and then everything would be all right he pulled on his shoulder pads and tried to think about ann bennett but he couldnt because todays game kept crowding in this was the final scrimmage before the season opened and the freshmen and varsity squads had been combined and divided into equal teams the last squad cut depended on todays performance ann was a question mark but football was no mystery all he wanted was his signal and the ball in his hands he sat on the bench watching the game and waiting to be called he knew there was a question of his being cut in spite of his record in high school because he came from upstate and the conference was made up of smalltown schools and he could easily be another upstate flash who failed to stand up under the tougher competition his high school coach had told him not to worry that everything would be all right once he got into a game he was the type athlete who no one noticed in practice who could never seem to have the drive and the speed and the fire that had every eye on him in a game from the first time he carried the ball his eyes were halfclosed slits now and he almost seemed not to breathe he wanted his hands on the ball and he wanted the sharp clean thrill of body contact the tension built slowly inside him and he could release it only when he was out on the field doing the thing he loved more than anything else he knew he was in the huddle at last and the mixed smell of sharp sweat and green grass quickened his pulse he heard his play called and he licked his lips and almost smiled he moved forward hard and seemed to hear the signal after he started toward the line though he knew it had started his motion the quarterback was almost too slow moving around for the handoff because he had never started as fast in the signal drills theyd run he got the ball and saw the hole open just before he reached the line steve johnson was moving in with that deceptively swift motion that had made him an allamerican line backer don faked to the left saw him hesitate and drove hard to the right he felt an arm slap his leg but he was free and he knew he would go all the way and he could almost taste the feeling he would have when he was in the clear and the goal was coming closer he watched the defensive halfback and safety as he drifted towards the sidelines       don looked across the lake and wondered how long it would be before it froze and thought of the picture of the people ice skating on its glazed surface that had looked so inviting in the catalogue the reg istrar had sent him he thought of the girl in his last class who had never spoken to him before and how she smiled so warmly and congratulated him on the game yesterday and of the people he didnt know who had been speaking on the campus all day it was real easy to make it from an outsider to a guy everyone spoke to and smiled atall you had to do was score three touchdowns in a football game it wasnt for him he was the same person nobody had known or cared about the day before and those characters could go jump in the lake before it froze over this was the place the catalogue talked about with the songs and lifelong friendships   it had said nothing about bringing along a football to get acquainted with people he suddenly felt so homesick for the crowd at home in the drugstore after practice that he wanted to throw his books across the campus his desk lamp threw weird shadows on the walls and the french book lay open at the same page he had started on an hour before he thought of the girl who had never spoken before and how she told him which dorm she lived in three times in her conversation and how they were having an open house sunday and why didnt he stop over if he had time because shed love to show him the place and maybe they could study together sometime because he seemed to know so much about the subject and she was just lost and how did it feel to score three touchdowns in one game and she bet he would make allamerican his first season just like the papers said he thought of all the people who suddenly knew his name and smiled and waved on the campus and of terrys brother who had urged him to come to the rush next week because he felt he was the type man his fraternity sought it was real easythree touchdowns he heard his buzz from the bell on the wall and walked to the phone in the hall it was ann and he felt his palms begin to sweat why hadnt he called lately and how did he like the campus and how was english coming along and congratulations on his wonderful performance and then it was hard remembering the rest it was something about a party that weekend and would he like to be her date and he was hating himself more than her for saying yes three touchdowns he walked back to the room and the bitterness was a knot in his throat and he thought of calling her and breaking the date he thought of this idea and smiled at her imagined reaction he sat down at the desk and read awhile he stopped and stood up walked to the door and fingered through his ties the blue gray and red would go well with his new charcoal suit he would have to look sharp this weekend
for those with hearty appetites for violence it is no longer necessary to stay awake half the night watching late late shows on television nowadays one only has to tune in a newscast to see the sights and hear the sounds of violence in american society there is sufficient variety to satisfy every taste or proclivity and for those who prefer a less vicarious violence than the news of the day offers more direct exposure and excitement are readily available for example one might want to spend the january or spring collegiate holidays at some beach where students congregate to riot or later in the season go to newport for all the jazzgovernor wallace of alabama who is no novice about violence has recommended a ride on a philadelphia subway since should you not witness an assault or have the fortune to be attacked there is at least the chance of being bitten by a police dog according to the new york daily news which also betrays an affection for violence those who would prefer their action aboveground should take a stroll in central park at night italianamericans can seek membership in the mafia while white gentile protestants as usual have the most options since they are eligible for the american nazi party the minutemen the ku klux klan and the john birch society with the right connections in certain localities careers in violence are apparently still possible in the teamsters union those who would be victims rather than aggressors need only burn their draft cards the young and hardy can enlist in the marines and with any sort of luck end up in vietnam as perhaps a final resort one can become a cop and seek assignment to occupation duty in one of the black ghettos of the urban north all this of course is only a way of saying that violence is manifold and commonplace in american society it seems always to have been so in the colonial protests for fair taxation and political independence and in the revolution itself in the indian wars and the conquest of the frontier in the war between the states and the trauma of the reconstruction crisis in the emergence of the labor union movement and in the era of prohibitionto mention but a handful of historical examplesas well as in the present day whether violence is more widespread today than in earlier times i seriously doubt but how could any accurate measurement possibly be made whether there is a pattern of violence peculiar to our time which did not previously exist i equally doubtprobably no one really knows whether the violence modern society suffers is more vehement than in other periods is impossible to assess what is most significantly different today is that communications are virtually instantaneous the whole country watched ruby shoot oswald the impact of the incidents and images of violence is immediate upon the consciousness if not always upon the consciences of citizens everyone saw the troopers savagely charge then lash and gas and stomp the selma marchers on black sunday in march of  all knew immediately when and how and who murdered jonathan daniels the watts riot kept millions watching their tv sets what is different now is that the facts of violence cannot be ignored or rationalized or suppressed or even distorted too much because there are so many onlookers to every violence that makes it difficult to accountin a rational wayfor the popularity especially among the white middle classes in both north and south of the falsehood which equates civil_rights demonstrations with violence in the streets one recalls however that this mistaken notion has had faint echoes from ordinarily responsible quarters notably in statements of former president truman ridiculing civil_rights demonstrations such as the selma march and in some of the general lamentations for former president eisenhower about the disruption of law and order before that however the alleged equation of civil_rights protests and violence gained notorious currency in the  presidential campaign indeed this propaganda became so abrasive and blatantly exploitive that senator goldwater himself was moved to repudiate some of his campaign material as racist that repudiation has not of course prevented others most notably the john birchers from persevering in the same savage lie the truth however is that violence initiated by negro and other citizens in the civil_rights movement has been rare and minimalso farespecially so if the scope duration and depth of the protests are taken into account the overwhelming number of acts of violence in the american racial crisis has been instigated and executed by white people their murders tortures mutilations and bombings of negroes have almost always been perpetrated with impunity if not actually accomplished either directly or collusively by the police authorities themselves from  through the end of  there have been sixtyone homicides directly related to civil_rights as to which there has yet to be a single conviction for murder or manslaughter it is not possible to ascertain how many other homicides have been committed which have never even been reported on a police blotter no plaintive rationalizations can erase that dismal record no amount of whitewash can conceal that much blood
the violence that has erupted in which negroes have taken the initiativeso farhas been in the riots and skirmishes in the ghettos of northern cities it is hard to determine what degree of violence is necessary to have classification as a riot but by my own calculation there have been seventeen ghetto riots in  and whatever the computation these incidents have not beenso far associated with any civil_rights demonstrations as such there remains an urgent need for an objective inquiry into the causes of the riots they cannot fairly be blamed upon negro civil_rights leaders in fact negro civil_rights leaders have done much more than any others both to curtail the riots and to work on the scene inside the ghettos after the riots have been quelled bayard rustin dissuaded some in the harlem riots from exploding a cache of dynamite that was capable of obliterating an entire city block dick gregory was wounded while pleading for a halt to the rioting in watts the southern christian leadership conference has established a beachhead in chicagos black belt and the northern student movement has been working for months in several eastern cities to forestall or ameliorate riotprone tensions the negro civil_rights leaders who have been committed for so long to the ethics and tactics of nonviolence recognize of course that the riots immediately pose a threat to their philosophy and strategy of social change they also realize what apparently most white people cannot comprehendthat nonviolence can prevail in the negro revolution only if it yields significant results perhaps malcolm_x the assassinated leader of the black muslims knew this truth better than anyone he was much misunderstood and editorially maligned as an advocate of violence this is not true he doubted that passive resistance would bring substantive progress foreseeing that it might evoke a greater recalcitrance toward change among the whites in the face of that prospect he did not advocate aggressive violence by negroes against white society but he did uphold the conviction that when a man is assaulted he has the dignity and right to defend himselfone of the most vulnerable principles of anglosaxon common law i am an episcopalian not a quaker although i trust a peaceful man i am not an ideological pacifist i do not assume that all violence is the same or that every incident of violence is to be uncritically deplored or that one may never revolt or that a christian may never be found in violence most likely the american democracy could not have been constituted in the first place without the revolution and nowhere in the world has it been easy to overthrow colonialism without violence the conscience of bonhoeffer involved him in a conspiracy to assassinate the head of state in his countryadolf hitlerand both in his life and in his death jesus christ was not a stranger to violence at least this should suggest that there are different sorts of violence no attempt is made here at any exhaustive or definitive analysis of the ethics of violence but the history of american social protest teaches us that an important distinction exists between intentional deliberate tactical violence on one hand and unpremediated spontaneous sporadic violence on the other for example in the early part of the labor revolution especially in the s both those in protest and those defending the status quo engaged in willful violence as a means of pursuing their respective social aims for both sides violence became integral to strategy and was thought to be the necessary and effective way of achieving certain objectives the northern ghetto riots of the  rep  resent a very different kindofjviolence they havenot beertpremeditated acts but have incarnated a violence of despair they represent a spontaneous violence nobody planned or plotted these riots no one conspired beforehand no one calculated that such violence would gain anything for anybody they were not the work as the fbi itself has repeatedly confessedof professional agitators disgruntled beatniks adolescent hoodlums black supremists or communiststhough once the fires of revolt were ignited it would have been astonishing indeed if some attempts were not made to feed the flames it is also significant that up to now the violence of the ghetto riots has been internalized what happened took place inside the ghettos and did not represent a direct assault upon white society or white property or white people in this sense the riots have been a symbolic violence the day when the despair of ghettoized negro citizens turns into wrath will be the day that someone tries to blow up city hall or burn down a white department store or sabotage an urban rapid transit system that will be the day when the violence of despair is no longer internalized and confined inside the ghettos but becomes open insurrection against white society almost all the riotsso farhave been occasioned by comparatively trivial and superficially unrelated provocations the two exceptions are in chicago and new york in chicago in the summer of  a negro woman was fatally injured by a fire truck being operated in a grossly negligent manner there was no driver for the rearladder apparatus in new york in the summer of  a negro boy was shot and killed in the presence of scores of other school children by an offduty white policeman in circumstances which to say the very least were extremely ambiguous in both these cases there had been serious incidents human beings had been either mortally injured or killed in the other cases howeverin trenton new jersey springfield massachusetts in watts in los angelesthe occasions for riot were relatively inconsequential and in some cases actually innocuous in rochester new york for example a man and his wife evidently drunk were arguing with each other on the sidewalk and were properly arrested for disorderly conduct by the police in philadelphia there was an ordinary traffic violation and the arresting officer was a negro such common and apparently insignificant incidents were enough nevertheless to kindle into riot the accumulated and inherited passions frustrations hostilities grievances hurts and pains of an imprisoned people in other words these northern city riots are a most radical form of violence perhaps the most volatile there can be unpremeditated unpredictable without tactical goals undisciplined chaotic without focus or definite purpose a spontaneous combusion of fury that is the mood which now threatens to overwhelm the civil_rights movement despair is probably the most pathetic human response of all because it operates on the assumption that there is no honest hope of meaningful change how can we ask the negro to believe that their everyday lives are about to be transformed and that their fragile dreams will not again be shattered despair in the ghettos can no longer be appeased by promises and pronouncements about gradual improvements despair expresses the defeat of human expectations for society now that it has been unleashed it will not be easily or quickly distracted not even by war much less deterred or displaced
the despair which spawns the violence of the american ghettos is nourished as much by the apathy of white society as by the abominable conditions of ghetto existence the despair of urban negro citizens is as profound as the apathy of white citizens is obstinate no more appropriate symbols of the apathy of the american white establishment exist than in the incumbent political administrations of the principal northern cities warned of impending trouble in watts in the spring of  mayor yorty of los angeles refused assistance from federal trouble shooters which had been offered by representatives of the war on poverty mayor daley shortly before the first chicago riot in  publicly boasted that there were no ghettos in chicago in boston a militant racist mrs louise hicks has fashioned a promising political career by her skillful manipulation of the apathy and latent racism of white parents thereby entrenching her personal power in the school committee and evidencing her availability for the mayoralty office equally typical was the response of mayor wagner of new york to the harlem riots of the summer of  after that trouble had been ruthlessly suppressed by the police the mayor called a press conference at which he stated that the unrest in harlem had some connections with the conditions in which the people there lived from day to day he mentioned the decrepit ratinfested tenements the obsolete academically inferior schools the shortage of jobs the absence of equal opportunity he even suggested that something should be done at the end of his administration a year and a half later however nothing had been done categorically and literally nothing in this respect new york is not unique among the great cities of the nation but it represents the epitome of white apathy if the promises of white people are regarded by negro citizens as not only empty but perhaps calculated deceptions and if the white mayors and other public representatives are thought to be somewhat shrewd if not very subtle cynics more than any other single thing it is the complacency of white society and the city halls they still dominate which is responsible for the secret premise the hidden assumption the unstated commitment the unconscious sentiment of most earnest wellintentioned lawabiding churchgoing peaceloving moderate white citizens is that the circumstances of life within the black ghettos should be improved somehow but that the ghettoization of society will indefinitely remain most white citizens are as yet not pathological in their attitudes toward negroes they are not vulgar and vicious racists but they have been reared in an ethos of white supremacy for so long that ghettoization is assumed as normative they have the idea that the racial unrest in society is due to an insufficient degree of white paternalism not yet realizing that parternalism is itself a form of racism what most whites who are not militant racists envision when they hear the words integration or civil_rights is a time when a significant empirical betterment of places like harlem and woodlawn and watts will have been achieved they entertain images of black ghettos becoming decent and pleasant habitations what white moderates do not realize is that they themselves are ghettoized not only racially but physically in the places where they live and study and work and play and worship and also in their minds and mentalitiesand hence in their morality white moderates are still enamored with the possibility of a society in which there is equality but separation not understanding that equality is inherently incompatible with the radical division of society by race in the basic spheres of life and that it represents an inequality suffered on both sides of the racial barrier whites who fondly assume that negroes prefer to live with their own kind must face the fact that it will only be when negro citizens have free access to reside and work and study and vote and live wherever they please that such a proposition can be seriously tested what incites despair inside the black slums is manifestly the failure to remedy glaring inequities in housing education and employment part of the secret of such despair is found in the profound psychological emotional and moral insularity of white people who complacently assume that such places as harlemeven if somewhat improvedwill continue to be ghettos indeed the atrocities of white racists in the deep south are probably easier to bear than the recalcitrance and ingenuity of white paternalism in the urban north this accounts in part for the strong reaction within the negro community to the celebrated moynihan report which had been advanced as the basis for deliberations at the  white house conference on civil_rights and was properly controverted by dr benjamin f payton now executive director commission on religion and race national council of churches the moynihan report prepared by daniel p moynihan while he was assistant secretary of labor  argues that the legal barriers to the assimilation of negro citizens have been substantially removed but that the critical obstacle that remains to integration is the breakdown of the negro family structure ajid tjie emasculation of the american negro male such a position is not exactly untrue but it is terribly incomplete and misleading unless placed alongside other important factors the moynihan report uncritically assumes that the inherited white family institution and the patterns of assimilation appreciable to white immigrants are the criteria of social stability which should and can overcome the disintegration of negro family life without acknowledging inherent strengths in the negro family though moynihan himself is obviously no racist and is a strong advocate of an immediate policy of total employment his report inadvertently furnishes a subtle rationale for the continuance of white paternalism it represents a halftruth because it fails to take note of the decadence of the american white family as it may casually relate to the plight of the american negro family or as an appropriate standard for a socially mature family structure as such of course if a moynihantype report were writtenas it well could beon the parallel breakdown in the white family structure in america and its accompanying defeminization of the white female it is unlikely that the white house would convene a national conference but in any case the racial ghettoization of society will only be more cruelly entrenched by any efforts to make negro families into facsimile white families what is needed to absolve despair is the determination that there be an end to ghettos every ghetto blights every city and town in this land with a negro population must be erased only by beginning with that commitmentand there are few signs that white citizens are even contemplating such a commitmentis there a serious possibility of conceiving and executing public policies which can at once free the prisoners of the black ghettos and emancipate white americans from the ghetto of their own complacency the ghettos must go both white and black must be freed from their imprisonments but what does that imply in terms of concrete public policies while i have no panaceas the most significant change would be a conversion in the mentalities of both white and negro citizens as for a black ghetto like harlem it is now so congested so deteriorated and so insufferable as to be mostly beyond rehabilitationa place unfit for human habitation but to destroy the harlem ghetto rather than futilely to patch it up would mean that the existing population of harlem would have to be dispersed and relocated elsewhere in the city and more than likely in the suburbs in localities where from the outset of the dispersion there would have to be integrated housing education and employment opportunities legitimate questions could be asked of course about whether society has the right to uproot people from where they now live and relocate them somewhere else but it seems that this is the practical reality wherever citizens are consigned to places like harlem no doubt white neighborhoods and schools and businesses in communities where dispersed negroes would find many patterns of society threatened or changed in such a process but the answer to that is that the bourgeois white ghettos must also be erased if this is to be integratedor simply a human society perhaps dispersion is not an appropriate remedy but it is an imaginable step and one that could be undertaken in fact it is the sort of policy that might well be considered if the moral commitment of this society became one of abolishing the ghettos instead of merely at best preserving and improving them the important thing is that integration means the disruption and rejection of much that has been taken for granted for many generations in americaa drastic reappraisal of values which has not yet been even theoretically contemplated
while i mean to furnish no comfort whatever to the pathological racist among white americansto those of the ku klux klan or the john birch society or others whose reason has been pervertedlet it be nevertheless confessed that there is no serious ethical distinction between such racism and the more benign and more secretive white supremacy so common among the great multitudes of moderate middleclass whites no doubt there are aesthetic differences a mayor daley or a mayor yorty is not as vulgar a person as a bull connor or a governor wallace on the other hand a wallace seems far more candid than a yorty of course there is an aesthetic difference between those who have bombed negro churches in the black belt or those who have shot at civil_rights workers and those whose dividend income is gained in fact if not intentionally from speculation in slum real estate or investment in enterprises which practice de facto discrimination in hiring advertising customer services and the like but the differenceat least in new testament termsis one of aesthetics not ethics the massive indifference of the ordinary white citizen of good intentions is the moral equivalent of the perfidy of the white racists the profound apathy of the white moderates is ethically tantamount to the radical impudence of the white racists that the difference between the pathological racists and the socalled moderates in either north or south is a matter of aesthetic distinction rather than ethical significance can be documented in all too many ways in the colleges and universities of the north for all their venerable liberal traditions there is almost universally only token integration this has now been achieved even in most southern colleges and universities with a few exceptionsdartmouth is onethere is no significant evidence of any inclination to move beyond tokenism in higher education in either section of the country or to address the issue which realistically remains the chief barrier to admission of qualified negroes to college the cost of tuition and room and board despite all the dropouts among negro secondaryschool students there remain thousands of negro students qualified for college who do not goor even applybecause the costs of higher education are prohibitive other factors affect the collegiate admission of negro students too many with college potential are diverted early in their public education into vocational and commercial courses many are reluctant to attend overwhelmingly white schools and become exhibition negroes conventional recruitment and admissions procedures are often designed in a way which disadvantages the negro applicant because built into those interviewing and testing practices is the unarticulated assumption that the applicant will be a white middleclass type much as a female applicant for law school is at a disadvantage because admissions formalities are still geared to male applicantsyet in the face of the most urgent need for increased access to higher educational training for negroes one repeatedly encounters the pathetically unrealistic rationalization of professing white liberals that negro students already qualified for college entrance should be spared special preference in admissions lest they suffer reverse discrimination when in fact the effective barrier to their admission is simply lack of money there is also the gruesomely hypocritical matter of church investments where mission boards denominational institutions local congregations and parishes synodical and other regional authoritiesnot to mention legions of individual churchgoershave the audacity to utter praises to the name of christ whileagain with a bare sprinkling of exceptions profiting financially from a racism as evidenced by their endowment investments and by their current contracting hiring and spending policies as to that there is no important difference between the actual social witness on the side of racial segregation and discrimination among the churches and their related agencies in any part of the country or again the moral kinship between the moderate and the professed racist can be seen by comparing the political regimes which both support and the similarity in tactics with respect to the racial crisis practiced by those administrators both in the northern cities and in the southern hinterlands just consider those tactics as they have unfolded in the racial strife in both parts of the country separation in both north and south regimes depend upon the separation of society between the ghetto and the rest of the society in order both to nurture a mentality of acquiescence and a capacity to endure hardship among the ghetto residents on one hand and to supply the ignorance and prejudicial stereotypes of other citizens about the ghetto people on the other concealment in both there must be substantial concealment of the suffering and deprivation of negro citizens by keeping the actual conditions of ghetto existence out of the convenient sight of white citizens a necessity often met by the routing of traffic under over around but never through the blighted section toleration demonstrations for equal rights while undesirable must often be tolerated within the ghetto where sometimes they tend to relieve tension but seldom impress the people outside marches however outside the ghettos must if possible be stamped out suppression if violence does occur it must at all costs be localized within the ghetto and be suppressed by overwhelming force in the name of course of preserving law order and domestic tranquility rationalization when trouble does occur the authorities must be quick to locate a scapegoat in harlem hoodlums or drug addicts are always handy in alabama blame the communists and outside agitators they must be sure in applying this principle to repeat the scapegoat charges after the trouble subsides in order to impress the people outside and just as important in order to provide them with an excuse for any future violence proscrastination appease everybody by promising anything usually the ghetto people will be quiet for a while if a delegation is received at the executive mansion allowed to refer to grievances which in such a reception will be understated generalized and vague and solicited with a few indefinite assurances that whatever should be done will be done sometimes inviting the delegation to pose for news photographs ameliorates tension and abets evasion in case of emergency however keep promising to get to the bottom of things and to cure any legitimate ills or evils if pressed further though it is unlikely appoint a committee if truly desperate try to keep ones head and name a commission because it sounds more important and impartial of prominent citizens to investigate an investigation has an automatic virtually magical effect since people still suppose that investigation is a synonym for decisive action distraction the maneuver is to be employed especially by mayors or governors in times of crisis attention can be preempted for example by staging a parade for astronauts or by denouncing air pollution or engaging in harmless controversy with a politician in the other party tactics such as theseall too common in both north and south cater to white apathy and thereby show contempt for the selfinterest of those who are white and prosperous as much as for the rights of those who are black and poor 
perhaps only a psychiatrist could fathom the meaning of white apathy in the racial crisis to me however the most significant single factor in the present situation as ghetto violence embodies the profound despair of negro people is that the apathy of the great majority of white citizens may itself be a parallel form of despair realism enlightened selfinterest human reasonall argue convincingly for the constructive involvement of white citizens in working the social changes required to banish poverty abolish the ghettos and rehabilitate the nation economically socially and politically as one society but apathy prevails the reason cannot be any lack of public information or absence of warning about the crisis it has been almost literally impossible during the past decade to read a newspaper or watch a newscast without gaining some awareness of the scope and ominous potentialities of the racial struggle no white citizen including those who still live in communities where there are no negro residents can plead ignorance to excuse noninvolvement perhaps white citizens have received some sort of mass inoculation perhaps in fact they have become so conscious of what is decadent in this society so sensitive to the magnitude of the racial crisis so aware of how many assumptions of white society are threatened so astute about the upheaval in their own existence that would be wrought by significant integration of american public life that they have become paralyzed so they read the news of demonstrations and see photographs of riots and hear the cries of the poor but can no longer understand any of these things allowing themselves to become victims of the repeated lies of the racists or despairing of finding anything they can do which would not risk their property their status or their very lives if they do not themselves become racists they remain mute pretend that the problem is somewhere else fasten onto ingenious rationalizations remind themselves that they are personally innocent of any offense toward black men or revert to the banalities of brotherhood observances no one escapes this debilitating fatigue in some form or other i know that i am sick and tired of the racial crisis god knows how negroes must feel but i as a white man am now almost overwhelmed with the feeling that i do not want to hear anything more about it or see anything more of it or do anything more in it i wish it could somehow be escaped or evaded or avoided there was another great crisis that this nation endured within my own recollection and about which i felt somewhat the same during the korean war i was in the military service though mercifully i was not stationed in korea or called into combat but nevertheless i vividly rememberas many others also mustan acute fatigue in which i did not want to hear or see or do anything more about that awful war i wanted it to somehow evaporate and make no more demands on me i am pretty sure that this sentiment which was fairly prevalent did not alleviate or abbreviate that war in any way on the contrary if anything it must have contributed to its aggravation and prolongation something similar is true now in the american racial crisis  wish it would end without my being any longer or any more deeply involved i would rather escape from what now happens to this nation yet i am certain both in my mind and in my guts that this exhaustion will not hasten the resolutionmuch less reconciliationof the racial crisis it can only frustrate and compound iteveryone in the united states is now involved in the racial crisis if there ever was an option on this subject it has expired the only issue that remains is how one is involved obstinately stupidly irrationally or with concern intelligence and compassion on that matter let us at last face some simple truths  the racial crisis is not a good cause in the sense of some conventional charity like cancer research or aid for victims of disaster let whites renounce the romanticism of good works and the preposterous condescension of socalled liberalism no white man is doing a favor for any negro citizen by now advocating the ordinary rights of citizenship for the american negro in  if such involvement constitutes favor it is as much for the selfinterest of whites as for any negro citizen  the negro revolution must be considered within the context of the ethics and traditions of american social revolution there is no great novelty to social revolution in america and if the present crisis is seen as part of this history an astonishing fact emerges all earlier revolts were characterized by the ethics and tactics of violence until the negro revolution with the possible exception of the woman suffrage movement the women were apparently nonviolent in their demonstrations in the streets considering the vast numbers of citizens involved in the present revolution and the depth of their provocation it is incredible thatso farthe negro revolution has been for so long dominated by the ethics and tactics of nonviolence  the dimensions of the negro revolution are such that the very survival of the nation is at issue the life and livelihood of every citizen is at stake however damaging it may be morally and psychologically the united states can probably survive even while continuing to exclude the american indian from the mainstream of its political and economic life politically and economically the exile from american society of the indian is hardly noticed but the denial to twentytwo million negro citizens of decent housing educational opportunity gainful employment political responsibility and free access to public accommodations is bound to threaten the survival of the nation for everybody the exclusion of that many citizens from society jeopardizes the political freedom economic solvency psychological stability and moral integrity of those who are not excluded just as much as those who are white people must finally wake up to the fact that their own welfare is quite as much at issue as that of the negro at least let profound selfinterest in the nations survival finally end the paternalism of white men for black men in these united states  civil disobedience is not uncommon among americans there are probably very few citizens who have not in one way or another indulged in acts of civil disobedienceespecially in realms of the law concerning taxes traffic liquor sales and consumption gambling and sex the laws of some jurisdictions invite disobedience by evasionas in the case of new york states divorce laws all citizens need to remember as we observe daytoday developments in the racial crisis how widespread civil disobedience really is of course there are different forms of civil disobedience until the riots the civil disobedience characteristic of the negro revolution for the most part has been such that those who have disobeyed state and local lawsagainst which they were protestinghave willingly borne the consequences of their disobedience they have submitted to arrest endured prosecution served jail sentences and paid fines even in their disobedience they have upheld the rule of law the other form of civil disobedience opposes and denounces the rule of law as such and is not only a disobedience to existing law but an attempt to overthrow the rule of law by taking the law into ones own hands this is the civil disobedience of the lynch mob the assassin the birmingham bomber this is the civil disobedience that so far has been maily practiced in the racial crisis by whitesespecially in the south but not only thereand to which all too often the police authorities themselves have been privy  the negro revolution is the eye of the hurricane but it is not the whole storm it is the most intense focus of contemporary social crisis but that crisis involves many other citizens all those who are poor all those who are sick and uncared for all those who are old and unwanted all those who are young and neglected all those whose skill and labor are made obsolete by automationall those in other words who have either been cast off or outcast in americaall those for whom the promises of freedom and humanity and society remain unredeemed in america in the twentieth century that the crisis is acutely dramatized in the situation of the negro citizen does not mean that if there were no negroes in america or if the negroes continued to acquiesce in their own humiliation and oppres sion this nation would escape the reformation that history now forces upon it the truth is rather that american negroes have become the authentic pioneers of a reconstruction of american society sorely even pathetically needed by all americans and of which we will all be beneficiaries should it come to pass
but will it come to pass that is ominously doubtful it is now about twelve years since the negro revolution broke into the headlines and has evidenced organization and direction there have been all these years of peaceful protest sitins and freedom rides and picketing and prayer vigils and marches in that time thousands of citizens have been arrested thousands have lost their jobs thousands have suffered shame and humiliation in the churches in schools in the courts in hotels and parks and other public places even in their own homes in the pursuit of their rights as citizens the question which now plagues the civil_rights movement is whether the ethics and tactics of nonviolence have been vindicated in results it is a very american a very pragmatic question which now overtakes the negro revolution what does the american negro citizen have to show for these long years of unparalleled dignity and humanity and restraint in the south they have to show the decomposed remains of those sixtyone human beings some negroes some whites who sought to help citizens there to register to vote or who joined in peaceful demonstrations and protests and who were murdered for it and whose murderers have gone free hundreds of citizens can show you the scars on their bodies where they have been branded by cattle prods or bruised by police clubs or bitten by dogs in one sixmonth period in one southern jurisdiction alone more than forty churches and homes were bombed and burned and like the homicides this terrorism remains unpunished if that furnishes a macabre consolation to any northern citizens it need notnot any moreafter one counts the homicides committed by the police during the northern ghetto riots and the multiple indignities which ghetto citizens endure in the north every day in both parts of the country it is true there is now token integration in some schools and in most colleges and universities but tokenism is all it is almost anywhere meanwhile the churches remain steadfastly segregated with but rare exceptions and the unions have been far slower to desegregate than many businesses the congressional legislation of  and the civil_rights act and the voting rights billhave been the two most tangible results of the pressures of peaceful protest the former was at least responsive to the march on washington the latter to the selmamontgomery march yet the impact of both of these measures as necessary as each was and as significant as both are has been chiefly localized in the south there even before the public accommodations section in many cities white businessmen had acknowledged the breakdown of segregation as an economic institution and had voluntarily opened their shops and restaurants and hotels to negroes though comparatively few southern negroes can afford to patronize them regularly in the northern jurisdictions local legislation had long since pretty much covered the scope of the new federal laws and the patterns of de facto segregation had long since been established thus the new federal acts have had little practical impact     when therefore the pragmatic question is askedhave the tactics of nonviolence yielded significant restiltsthe truthful answer must be much more so in the south than in the north but only at afl eoimous cost in death and human suffering and nonviolence has not produced generally changes in the practical daytoday lives and livelihoods of the ordinary negro citizens of the land while only that sort of change can possibly vindicate the nonviolent leadership in the civil_rights movement thus the negro revolution has been plunged into a profound tactical crisis marches and sitins have never been as effective tactically in the north as they have been in the south and when other forms of peaceful protestlike the school boycotts advocating the bussing of students to achieve integration and quality educationhave been attempted in the north they have met with massive opposition from the incumbent political authorities and school boards as well as from white parents and teachers white intransigence has frustrated most forms of peaceful protest in the north and has in fact served to discredit nonviolence as a viable means of social protest meanwhile as the vietnam war has expanded and the demonstrations against that war have become more numerous and frequent many civil_rights advocates committed to nonviolence are bewildered as to what can be done tactically because they see that the antiwar movement has elicited such a wide public hostility to peaceful demonstrations about anything in this same period too the despair of ghetto residents has erupted in violence these pressures make it most difficult to maintain a nonviolence strategy in the tactics and ethics of the negro revolution the kind of social change which has impact upon the practical lives of the multitudes of negro citizens has not been launched by these years of peaceful protest nor is there much evidence it has even entered the minds of most white citizens thus the spirit of revenge is loose to prey upon the frustration and despair which american negroes have inherited from three centuries of slavery and segregation the mood becomes more militant and aggressive and explosive as each moment passes there is the passionate conviction that it is better not to live than to be a negro in the united statesnorth or southso what is to be lost by turning to violent assault upon white society and white property and white people
