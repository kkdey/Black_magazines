malcolm_x was three menmalcolm little malcolm_x and malik elshabazz as young ulqjy little he was by his own confession a harlem hustler and criminal converted by the black muslims when in prison he was malcolm_x one of elijahs fiercest disciples falling out with elijah muhammad and after visiting africa and mecca he became malik elshabazz a muslim not black muslim prophet as malcolm little he asserted his personality by attacking the white world and robbing it as malcolm_x he rejected whites completely and sought to be a savior of his people not just a  political savior but one of individual defeated negroes then in mecca he realised that mankind is one family from which no race not even white devilsis excluded having believed and said this he was shot dead in his prime it is this intellectual and moral evolution that makes malcolm heroic most of us if negroes would never have passed beyond the stage of criminal revolt some might have moved on to the second stage of personal puritanism political militancy and race hatred but few could go on to accept as malcolm did a dangerous paradox that negroes must fight every inch for their rights but not yield to the white crime of racialism malcolms negro detractors believe that in rejecting black racialism he rejected his people his white liberal enemies think that in becoming a muslim convert he was escaping from black muslim neuroses into the comfort of an exotic faith i think malcolm never denied his people for a second but saw that their cause could only be advanced within a context wider than that of u s negro politics with his contacts in africa malcolm founded an organisation for afroamerican unity believing that the black struggles in africa and america were one from these emerged a tentative black nationalist movement which rejected black and white dogmatism there is no reassurance for whites in malcolms life when he  was a harlem layabout they used him fixing kicks for whites was his specialty when he was a black muslim they feared and hated him when he turned to mecca they saw he was rejected by his people and despised him but for those with eyes to see he left a message for dark eyes it is threefoldthat only militancy will win that the worlds black struggle is indivisible that hatred is valid but not if it leaves the hater with only his hate for blue eyes the message is that blacks will never again be satisfied with concessions promises or gifts by conventional standards his life was a failure firstly because the whole fight of the american negro has hitherto been a failure next because the white americans have also failed disastrously to live with colored americansand since malcolm was very american he shares this failure last because in a mundane sense he never got anywhere but his example and influence are germinal for the prime american problemand perhaps world problemis the racial one the death of a hero has a rightness a perfection if a white had killed malcolm there would have been a riotthen oblivion but his own people killed him because they could not bear what he was demanding of them    and then the whites sighed in relief and the blacks knew this was a desecration they had killed themselves
martin_luther_king jr having conquered the montgomerys  birminghams and selmas of the south made a momentous m decisionchicago the challenge of this great northern ghetto was considered by most civil_rights leaders as insurmountable nevertheless king announced his determination to make an allout effort to shake the foundation of the slums and the powers that held negroes captive mayor richard daley shook and quivered in anger at this blatant intrusion into the affairs of his city he was not alone in making his decision king was obviously aware that chicago contained more than slums and housing discrimination it also contained one of the most controversial negro leaders in the nationdr joseph harrison jackson chicago was to become the battleground between two men whose individual philosophies and activities had already split the negro masses in general and the national baptist convention usa inc in particular with the arrival of dr_king dr jackson immediately took him to task as the push to eliminate the slums and institute a program for open housing began jackson utilized radio press and television to deplore the activities of the protest movement his attacks did not go unnoticed and he suddenly became the hero of backlashers and black conservatives the summer of  was long and hot a water sprinkler became the cause of riots and national guardsmen were called in to quiet the racial storm when king was accused of being an outsider disturbing the peace of the city jackson agreed while king was urging negroes to unite in soldier field jackson was urging them to stay at home as the religious leader of an estimated  negroes jacksons voice pricked the momentum that king had hoped to develop history was playing a repeat performance the kingjackson feud was in spirit a replay of the booker t washingtonwilliam e b du bois conflict this time the theater was chicago and the two new actors were ready to give sterling performances in the roles washington and du bois had originally created unknown to many the chicago competition between king and jackson can be considered the final act act i scene i took place  years ago in miami florida where the national baptist convention usa inc convened to select its new leader trying out for the part and winning the role was its current president who today holds that convention in a powerful ironclad grip joseph harrison jackson is a spellbinding orator friends and critics alike accord him to be one of americas great preachers he successfully utilized this talent to lift himself to one of the highest offices in the world of negro religionpresident of the national baptist convention usa inc winning the presidency after a stormy all night session in  it was considered at the time that his election gave promise of a new type of leadership he came to that helm when dynamic and constructive leadership was in demand we want jackson was the cry of the delegates    and they got him for the past  years they have had him in the early years of his presidency jacksons followers and admirers were legion some of the strongest negro ministers in the nation were among his followers and believers north south east and west men like j pious barber editor of the national baptist voice j raymond henderson california gardner taylor new york martin_luther_king sr atlanta marshall shepard philadelphia and dr benjamin mays president of morehouse college jacksons comer initially was crowded with intellectuals today none of these men are with him because one by one they deserted his camp the causes for desertion are many however two of the most important were jacksons reluctance to give up his office and his power plays to remain and his strange position on civil_rights during the years of the negro revolt act iichange scenes at the time of dr jacksons election a small wiry unknown youngster named martin_luther_king jr was developing his theology at crozier theological seminary in philadelphia pa unknown to him and to others at that time was the fact that his name would soon challenge the very structure of the conventional negro church and its leadership after the montgomery alabama bus boycott and the rise of martin_luther_king jr into international fame a new hard look was in order for negro leadership creative protest became the order of the times to negro activists jackson was not among this group although in the past jacksons voice had been one of many raised in eloquent protest against injustices perpetuated against negroes in the south no one could say it like joseph harrison jackson however the activist movement and the philosophy of king soon would divide the ministers into two camps the first issue that brought a schism was the issue of tenure the story of tenure in the national baptist convention usa inc was oddly enough closely allied with the fight for civil_rights from the organization of the convention in  and for a period of  years only  men had served as president of these  five had served one year one had served two years and one had served three years the remaining  years found four men in strong control of the negro baptists rev w j simmons  rev e c morris  rev l k williams  and dr d v jemison  during the late years of dr jemisons term a movement was begun to install young and progressive leadership joseph h jackson was elected one strong plank presented in his campaign limited his term to only four years this modern approach to leadership was accepted by thousands of ministers who had desired for years to free themselves from oneman domination a new article was placed in the constitution as insurance against betrayal the revised constitution read as follows article iv officers    election section  a president of this convention shall not be eligible for reelection after he has served four consecutive terms or until at least one year has elapsed in  the delegates were stunned when a jackson supporter stood on the floor to make a motion that this revision of the constitution be declared null and void when president jackson responded by selecting a committee to examine the constitution voices began to be raised among the voices was that of dr l k jackson the fiery minister from gary indiana he immediately condemned the administration as being immoral for tampering with the constitution dr martin_luther_king sr still a strong supporter of jackson demanded that l k jackson apologize to the convention for the strong language he had used l k jackson refused in denver september   the auditorium where the convention met was in a tempest the speakers platform was crowded with ministers from both sidesthose who wished to retain tenure and those who wished it to be declared null and void as the argument rose president jackson rapped for attention he was ignored with a rare display of emotion the president declared that the delegates could have the convention and made an angry exit the lights were turned off in darkness delegates began to stomp and yell for the president to return and restore order jackson would not reappear and the session was at a stalemate in september  the convention met in a dingy auditorium in louisville ky this was the session that supposedly would decide the issue the lines were clearly drawn the question of the hour would j h jackson be eligible for reelection or would another leader be chosen both contentions were set forth jacksonites insisted that the tenure provision was null and void because when the convention voted for it it did so illegally it was voted on the wrong day they claimed and that left the constitution as it originally was a president could succeed himself as many times as possible they pointed to the constitutional article that supported their stand
this was the legal clincher that the jackson forces held while conceding the fact that it was voted in violation of the constitution the progressive forces contended that the spirit of the constitution was as the majority directed it was the majority wish to have tenure it was not a legal issue they argued it was a matter of ethics jackson should declare himself ineligible as a candidate and rule on the validity of tenure as the convention waited with hushed voices jackson promised to settle the issue once and for all first he quoted from the opinion of a t walden convention attorney     based upon my understanding of the ordinary meaning of the word we should think that the amendment tenure would not be properly adopted    president jackson then referred to roberts rules of order he quoted any measure adopted contrary to the constitution of the body is null and void therefore said the president in light of the  record which shows that the socalled revised constitution was adopted on the wrong day i rule that the socalled revised constitution is null and void and the only valid constitution that the convention has is the constitution of  jackson thus ruled himself back into office as his last words fell all hell broke loose and no one could stem the tide amid cries no no no ministers broke down and wept the jacksonites broke into cheers and shouts fists were raised and the air literally shook with rage delegates were on their feet propelled by the tension and disorder rev q l jones then pastor of the fourth street baptist church owensboro ky swung into action trucks had been waiting outside with banners for jackson with a trained crew of delegates jones swept into the auditorium with regal banners proclaiming jackson for president preceded by a bass drum the marchers snaked victoriously around the auditorium a struggle was made for the microphone and the jackson forces commandeered it i move that we suspend the rules and reelect our president by acclamation shouted dr t s harten of brooklyn all those in favor say aye  directed another one of the vicepresidents a second wave of anger struck the antijackson forces the election was being called for a full day before it was programmed the jackson people were going to take advantage of the noise and turmoil and declare a reelection by acclamation it was an old convention trick so strong were the voices raised on both sides that the ayes could not be distinguished from the nays both blended into an indistinguishable roar the ayes have it screamed the moderator of disorder and have it they did the jackson forces had broken the back of tenure what had brought about this bid for power on jacksons part critics claim it to be a messianic complexa desire to be considered the deliverer of the negro masses as pastor of the great olivet baptist church in chicago j h jackson lived for power and recognition they said then enters martin_luther_king jr in denver colorado  a beaming president led a shy young man down the aisles to the strains of onward christian soldiers it was an inspiring sight president jackson introduced young king to the convention in glowing terms king was at the peak of his popularity and captivated the audience his brilliant address on that occasion letter to america was masterfully delivered his father martin_luther_king sr strode with pride at the back of the auditorium as he listened his pride in his son would not allow him to sit down he glanced around at the delegates to see the effect his boy had upon them what he saw there was the same thing that joseph harrison jackson sawa possible black moses the crowd did not want to let the young man go from that moment negro baptists had an idol martin_luther_king had added the national baptist convention usa inc as another of his conquests critics of jackson point to this as the moment jackson made his decision to remain at the helm of the negro baptists the fact that king posed a threat to jacksons popularity was unquestioned a new day was dawning in the struggle for civil_rights and the technique of active protest was beginning to bear fruit and to capture the imagination of the nation king had done what no other negro had done up to this time he stood as the symbol of negro solidarity one of jacksons critics rev joseph kirkland of philadelphia stated in denver after listening to king jackson felt his power slipping from his grasp that plus the issue of tenure warned him that he was facing oblivion rev owen d pelt statistician of the convention and a long time jackson supporter rejected this type of thinking on the contrary he stated king merely echoed the philosophy that jackson had been preaching for years besides jackson was too intelligent to become a victim of petty jealousy whatever the reason the impact of king was sufficient enough to cause a groundswell toward new leadership the indecisive status of tenure helped to create the swell kings supporters recognizing the potential political power that he could exercise within the convention jockeyed him into position to compete for leadership the next year at the annual sunday school and btu congress kings name was offered in nomination for the vicepresidency of that body his popularity was made evident when all candidates for that office withdrew in his favor it was apparent to all that king was being groomed to take over the convention today neutral observers say it was unfortunate that king and jackson were thus pitted against each other many men who backed king were bitter fading ministers who feared that jackson would destroy their own ambitions for leadership the young supporters of king began a campaign against jackson on the charge that he was like uncle tom jacksons leadership was discredited as being weak on civil_rights and strong on dictatorship by the same token king came in for criticism his role many contended was too large to enable him to enter factional denominational considerations as a world renown figure he was diminishing his standing by playing the part of a conventional churchman he didnt need the convention nor did the convention need him in the years following jacksons reelection the conflict of philosophies concerning the struggle for human rights broke out even jacksonites were surprised when jackson allegedly made a statement condemning sitin demonstrations whereas there had always been supporters for jackson and supporters for king a third group of uncommitted ministers were able to view both men in perspectivejackson as a church man and king as a negro leader of the masses it was this third group that began to drift away from jackson jackson insisted that he was quoted out of context what he had really said he argued was that protest was not enough what still remains a mystery is why jackson had miscalculated the mood of the day the angry reaction that set upon him threatened to shake the foundation of his administration a progressive movement in the convention began to develop in  the entire nation was caught up in the negro rebellion this was the mood of the day the negro church had entered the fray with enthusiasm it was against this backdrop that j h jackson began his own delayed program of freedom first he presented to the convention a plan to buy farmland in tennessee during the tent city crisis the purpose was to aid negro farmers in gaining independence from the white man this plan was labeled by the progressives as a booker t washington approach which history records as let down your buckets where you are his critics seized upon this new jackson venture with relish old man jackson has a farm   they chanted it was ironic they contended that in an age of sitins wadeins and standins jackson dared to stage a farmin the next venture by dr jackson in support of his protest is not enough thesis was to export negro families to liberia to teach the people of that country by example how to live and farm as christians followers deserted him in droves as he seemed to focus his attention on farms rather than on the immediate problems of the day ironically jacksons proposals coming at any other time in history would have probably met with unanimous approval however with the intense struggle for civil_rights taking place and virtually no support from the jackson administration he was exhibiting a masterful flair for illtiming leadership was lying heavily upon his shoulders jackson fought hard to gain attention with steady lack of success in june  he amplified his position on protest is not enough with his now famous address the american struggle in the american way this address was called by the progressives a masterpiece of tomism while the civil_rights movement shook up america the national baptist convention usa inc waited by july   lunch counters had been integrated since the start of the sitins the convention waited while core opened its interracial training institute on nonviolence in miami florida nine southern states reported  cities with integrated eating facilities in midaugust by this time martin_luther_king jrs name had become a household word the original idea of his assuming leadership in the conventional negro church was discarded his pulpit became every city that called upon him to inspire negro youth and to challenge the imbedded structure of segregation and discrimination defiantly he marched against police dogs and fire hoses with thousands behind him he was led time and time again to jail his appearance at any gathering electrified both the imagination and the aspiration of the negro masses as a statesman he had quietly ignored the rapierlike thrusts from his erstwhile rival at the same time jacksons lack of support for the revolution was not ignored by young progressive churchmen in every major city of the nation meetings were held alliances and strategy were formed and outlined a new battle cry was formulated jackson must go now dr gardner taylor preparing for the big push to oust jackson added his voice to those of the militants tomorrow libraries parks theaters will face the same choice integration or disintegration it appeared that time for the doctrine of patience had passed after successfully riding through his second fouryear term dr jackson prepared to make his stand for another term philadelphia the city of brotherly love was chosen as site of the next election the progressives conceding that jackson would run again searched for and found a new candidate gardner taylor pastor of the member concord baptist church brooklyn n y was their man like jackson he was a gifted orator and an attractive candidate some jackson supporters tried in vain to get taylor to withdraw as a candidate he was warned that if he was defeated his chance of ever becoming president was gone he was young they informed him he still had time let jackson have another four years taylors day would come gardner taylor was cast in the mold of a fighter he was the first negro member of the new york city board of education he was also the first negro president of the new york state council of ministers tall handsome and militant he was tailor made as a jackson opponent a major attraction was his identification with martin_luther_king jr by this time young king was the leader of the southern christian leadership conference the clamor for king as possible president of the convention had long since diminished prior to the annual session in philadelphia jackson and taylor skirmished briefly at the sunday school and btu congress once again jackson was expounding on his favorite theme patience as the delegates flocked to the new battlefield in philadelphia it soon became apparent that the taylorking forces were strong philadelphia was the political stronghold of rev marshall shepard former state legislator and recorder of deeds in washington d c shepard was an avid worker and arranger for taylor and he worked against jackson with a passion he had reason to jackson had disposed of him as chairman of the foreign mission board taylor was also supported by dr sandy ray president of the new york state convention these large eastern voting blocs far removed from jacksons political strongholds of the south and midwest were watched with deep anxiety by jackson supporters both sides immediately sought ground rules for the election the electoral procedure which had been customary was deplored by the taylor team this procedure worked in the following manner after the president would make his annual address a vicepresident would make a motion that the rules be suspended and the president would be reelected by acclamation the progressives claimed that this method was unfair undemocratic and had steamroller elements give all the delegates the right to cast ballots they contended and let their votes be recorded as they vote by states the agreement was made all delegates were informed that the election would be conducted by states the ground rules worked out by both parties likewise included an agreement that the nominating committee selected by the president would bring in two namestaylor and jacksonand the delegates would then vote for the man of their choice the taylor team was ready the jackson forces were waiting and the events that followed were almost unbelievable on tuesday contrary to the supposed agreement concerning the dual submission of names by the nominating committee the taylor forces were caught offguard when the committee reported only one name    j h jackson moving quickly before the delegates could retain their balance the committee went on without asking for nominations   from the floor they moved that their report be adopted with a unanimous vote for the reelection of jackson this maneuver must be viewed from two positions  the body had voted earlier that the election would be by states and  the report was made prior to the time of the schedule outmaneuvered and betrayed the taylor team resorted to the only means of protest leftbedlam we want taylor we want taylor they chanted in unison we want to vote and we want to vote by states they chorused someone cut the microphone cord jackson turning to the large choir ordered them to sing the chanting grew louder accompanied by the songs of the church churchmen were on a rampage jackson facing a dead microphone attempted to read his annual address and everyone knew that the election would follow this address sit down the taylor contingent shouted we dont want to hear you we want to vote and we want to vote by states they screamed in the middle of his opening statement the premature report of the nominating committee had set up the tempest it was clear to the taylor team what had to follow they moved to prevent it as jackson attempted to deliver his annual address a bass drum was brought in and taylor banners were marched behind the booming drum taylor balloons were released the president struggled to be heard but after a few sentences he realized the utter futility of going on and skipped to the end paragraph he read with a flourishbut it was unheard the coup de grace followed during the bedlam a motion was offered that the report of the nominating committee be received and adopted what followed this motion will never be clearly determined those who were standing close to the platform heard the motion and meanwhile the majority of the delegates were still shouting we want taylor remembering that the mike was dead and with the delegates in turmoil it was surprising to all when the news spread that jackson had been reelected alice dunnigan reporting the scene for the pittsburgh courier described the proceedings as follows the place was in such a hubbub that no one knew what was going on martin_luther_king approached the press table to inquire about the reelection of jackson he was startled when reporters sitting directly in front of the platform replied that there had been no election there must have been retorted king i just met rev jackson leaving the hall and he told me he just had been reelected this raised an inquiry among the reporters as to how and when the president had been elected when the news shifted back to the crowd that the election was over a jackson vicepresident was rapping the convention into adjournment until the evening session the angered taylorites increased the fervor of their demonstration it was at this point that jackson left the hall and notified king he had been reelected gardner taylor standing tall in the midst of his supporters yelled after jacksons retreating form the worst days of hitler never matched this if negroes stand for this they will let the world know they are not prepared for leadership but they will not stand for this    they will have an election god help us prayed an old minister the taylorites with jackson gone moved quickly this meeting is not adjourned shouted dr sandy ray please hold your seats this meeting is not adjourned he repeated this over and over again we are going to have an election and were going to vote by states a roar of approval went up from the delegates jackson meanwhile had locked himself in his convention office reporters seeking to interview him were hustled off by his bodyguards alice dunnigan further reported some persistent reporters hung around the door and buttonholed the selfappointed president as he departed for his hotel he assured reporters that his election had been conducted legally under the terms of the conventions constitution he blamed dr marshall shepard the philadelphia counselman for the disorder implying that shepard had declined to keep order in the hall declaring that the city of brotherly love was the most inhospitable city in which the convention had ever met he stated that it would never come to philadelphia again as long as he was the president while jackson was making his declaratory statement the delegates were filing in arranging themselves by states and the convention was coming to order they were determined to have an orderly election rev c v johnson illinois state president and one of the national convention vice presidents was selected to conduct the election the election results were not surprising there were  votes for taylor and  for jackson the convention now had two presidents when the time for the evening session approached jackson entered the hall to preside taylor was standing beside him the police were called neither side would yield when the police inspector remarked that the situation was embarrassing to him one of the delegates yelled up to him if you had stayed out of here you wouldnt be embarrassed were baptists and we have a right to fight among ourselves without your help in spite of this brief moment of humor which was appreciated by both sides the wounds in the ranks of the negro baptists probed deep into the heart of its church the year  found two men claiming the presidency the conclusion with elements of tragedy was consummated in kansas city kansas the next year the  convention was called to order by dr jackson the taylor team had decided to fight through another medium the courts however the taylor contingent could not contain its anger while jackson was presiding disorder broke out it began when dr e c estell of dallas texas presented a resolution requesting jackson to allow his name to be voted on again as president of the convention stomping and yelling the taylor forces became so disorderly that the director of the auditorium begged the mayor of the city to appeal to the convention i am ashamed the mayor stated to know that you call yourselves christians you are bringing disgrace upon your city and upon your race the taylor forces went to court it was their intent to have a courtordered election with court supervision the court obliged it ordered that all delegates who had registered with both sides be recognized it ordered that dr d a holmes of kansas city supervise the election both sides agreed the orderly election that followed lasted until the early hours of the morning the final results were jackson  votes and taylor  the fire that burned in the convention had upset the church world the memory of the bitter struggle will never be forgotten in spite of the customary congratulations of the vanquished to the victor the ranks have never been closed the cuts were too deep negro baptists have formed a new convention and have discovered that the power struggle has caused irreputable harm in the meantime joseph harrison jackson stands at the helm of the majority without the obstacle of tenure which has never been reintroduced it is now predicted that he will remain there for life his enemies bitterly recall his concluding sentences in his controversial american struggle in the american way  as christians we must accept and employ those methods that are just seasoned in love and based on the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of god the church cannot be used as a rubber stamp for every method employed in the name of democracy and freedom the church must not wait for others to begin a movement for human betterment the church is a revolutionary movement and gods prophets and gods ministers have historically been those who have come to turn the world upside down true his critics respond however even those words were directed against the militancy of the negroes who march toward freedom thus this nation has witnessed the dramatic performances of two men who in ordinary times would have made their marks in history without debatejackson with his ideas on production and king with his emphasis on creative protest however neither man lives in ordinary timesnor are they ordinary men their feud continues both in chicago and in the minds of negroes who have been further torn asunder by the new cry of black_power it remains for history to reveal which man and what instrument finally delivers the negro one thing is certain if the entire civil_rights movement could be cast as a play and produced in a theater that contained todays negroes both men would be standing in the wings to receive their accolades martin_luther_king jr without a doubt would receive a standing ovation joseph harrison jackson if granted one curtain call for his performance would undoubtedly bow to applause however feeble
it is consistent with the i f colonial mindset to £ experiment on and tinker with the lives  and fortunes of those who serve as the exploited when a fire breaks out and the house is burning down only the colonial mind could recommend the placing of whatever firefighting resources as are available on one corner of the back wall in order that we can learn to do at least one portion of the task as well as we possibly can yet such is the spirit of approaches to the massive needs of the urban poor through the sustained device of minuscule pilot projects in education and in employment it is consistent with a colonial mind which would build sustained weakness into urban life to launch a massive head start program for children when these same children must live in homes where fathers are not first equipped to provide the means of livelihood urban problems are rooted in the adult environment and not in the environment of children the experience of the best efforts at the reclamation of children has been that after a few months of academic success the weight of limitations of home life has placed the largest numbers back where they were but with the ingredient of added frustration churches which approach the problems of city life with programs for children do not get at the heart of the urban condition they waste money kill valuable time and come through in the long run as an affrontery to our urban minorities who while accepting often the proffered largesse perceive that the churches think of their needs in terms of the needs of children our churches have far too long shared in and augmented the colonialist mind which has spent and desecrated the resources of our cities our churches have failed to develop programs which build in the power and substantial interchange needed for urban rebuilding like colonialists generally they have perceived of their own kind as privileged they have seen the white clergy as fit to minister to urban minorities but have not built an equitable twoway street for the professionals of minorities to minister to those of the white sub urban majority the negro clergy long have chafed under a system of rank colonialism which sees the unspoken power of white people limit them to less than what their creator intended them in immediate terms to be one overriding fact should be clear we cannot be change agents unless we are willing to be changed ourselves what can our churches do to effect some measure of substantial regeneration in the life of our cities  they may begin to recognize the unconscious burdens and predispositions of a colonial mindset which they bring to the concerns of urban life white people do not necessarily consciously seek to limit the lives of negroes yet the clear facts are that the force of their efforts in urban problem areas has been such that with increased interest the intensity of the problems of the black urban masses has increased for example housing and school segregation in the north has increased the dollar income gap between negroes and whites has increased school failures have spiralled negro males have progressively faired worse in relation both to white males and negro and white females thus placing greater strains upon negro family life the growing restlessness in our slums attests to the fact that things are acutely felt to be getting worse rather than better an america which sees the negro in terms of exploitation unconsciously exploits racism and exploitation of those who happen to be at the bottom of the social and economic pyramid are parts of our cultural pattern we are born into our colonialistminded culture and only as we are aware of its power and place in our lives can we become freer agents within our cultural setting this is an education task of major proportions to be undertaken within the white community itself  we can recognize the need for power for selfdirected selfdevelopment on the part of those who inhabit our cities resources for urban rebuilding from without are wasted unless those who reside in our cities first are empowered for selfperpetuating improvement in the affairs of city life facilitation must therefore be given to the fullest development and expression of the latent power of the black urban masses bishop john bright of the african methodist episcopal church writes all of us know so well that power is merely to do things to move things to control things to direct to create to destroy the desire of negro america to get black_power is not to destroy america but to do great things for america to move america forward yes to control part of america like all other ethnic groups to help direct the affairs of america to be creative american citizens yes to destroy the bigots the social ills political ills the economic ills  racial ills and to drive them from the shores of america our churches may work to encourage black pride black solidarity and promote a sense of the importance of the investment of black people in america white americans have worked to weaken the negro and to destroy his sense of worth if our cities are to be renewed programs in housing education employment and black solidarity need to be aggressively fostered some such programs are discussed in my black_power and urban unrest hawthorn books inc new york   we can create mechanisms for authentic communication this is a basic and continuing need for all aspects of our national and globallife the development and refinement of such devices may well represent the greatest contribution to the common good which our generation may devise our churches can begin in this direction in such efforts on the urban scene  we may focus upon the adult environment of our inner cities as representing the area of greatest need new vehicles for continuing openended adult education and retraining are needed throughout our society collegiatetype communityoriented educational reclamation and fulfillment institutions should be developed in a massive way and located foremost in the heart of every major negro community in america i have detailed elsewhere the broad implications of such an enterprise for many segments of the nations life this should represent the coming major educational thrust in america our churches may take a lead in seeing that this is done either those who reside in our urban slums are reclaimed and rehabilitated in terms of life and livelihood pursuits or they become an increasingly heavy deadweight to retard the forward development of our cities  we must recognize that massive problems call for solutions of appropriate proportions our churches should work together wherever this is possible but the timidity colonialism or lack of vision of one or more denominations should not restrict the ready enterprise of others  we must be open to change we must listen to negroes and accept their formal leadership not only in the vital area of urban affairs to which they hold the key but also in every other area of our common life our cities are in peril material resources of such massive proportions as suggested by the  senate hearings on urban blight undoubtedly are greatly needed but alone such resources will not suffice the key element in urban regeneration is the human element as represented by the black urban masses their exploitationboth conscious and unconsciousmust cease at no place than in the life of our cities is the scriptural admonition more appropriate that he who would save his life must lose it only under such circumstances of clear and determined commitments in word and deed to human growth and fulfillment may there be any hope of enduringly effective urban evangelism once our unconscious and pervasive colonial mindset in regard to city life is cast aside the urban condition of increasingly ominous blight may be changed to that of largely selfdirected growth for good
ver since black e t a m ericansforefap thers were technically  freed from slavery  there has existed a conflict as how best to come to terms with this whitedominated society stripped to its essentials the conflict has been between those who propose integration and those who propose ethnocentrism as a solution now for other minority groups these two solutions have not been incompatible america after all is a pluralist society and a study of the history of those minorities ie irish italian and jewish who have made it clearly indicates that the growth of ethnic separatism is a precondition for eventual penetration into ruling circles and full economic integration theoretically then there is no good reason why most black americans should not be able to live simultaneouslyas most white americans doin two worlds one integrated and the other for the most part separated however in practice the black man has not been able to live in the best of the two worlds and the main reason that this conflict this unnatural division in our ranksis still with us is that white people through their institutions labor unions foundations the press local and federal governments etc have taken sides with the integrationists discrediting black ethnocentrism they have shoved forward the integrationists as the responsible black leaders mesmerized by white acceptance and ignoring history the integrationists have failed to see the need to develop their own communities as a base of power they have urged black people to submerge their unorganized numbers in coalitions dominated by other organized groups and they have urged black people to disperse themselves in white communities not realizing that a people have to know who we is before they can start effectively dealing with them and they they have not realized that first you consolidate then you integrate until recently the ethnocen trists organizations have not been able to compete on an equal basis with the integrationists organizations unable to get money and acceptance from white institutions ironically the ethnocentrists have been unable to attract those black people with the skills necessary to carry out their programs while generally the ethnocentrists organizations have been wellmeaning for instance the muslims they have most often been simply ineffective thus instead of having two equals complementing each other an imbalance has occurred however with the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc and the congress of racial equality core embracing black_powera more poetic way of saying ethnocentrismthe necessary balance is being created that is why their presence on the scene is such a healthy sign it is one thing for the naacp to pit itself against the muslims and yet another thing for it to pit itself against core core like sncc has left the civil_rights movement to join the negro movement the volatile sncc with its charismatic stokely carmichael the pragmatic core with its phlegmatic floyd mckissick while core no longer has the white beatnik image it had during the early sixties it is still in a period of transition there is about it that mixture of audacity and ambivalence which accompanies each whats a black revolution why simply stated it means a renaissance a new awakening of the black conscience its black_power the securing of the necessary power to change our lives and to decide what we want for ourselves    the black revolution is a force for good a force for change the black revolution has six goals  economic power more and better jobs  an improved selfimage for the black man  development of a militant intelligent educated and dedicated leadership  political power  enforcement of federal laws that protect the rights of all men and abolition of those laws that are used to punish people because they are black  consumer power the development of a black consumer block to be used against those commercial forces who fail to recognize black people employ them and fail to give them franchise    core has  members in  chapters scattered all over the country it is ruled by the national convention which meets annually and is composed of representatives from the various local chapters virtually autonomous the local chapters form cores real strength and give it the flexibility that a national organization needs for although black people form a distinct group in this country with similar problems housing education employment police brutality lack of capital etc the intensity and refinement of these  problems vary from one part of the country to another in harlem one of the problems is that black people do not really own any property residential or business but this might not be true of black people in atlanta or chicago also black people in one region of the country might be further along in their development obviously the southern black man has a keener sense of community and is less apathetic than the northern black man additionally in one city it might be feasible for black people to ally themselves with democrats in another it might be in their best interest to side with republicans and in another it might be best to act independent of either party by virtue of its independence each local chapter is able to decide which problems will be attacked first of course having autonomous local chapters can also create difficulties for it places a strain on the national office in terms of overall strategy and programs this means that the national director must have that special quality of being able to follow and lead at the same time mckissicks whole life seems to have been a preparation for this job mckissick was influenced by two ministers one a methodist the other a baptistboth were my grandfathers he smiles both were great talkers and i used to listen to them they talked about things like the inalienable rights of men and mans right to be free subjects like that from listening to them i began to develop my own philosophy and there was also the inner security that comes from parents love his father a jack of all trades worked at such jobs as bellhop and waiter before becoming an insurance salesman his mother worked as a cashier for him to have become a school teacher would no doubt have utterly pleased them both during world war ii he married and served in europe as a technical sergeant after the war he returned to the campus to complete his education he attended morehouse college where he met martin l king jr got to know whitney young then at atlanta university and the legendary sugarfoot the boston celtics sam jones when both attended north carolina college he joined his first protest group during this period the fellowship of reconciliation a group to which bayard rustin also belonged his apprenticeship included participation in numerous sitins picket lines and other demonstrations long before they became camp mckissick also joined the naacp and served as the north carolina youth director in  mckissick achieved national recognition by becoming the first black student to graduate from the university of north carolina law school if the harassment he underwent at the university of north carolina dead frogs in his room water in his locker and a live snake in his bed was not a matter of public record one could imagine him going to law school simply to save money from lawyers fees for his whole family has been in jail and his childrenjoycelyn andree floyd jr and charmainwere the first black children to attend white elementary junior high and high school in durham n c in fact the mckissick family is almost totally involved in the movement a conversation that begins with mckissick at the office may be completed at the dinner table where the family has gathered the mckissick family lives uptown harlem in a home that is comfortable without being pretentious guests are entertained downstairs in an elongated room whose one excess is the huge mahogany desk from behind which mckissick presides directly behind the desk looms a fireplace to the left a bookcase and to the right a banner with large bold letters proclaiming black_power one evening simply by chance a rare occurrence movement peopie letting their hair down and talking about the movement as if an outsider was not present we had come to dinner with bob gore and later found ourselves with ruth turner and mckissicks eldest daughter joycelyn bob bought a fifth of bourbon mckissick acted as the disc jockey and played his favorite s bessie smith jimmy reed tampa red lightnin hopkins leadbelly lulu reed    slowly names of towns like danville wilmington and charlotte and names of people like bo johnson williams johnny and spike filled the room grim southern apparitions emerging from the past who seemed so at home in harlem oh daddy you remember spike remember he was the one who always wanted to be first in line    remember hey floyd man how about that time in danville remember what that cracker sheriff said boy that sure was a mean cracker   yeah    and johnny you remember johnny he used to sing all the time what ever happened to him johnny johnny simpson yea thats him what ever happened to him i dont know  you know he was never the same after they whipped him that last time never the same ill never forget the way  he looked when he first came out of the hospital but in a way i guess he was lucky    remember what they did to bo when the evening is finished the outsider is filled with so many questions what manner of men are these movement people outnumbered by their opposition and all but unknown by the very people for whom they fight what inner force sustains them but when the evening ends there is a sense of relief too around true believers there is not much comfort for the outsider besides there is something disquieting in being confronted with the knowledge that your people are in a real war with real blood being spilled and you have been but a spectator days later back at the national office mckissick who travels a lot and often works late in the night nods until there is talk of black_power and its effects upon core then his dark eyes become alert and his mind alive he discusses the new core black people began to control core in  prior to that the national board was predominantly white now only one white person serves on the board so in a sense core has been moving towards black_power for some time causing many whites to leave the organization however they are being quickly replaced by black people who are attracted to core because of its black_power stance and cores membership is actually increasing but with core fast becoming a black organization a money problem has been created the various foundations as they have done so often in the past have again taken sides they give their money to the urban league and the naacp in terms of program black_power has forced core to gravitate towards those with the greatest needs the black poor core has become involved in programs like the grand marie project in louisiana a sweet potato cooperative and has helped to elect several black people to political office in louisiana mississippi and georgia in baltimore there is the quite successful target city project a program geared to organize black people into effective economic and political power blocs demonstrations are no longer the only weapon used by core and while cores basic philosophy has not changed it is aimed more directly toward aiding and involving black people of course the slogan black_power does raise some larger questions of tactics and timing there is such a thing as italian power jewish power irish power anglosaxon protestant power etc and that it is not perpetuated by chance nor specifically ordained by god on a national level anglosaxon protestants control the military communications media political and bankingindustrial institutions further in new york city the jews control education the italians control construction and the irish control the police between them the jews and italians split the clothing industry night clubs and entertainment and the rackets therefore there also is a need for black people to have power but while one can agree with the concept of black_power one can still question the slogan black_power itself other groups do not talk about their power they practice it once a group really has power there is little need to refer to it by its brand name nor is it good tactics to tell your plans to your opponent and sometimes to tell the truth is poor politics mckissick argues that black_power is like a slogan that sells a product and that black_power is meant to be a dialogue between black people but is it really selling the product and how would it have been if the slogan black_power had been allowed to develop in the black community like the word soul the same general arguments used against black_power can be used against soul  it is racist  it does more harm than good since you always have to explain and define it  it isolates black people from the mainstream etc ad nauseum  however the term soul was allowed to develop in the black community black people did not first learn about it on tv or read it in the papers it was theirs for years before whites were aware of it time however might work in favor of the term black_power for black_power implies an awareness that other groups have power and in this sense it is a realistic appraisal of components of the power structure america has a great capacity for absorption and soon black_power will join other poetic expressions soulful groovey hip funky square swinging etc that blacks have coined and contributed to the language already there is talk of green power mckissick is aware of all this he realizes that one can be used on television while attempting to use it and already he speaks of limiting his television appearances organizing the black community will be tedious and unglamourous and there are no short cuts for the hard work involved when asked the direction that core will take in the future he cited the six goals of the black revolution refusing to be more specific he smiled and said its time for a lot of moving without saying too much it is as if he has felt the times pulse for the movement has had its verbal orgies the time for shouting deprecations against the white man has come and gone now is the time for getting together  quietly and doing what must be done without a doubt there does exist among us a generation of black people who exude an ineffable air of selfappreciation black consciousness ethnocentrism nationalism negritudeby whatever name it exists whether labeled or not cores ability to significantly involve this group will be one of its major tests for it is a lonely restless generation of nonbelievers looking for a new faith a generation compelled to act even though dramas have not yet been written for it however if core is to survive and remain true to the tenets of black_power it must be financed by black people most of the money must come from the black middle class and this will be cores other major test as long as core was a civil_rights organization money was not the real problem but as we mentioned above cores stance on black_power has alienated a sizable number of white people and while its membership has actually increased its dollar intake has decreased thus core is faced with the complicated task of drawing upon two distinct groups for its support the one militant but undisciplined the other financially stable but politically conservative and acquisitive never having demonstrated in its entire history any interest in supporting black institutions it will be a tough row to hoe if core favors the militants it risks losing the conservatives and hence its financial support if it favors the conservatives it risks losing the militants and its position in the avantgarde additionally there is the opposition that will come from the white community and the integrationists who will be vying with core for the support of the black masses but floyd mckissick seems the man for the job since he has become national director he has shifted the direction of core as well as its location and when mckissick speaks of a black revolution and says that the civil_rights movement is deader than a door knob we know he exaggerates not from arrogance but to make us begin thinking of ourselves not as we are but as we can be
home black inlectuals the gen£ eration is changing  come home black intellectuals the white mans conditioning of black minds is cracking at the seams come home black intellectuals recondition the young to drive for maximum effort in the development of their minds come home black intellectuals and help reeducate and reorient your people come home black intellectuals before you are relegated to that sterile eternity the historical footnote the generation is changing and the negro intellectual who in many instances seems a pale copy of his white counterpart can no longer play at being white by imitating the white mans culture in every way which is often so alien to the negro mind the negro intellectual who should be the leader among his people must turn within and seek those positive and constructive things about himself and his people and build his and his own peoplesself respect for the newlyawakened generation does not accept many of the standards of the white culture as being the only good and right patterns of human behavior the newlyawakened black generation is bent on establishing itself as a vital and moving force in american society not under the enlightened leadership of whites or under the leadership of puppet negro leaders who dance at the ends of oligarchic strings which control them the conditioning of the negro mind has for over  years deprived him of his manhood and individuality but with each succeeding generation the degree of conditioning has lessened moreover the authoritarian personality structure of the american white male and the negro female which has in the past operated to reinforce and sustain submission is on the wane traditionally these personality structures only allowed for the most part the more conservative negro leadership however with the young negro generation of today this kind of leadership will not be tolerated for it has cast aside the humble withdrawn role of the negro for the role of a man in his own right many of the rearguard conservative negro intellectuals today comprise much of the negro middle class which generally has tried to remove itself from the negro masses as a consequence of this selfimposed removal the demand for leadership among negroes for negroes has brought forth a group of leaders of a less welleducated and less sophisticated character such a development cannot just be said to be bad for the negro but tragic it would seem that the negro intellectuals duty is to do some deep soulsearching and to remove himself from his comfortable middleclass niche and render unto his people for the present generation of negroes and those to come will be less conditioned to a white standard of beauty to a white standard of good and bad to a white standard of culture where these standards find their authority for action based on a whitedefined christian religion which identifies white as purity and good black as base and foul the negro intellectual must be reminded that among the young negro females it is no longer a point of pride to have a white mans child or one as mixed and nearwhite as possible they have realized that to desire such a thing is an admission of selfimposed inferiority and leads to degrees of selfhate the negro intellectual must be reminded that he has indeed been out of contact with niggertown desperately running from the black culture that gave him life the negro intellectual must be reminded that only the strong have endured from his african parentage that the conditions under which his forebears endured did not permit the weak to survive the negro intellectual must be reminded that though the traditional conditioning and brain washing practices of the white majority have been formidable they could little have changed nor reversed the process of nature once set in motion short of complete extermination of the negro in this country finally the negro intellectual must be reminded that if he does not recognize these practices and processes and reassume leadership his leadership will become something out of time and date negro intellectuals have for years stepped around the problem of the mothercentered organization of many lower class negro families in a culture which sustains a fathercentered system negro intellectuals have failed their people relative to the disadvantageous position of the negro male as family man the fact that divorce laws may be just in a white culture does not make them just for negroes when family organization among many negroes is the reverse of that of most whites especially when the negro males ability to exploit opportunities in the job market is not equal even to that of many negro females and the sad part of this entire pattern has been the negro intellectuals refusal to point out to both the negro and to whites that the negro females improved opportunities have existed alone because of the white mans peculiar relationship to her but the nonintellectual black male recognizing this problem on  his own level has dealt with it in a crude destructive but effective manner witness the high divorce rate among negroes witness the degree of welfare support to fatherless families witness the high degree of illegitimacy witness the gross disrespect for females by many males of the lower class the negro intellectual must be reminded that this is perhaps the first generation in which the negro male is bent on assuming his posture as a man and that the nature of the family unit may well be the cause of the new rationale he is well aware of his proscribed position in american society he sees christian society operated seemingly alone for white people he has witnessed numbers of his women sell out their own people at the expense of the negro males selfimage he realizes he must defend a country that seemingly still is bent upon using his black back as a work horse and he is aware of the fact that the white man fears the black males acquisition of power because of the degraded place assigned to black males throughout american history finally he is aware of the fact that the white man has sold himself a sense of superiority which when lost causes great mental difficulty for him small wonder that the young negro generation seems committed to either complete emancipation or destruction negro intellectuals should not forget that it is they who have helped to reinforce the opinion that there is nothing worse than an educated fool they should not forget that it is they who have allowed the attitude that motherwit and common sense are to be valued over trained intellect and competency in trade or professsion they should be reminded that the young generation is little interested in turning the other cheek or mumbling prayers to heaven for deliverance but is belching expletives and bent on their own selfdeliverance by whatever means are possible come home black intellectuals for the brutal fact of life in this midtwentieth century is that the world today is a world given over to racism it does not matter practically speaking whethor not it is right or wrong it does not matter practically speaking if it is against the laws of god it does not matter practically speaking if there are mountains of evidence that there are no great differences in the native potentials of the three major divisions of human stock come home black intellectuals for what does matter in the here and now is that racism is on the ascendency racism is like a religion a belief this is a fact of life which the american negro is going to have to learn to live with moreover it is not likely that racism will be eradicated from the minds of men in the next few decades or tens of decades for that matter come home black intellectuals and help your people seek out their strong points and build a reservoir of pride and self respect come home black intellectuals and be examples for the negros survival in the age of automation may rest on nothing less than allaround superior performance come home black intellectuals
ralph waldo el lison a psychologically sound type of the literarywise who soar but seldom roam holds that there is an argument in progress between black men and white men as to the true nature of american reality indeed neither literary overseers academic elihus nor ethopiam eunuchsall of whom now circulate freely through establishment platforms have known quite what to make of invisible man  mainly because the narratorprotagonist who sets the course of this achievement in fictional variety and verisimilitude is still in the making for whatever its shortcomings ellisons creation is as omificent as anything the modern american novel has produced it is one thing moreover for those presuming to pit life against death to lie down in freudian darkness and set up in glib print it is quite another duly to observe and yet dwell apart from cesspoolbased geysers of pathological obsessions and mock dialogues for ellison and for a good halfdozen other natural sons who happen at once to be novelists and american negroesand even this latter by fiat of the pathology of syncrisisthe essential reality of the human condition reaches beyond the version of those david daiches see his english literature  has justly appraised as fools and freaks hence if through the process that the american novel in the main has become it has degenerated into an imageblurring mirror of nihilistic negations or the american stage excepting arthur miller and the late lorraine hansberry into a reptile house of sickness and shrieking projections the condition can hardly be charged against the negro novelist in his right state beginning at the same scripture he is philip reading nor can the noble tradition of folk simplicity and assertive dignity from which those of trombone timbre as distinguished from that of tamborine neuroses yet draw be done to death the test of a living literature is surely not how often or widely an establishmentlaunched name is dropped orbited and echoed by jamesian scribes but whether its character creations walk in the light of our time for all time and for any fruitful purpose it may well be as chairman of the bookofthemonth club harry sherman contends that the judges of the y earoldcorporatepatrondistributor consider themselves truly representative of the general public and not    apprehensive of the possible unpopularity the presumed unacceptability of any book it may even be that they have read themselves into the state of blessedness which he claims for them and drawn their many millions of the top layers  on the qui vive intellectually unto them this much they have proved on the merit of invisible man and on the canon of diverse quality novels which during the sleepy fifties confirmed the arrival in american letters of a big four among negro novelists they were either insensitive or silent the intense and naturally balanced interplay of comic touch and tragic reality evident in the best of chester himes cast the first stone  and the third generation  in ann petrys wise and comprehensive treatment of tragic love cutting across lines of class and race to be climaxed by a clash of pride the narrows  and in those euripidean pillars of the unshakable wright foundation the outsider  and the long dream  cannot be honestly bypassed nor can such a supporting cast of fleshed and spirited images read into the record through mark kennedys the pecking order  john oliver killens youngblood   and julian mayfields the hit  these novels simply cannot be disposed of by packaging them in superficial surveys warmed over after serving their original purpose as exercises in ph d dissertation writing the logical fruit of this routine mistreatment of some of the most penetrating and permanent writing of the decade immediately behind us is threefold having been led away from it the american clerisy was left without lenses to see the blood on the moon that was to stream down into the streets granted that the relationship between huck finn and nigger jim like that between wolsey and cromwell in shakespeare is a sympathetic portrait and cherished memory but far more lovely and meaningful is that between link williams and camilla treadway sheffield in ann petrys remarkable reworking of the theme central to romeo and juliet and cyrano de bergerac yet it has never occurred to american critics to recognize miss petrys vision as independent of their guidance and control and wherever the negro artist has indicated his unwillingness to serve and preserve their psychological and economic comfort he has been read out of circulation he may of course share fully in their pathological distresses but a seat among the outpatients of the henry james institute of hidden meanings is not to be equated with a place of reasonable comfort next door in fair housing philip the reader moreover is not for bending double in compromise alienation or dense actuality the real contradictions of a life he elects to face are sufficient for his purposes and bearing their reality with their revelations negroes have always lived close enough to privilege to work fight and die in the service of owners or overseers the question now a positive answer to which would certainly clarify if not settle the matter at issue in the human rights revolution on the home front is put from a rooftop response two thousand years after peter by b j the little demon leader in the pecking order anybody kin work fer white folks its livin with um that counts hence if the criticsclerisy eyes be closed arrogant or evil in the reading of literature by negro americans how shall human understanding hearts and houses be opened how else can the american credo be fulfilled or american literature and art be free henry fielding declared himself out not to make bad men good but to make good men wise the stray fruit of criticsclerisy rejection of the negro in literary life reality is expatriation half of americas talented native sons who seek life in creative expression are currently living and dying in old and alien lands himes and mayfield are overseas and death came to wright and willard motley in france and mexico respectively even from these outposts however leopold senghors recent defense and definition of their mission and their poetry the defense and illustration of negritude has held true for it is a gusher that does not run dry a basic significant element of the civilization of the universal which is being constructed before our eyes by us and for us by all and for all a classic example of this is a singularly significant redwood among the tall timbers of american reality fiction the long dream that has been both mistaken and maligned it is nevertheless the essential key to an understanding of two continuously troublesome problems in the coarse texture and strangled style of ghetto existence negro family life and the negros relationship to the law and given the living holocaust in natchez mississippi as of april   which furnished the springboard substance and framework of this misread and bypassed novel no meaningful commentary reportorial or testimonial about root causes of the crises in either our cities or our families can fail to reckon with the disturbing truth it reveals but the sustained irony of the long dream is that its portrait of integrated roguery in blackandwhite has leaped from its pages into the streets and courts of our big cities and naturally beyond the projects of an academic bourgeoise of intellectual posture psychsociological bent and hustling ambition the strange fruit of critics clerisy rejection of lifesize negroes in literature is the kind of marketplace the situation has produced shored up by public ignorance apathy and fear in negrowhite relationships in america a cynical and telepathetic alliance links the widely advertised moynihan report journalist theodore h whites pontifical essays on negroes and hollywoods subtly altered version of the late edward lewis wallants the pawnbroker which went to the moviegoing public with black brock peters in the criminal overlord role the novelist assigned to a sicilian one need only set the above three in juxtaposition to the case of william manchester who wrote about a wealthy and important family and an issue of highest importance to see the helplessness of a people without due recognition in life literature and law a public informed by the best that is in negro literature could not be so misled what the literature of america by its natural sons needs perhaps is a disinterested appraisal such as a david daiches or dennis brogan would be capable of providing the dilemma in american life was not ably diagnosed until gunnar myrdal pulled together what really mattered and wrote a commentary that made sense if it did not make converts to be sure maxwell geismar and lewis mumford have since the sixties begun to challenge the current chaos to return to reality and order or john steinbeck at stockholm delivered the address for our health and recovery but these voices are likewise an overlooked minority
one rather significant multiple offense by other house members has been overlooked during efforts to disqualify a colleague adam clayton powell for defiance of the courts no one even tried to reprimand the  representatives who with  senators had signed the march  southern manifesto that document defied the supreme courts unanimous school segregation decision and initiated a sweeping campaign to dignify defiance of the federal judiciary that has left a bitter heritage its signers were seated without question just a decade ago a moderate education editor recently reported that the nations schools are more separate and less equal than they were  years ago last may commissioner of education harold howe ii is second only to representative powell as a target of congressional wrath as he steers an uncertain course in enforcing the  civil_rights act the southern manifesto itself is fast fading from memory but its effect in inciting disobedience to law lives on when we call on southern officials for compliance they just laugh at us one federal aide is reported to have said in the aftermath of the civil war there had been a precarious balance between bitterness and submission on the part of the white south as eric mckitrick has said carl schurz an officially commissioned observer whose report was ignored ruefully concluded that the opportunity had been lost as soon as president andrew johnson permitted it to be understood that he purposed to restore those states to their selfgoverning functions without preparation the stillexisting proslavery spirit was naturally flushed with new hope the precarious balance reappeared after the school segregation decision senator russell long said at first although i completely disagree with the decision my oath of office requires me to accept it as law the border states prepared to obey the law such groups as the southern regional council called for action by community leaders to prepare for compliance former virginia senator benjamin muse reported desegregation might have been accomplised in many localities before resistance had hardened and it might have forestalled some organized harassment all such hopes were dashed when the southern declaration of constitutional principles was released the apostles of bitterness had overwhelmed the forces that were organizing to encourage respect for law calling the supreme courts decision an abuse of judicial power the congressional signers of the manifesto pledged an unremitting fight against the ruling while the document cautioned against disorder and lawless acts its true meaning was as anthony lewis wrote to make defiance of the supreme court and the constitution socially acceptable in the southto give resistance to the law the approval of the southern establishment the effect on the constitutional rights of millions of our children has been incalculable few in congress gave the manifesto the name it deserved senator clifford case deplored its tendency to incite resistance and oregons richard neuberger declared it underminded the rule of law senator humphrey feared that persistence in denial of equal rights would arouse world indignation but according to william s white disclaimed any intention to admonish his southern friends it remained for salty old pat macnamara to stand up and say this declaration may not be outright sedition but it certainly is subversive in its intent to undermine the integrity of the judicial system of this nation the new house includes  of the  representatives who signed the manifesto they are hardly fit to help determine if cavalier contempt for the law is enough to warrant exclusion of an elected member
several years ago as a negro living in the south i had feelings of grandeur about what the north was like i had been told that it was truly the land of opportunity freedom and wholesome living with those preconceived notions i came north to explore this earthly heaven for myself i have been here five years have watched with great concern and objectivity the conditions have been involved first hand in the social movements and now i have made a decision about where i want to spend the remainder of my life that decision is in the south there are definite reasons why  to be very honest i do believe the north offers greater opportunities and more freedom than the south but all this seems to be misinterpreted by my negro brother the negro in the north seems to view all of this as an achievement end rather than an achieving means since most northern negroes have come from the south by comparison they naturally see the north as superior this seems to create a feeling of having it made the result is appalling apathy negro communities in the north that could be operating at  and  per cent efficiency are operating at  and  per cent efficiency because so few really sense the need yet in the south there are negro communities operating at  and  per cent efficiency while their size structure and pressure would seem to indicate a much smaller percentage the negro in the south knows what has to be done he knows what he has to do he knows that he cannot afford to put his hand to the plow and look back so he keeps plowing what should be of paramount concern to all of us is the kind of future we can look forward to frankly unless things change i have grave skepticism about the future of the negro in the north this is primarily because of his apathy at best the situation now is critical the schools are overcrowded in many systems there are double shifts and there are teenage gangs and more gangs what really disturbs me is that there does not appear to be any cure in sight much of this is brought about because enough interest and concern cannot be generated to pass bond referendums to finance new schools as is the procedure in the midwestern metropolis in which i now live then too many school districts overlap thereby making enemies of property owners against bond referendums because they see the measures as a continuing process and continuing expense about the gangs i wish i could say a good word but one would be hard to find knifings shootings and killings are constantly occuring and all of this is on the increase the gangs are well organized and there are ranks for all members it has been reported that one of the best ways to move up is by inflicting injury and in some cases murder the gangs have just about taken over in the north based upon the pace they are now setting five years will find the north an unsafe place to walk the streets under these conditions i would not be giving my children a fair chance for wholesome survival if i stayed in the north i know the south has its segregated schools but that system is breaking and my knowledge of the south tells me that the break will be solid here again overcrowdedness is not a major problem in the public schools of the south because schools are built with state funds whenever the need arises i know there are gangs in the south but they dont exist to inflict injury and murder is virtually unheard of among teenagers there i also believe a greater sense of value is placed upon human life by negroes in the south this is definitely lacking in the north and perhaps explains why the teenage gangs in the north are so violent more important i believe the negro in the south has a better sense of direction than the negro in the north primarily because he sees the south as a challenge to his ends therefore there is a greater spirit of togetherness it has been said that the most important gift one can have is a sense of perspective and duty im going back to the south because i want to keep that gift
what power is there in christianity to wean men from race prejudice wrote kelly miller the howard university sociologist early in this century in mandate for white christians john knox press  kyle haselden returns to this question which whether asked in simplicity or irony has lost none of its impact for many of those most passionately concerned with combating racial injustice christianity has become a handy synonym for hypocrisy it would be sad if this attitude lost mr haselden some readers among people who would appreciate him most a pastor for many years and currently editor of the christian century and the pulpit he is a serious christian a man who does not shirk the moral implications of his religion or deny that it has been distorted by the uses to which its professors put it christian religious practice has always been a mirror of events never a touchstone of rectitude historians and sociologists can find a key to the special hypocrisies of a period by taking a careful look at what the churches have not stressed the mandate presented to white christians in america troubled as they must be by the failure of their churches as a whole to take a stand on the moral issues of race relations is simple mr haselden recommends christian love in six coherently expressed chapters he presents a remarkably balanced analysis of the complexity of the religious attitudes of white christians the overt bigotry of some christians is not denied but the author is more concerned with guilt by dissociation from the moral issues of racial injustice he writes of the element of coercion in martin_luther_king jrs policy of nonviolence and believes that this coercive element the technique of shaming ones adversary by love is the one that will eventually be effective not surprisingly dr_king has written an appreciative foreword christian love says mr haselden knows no limit in its pursuit of justice he quotes pascalbecause men do not fortify justice they justify forceto bring home the consequences of a failure of this love one such consequence being the practice of scapegoating the temptation to make whipping boys out of symbolic figures like george wallace bull connor and benjamin willis does not absolve those of us whose crimes are less obvious christian love says mr haselden whose intellectual brilliance lights up some carefully shaded recesses of our consciences does not rejoice in the evil that it discovers in men but guilt does there is no way for a white christian to avoid the burden of personal responsibility for the failure of his church or the compromises of his own science mandate for white christians faces the facts but does not in turn fall into the trap of making a scapegoat of the church a white christian need not look beyond the basic tenets of his faith to find a solution to the problem of how to live with his black brother mr haseldens book honest thoughtful and unemotional may help negroes to understand the apparent ambiguity of the white mans attitudes towards them as well as doing something to modify those attitudes in the light of rationality and love

pistol the fat man stood as far away from the counter as possible he and the negro almost huddled in the same spot you better get rid of that there gun the black man in denims told him the bald man

walked out the door pushing the crowd in front but ernie screamed one last remark over his shoulder from inside the store the last thing i heard was the storekeeper asking johnson why johnson could call us boys and he couldnt jfc d£   around two as we passed the liquor store we paused at the corner for the light we watched the girl in pink capris drinking a red soda she and the bald man leaned at the far end of the counter next to the window her pink tongue played in the bottle opening spitting air into the container and plugging the liquid in the end then she would jerk the bottle down swishing the last of the beverage around in the bottom though leaving her tongue tip out pointing redly and moist at the store owner he leaned over the counter the neon coke signs flashing upon his forehead in the store the other clerk closed and locked doors and emptied trash and swept the floor
alxander held the n  £ big box carefully in his  £ hand the subway trin win in s way towards the brooklyn bridge he tried to control the twitching of his left arm he couldnt oh god he said softly to himself if i drop it now but he couldnt think of this no he would have to force himself to forget this box and the jarring jerking movements of the train and too he would have to forget that he was alone and would be even more so after he got to the bridge if only some of the others had come with him but no they wouldnt maybe they would go to the man yes this is what would happen didnt he know negroes that is know that they couldnt be depended uponthat they would shy away from the real mccoy yes this was true and he despised them for it but that was all right he could do it alone if only he could stop thinking about it yes because if his hands kept trembling he might accidentally let go of the box and then it would all be over then and there but suppose he was to get another headache like those which came sometimes to explode his temples into flames suppose this was to happen and suddenly without even knowing it he was to black out no he couldnt think about that either better to think about something else perhaps tomorrow but there too was a dead end tomorrow had always had its drawbacks for him living in the south and forced to walk the thin line between the expedient and the impossible and always aware that there was a real physical force which could with one thought simply on a hunch or a whim smash him at its will had made all of his tomorrows todays and yesterdays no better not think about tomorrow there were none for negroes it was all a myth all of their days were similar they were a timeless people but he had to think about something anything except this box and this train and what would happen after he got to the bridge yes anything but that perhaps then he should think about his father what would his father say now if he were alive and if he could see him on this journey his father would approve he knew that is of the journey and of the need for what had to be done but would his father approve of his doing it he didnt know he had been proud of his father and ofttimes before he would go out to seventh avenue to get up on the stand and speak to the people he would look at his fathers picture and recall those sundays he had sone down to the vacant lot beside bens poolroom and listened to his father speak he recalled that sad pitiful old man waving his arms and banging the wooden rostrum with his bony fists and he recalled too the sound of that voice the hatred which came with the spittle from his lips and the epithets which he aimed at his motley emotional audience the audience tired old men and young bewildered boys had shouted and cheered and sometimes brandished their fists in the air in response to his cajoling for that moment perhaps they were stirred moved made conscious of the futility of their daily existence but this spell could not long remain they had not been revolutionaries but plain simple people who knew only one thing about the class struggle that somehow they were in it and got the worse of it and that it would never be any different and true his father had had no real solution perhaps he had been rightthat is in his own mind perhaps communism was the wave of the future perhaps there in the s at the height of the new deal during the great liberal administration of franklin d roosevelt when one negro was being lynched every week and each negro child was destined to a mental if not physical death by the age of yes perhaps communism or any ism was the answer but his fathers audience these ignorant people had been wiser than their mentor they had seen in the violent revolution not the eventual victory of the proletariat but instead the victory of the power structure which would after a decisive victory go on to emulate the germans and exterminate negroes indiscriminately en masse and they had seen too that there was growing within all of this chaos and disruption a negro bourgeoisie which would dedicate itself to maintaining the status quo and no matter how much they too despised the negro middle class the ones with the fine homes and the big carsthey also on the other hand sought to emulate them and they dreamed of the day when they might be like them and so his father had been defeated because of the inability of his audience to believe after they had left the power of his oratory that the world painted by his words was the real one he was glad that his father had died early he knew that had he lived he would have eventually gone insane or cut his throat yes he believed this because his father was an intellectual and the negro intellectual at some stage of his life is forced to give up his illusions part with his ideals desert the world of mysticism and become immersed in the pragmatic world of harsh cold reality always he walks the thin line between sanity and insanity seeing death not as an awesome antagonist but perhaps as a more comforting alternative to him reality is not that which inspires but instead that which defeats that which pushes one willingly hopefully to his own destruction yes better that his father had died before the death of his illusions better that he had died before he had come to realize that the new day would never be yes he had died at the right timethe train came to a halt at fiftyninth street the sudden stop threw him back against the seat his hand relaxed and the box began to slide down his thigh his eyes opened wide and for a moment he sat almost paralyzed the box fell to the seat and tottered between his legs on the edge he couldnt move he sat there watching it unable to bring his arm around the box tumbled over as the train pulled off the little boy sitting near him on the other side of the seatthe one facing him reached down and caught the box minutes before it hit the floor here your package mistuh he said he opened his eyes mechanically he stretched out his hand thanks he wiped his forehead with the back of his hand then he put both hands tightly around the box he was breathing deeply and the sweat glistened on his high black forehead he glanced at the boy then he looked to the right at a white woman she turned her eyes away he snarled and turned back to the boy did the boy realize how frightened he himself had been could this black boy when handing him the box see by the light of fear in his own eyes that fear also in his no perhaps not perhaps this was the trouble perhaps none of them could really know the others fear and thus each interpreted his own misery in his own way and perhaps too this was why the great union had never been not even in slavery itself had their travails and misfortunes been of general and similar intensity this is why john brown failed this is why the violent revolution could never be each negro interpreted his misery in his own way and measured it according to his own instruments but he would change all of this yes he and his box would set into motion that chain of reactions which would lead inevitably to a final solidification would force negroes to unite in their own common selfinterest suppose he told the boy what he had in that box what he intended to do with it he looked at the tennis shoes sliced at both ends on the boys feet he shook his head when his eyes moved to the dirty blue denim pants and the old torn faded white tee shirt the boy kept his dazed young eyes on the floor alexander carefully slid one hand away from the box and reaching into his pocket brought out a crumpled dollar bill he gave it to the boy thanks the boy said he crumpled the bill in his hands smiling for a moment his face beaming and then finally went back to searching the floor with his eyes a living dead man he whispered turning away from the boy yes a living dead man you couldnt possibly understand me no even though what im going to do is for you yes if it happens and if afterwards there is a new life it will be yours you will have to come up from the rubble and shape a world in your own image but you wouldnt understand no i could never explain it to you the train reached thirtyfourth street and the boy got off walking slowly his head down alexander watched him disappear but no one else had understood him either no none of those who had sat with him in the basement of that dingy roachinfested room in harlem one night after the first riot and these were the rebels these were the men devoted to the destruction of the system £    they had preceded him into the dark dimlylit basement which smelled of urine and served as the nesting place for the lean sleek furry rats which came night and day to assault men women and children three men were there roger watkins tall rangy lanky his hair bushed on his head in the an naturel style of the black nationalists alexander had met roger in a history class at city college scheid ali was also there he was a short fat man with an oval face and small sleepy brown eyes leader of a new religious sect which based its dogma on a far eastern religion his sect stressed the coming destruction of white civilization alexander did not know the third man later he found out that the mans name was james king king was of medium height and had bright skin and soft wavy hair and whereas the others even alexander himself had been shabbily dressed king was neatly almost immaculately attired he wore an ivy league threebutton suit with a conservative looking velvet collar his tie was knotted in the college fashion and the collar of his silk shirt was folded neatly around it he had a bulova watch on his arm its band the same gold color as the big ring which sparkled on  his finger king was the liaison man between many civil_rights groups and sometime before he had organized a march of ministers college teachers and middle class negroes on the capital of a northern state king was speaking as alexander came in i say the riots ruined us there wasnt no sense in it the ones who did the rioting wasnt interested in no civil_rights what can you expect man asked sheid these people got a legitimate bitch against the man what they was stealing was stole before from them maybebut king started to retort roger cut him off these people got no jobs they cant make it nobody can make it without a job so they stole but its our fault because we dont do enough for the people theres enough capital here in harlem for these people to make jobs for themselves thats our problem in a nutshell we dont give the black people jobs but whyd they steal whiskey asked king hunh you tell me that what has whiskey got to do with a murdered negro boy ill tell you replied scheid the black man in america is what the man wants him to be yeah this is their trouble there aint nothing they can do until they break away from him thats malarkey replied king they got nowhere to go and they wouldnt go nowhere anyway you act like this isnt their country it aint interjected watkins ill be damned if its not shouted king waving his hands they came here before most of these damned foreigners yes sir they was here no said scheid they didnt come the man brought them wellall righthave it your way said king anyway theyre here and they are not going anywhere he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and what im saying is that they got to beat mr charlie at his own game and if they work it right they can do it at that moment the men had noticed that alexander was present he greeted them shook hands all around accepted the can of beer and pulled a folding chair from the wall he sat next to scheid across from king the answer king went on is politics we got enough negroes in harlem to damn near run the city but nobody uses this power thats whats wrong use it for what asked scheid the man puts up somebody to run and comes and asks you to vote for him there aint no difference between no two men republican or democrat about the black manbut   no let me finish scheid shouted king down if they had their own state someplace of their own they could elect their own men men who would mean something to their people that aint even it watkins who had been trying to speak before finally broke in they got a state right here in harlem look outside and as far as you can see there aint nothing but black people i say they can build their own businesses set up their own programs and do something for themselves it wont do no good said scheid the white man is doomed with all the blood on his hands god cant possibly let him live naw and if black people stay with him they gonna be doomed too theyve got to break away here alexander had spoken for the first time now we have another god you talk about everything that the man has done but the worst thing is to give us a concept like god jehovah allah economics politics theyre all god man and what we have to do is to get rid of the gods i dont understand you man said king what i mean is that we have to tear down everything the whole structure we cant leave anything standing all of it is rotten youre an anarchist king accused  hes sick watkins said we had this argument before yes he replied and i couldnt convince you then and i wont convince you now but as long as you let this system stand and you worship all of its gods nothing will ever happen there will never be a change no said watkins because too many negroes think like you they down on their own people im down on hypocrites and phonies and i dont give a damn if theyre black or white i know that black children are dying out there in the streets and its just as much your fault as it is the mans king stood up he stretched himself and looked at the others youre all wrong he said you dont give the people enough credit theyve got the man on the run and they can keep him there if they use their power we have no power alexander said weve got nothing but a bible some godhouses and people who dont know how much better off they would be dead he turned his eyes to the ceiling the other men were coming back at him now each shouting to be heard above the other but he no longer heard them the pain had come to deaden the left side of his face would it ever be gone no not really he knew that it would reappear again and again sneaking up on him like a thief in the dark and maybe he didnt want it to be gone maybe  he wanted it to keep coming back to him as a reminder of all that was that had been and that would always be maybe he wanted it to be with him always because in this way he could always hate both that sneering sadistic white face behind the arm which had wielded the gun butt and that cynical snarling look on the black face of the man who had helped to hold him down when the pain had finally subsided he noticed that they werent talking to him any longer they were all examining the contents of a box which watkins had set on a milk crate in the center of the circle this is the mccoy he said this is it what is it he asked take a look said scheid carefully removing the cover from the box for christs sake go easy shouted king alexander bent over and looked into the box then he straightened up quickly shaking his head and bent down to take another look yes he had been right the first time there were six sticks of dynamite each carefully packed some distance from the other the spaces between each stick were filled with cotton whew he exclaimed whats the pitch they all looked at king king stood up and stretched i took it from some goddamn kids who were gonna blow up something  what were they gonna blow up asked alexander i dont know but i talked them out of it king walked away to get a can of beer he came back to the little circle thatd ruin us for sure coming on top of the riots itd finish the movement what are you going to do with it alexander had asked man im lettin it go yeah we gonna call mr charlie and let him see what we got and what we done we gonna show him that some of us got some goddam sense he stood up he looked from the face of king to the others they shook their heads at him they agreed with king he bent down over the box again why we got to give it up he asked then he straightened up i mean why cant we use it no one replied they just looked at him halfdazed halfbewildered i think you crazy man said scheid after awhile no he protested im serious why in the hell dont we use it why dont we show the man just where we at that aint where we at said king and we aint ever gonna go there aint none of us here no murderers we dont agree on some things but that we agree on we aint gonna go that way its the only way he shouted somewhat surprised at the sound of his own voice there is no other way his eyes opened wider the perspiration had begun to roll down the sides of his face he waved his hands frantically in the air the pain had begun again at the base of his temples we cant go no other way he said softly youre a damn fool said king any spook who wants to do something like this is a damn fool he spun around sharply on his heels to confront king no thats not it he shouted through the pain thats not it at all you got no guts no none of you you dont want change we want change shouted king yeah and thats what well get but we dont want no destruction no we dont want to tear down the whole world he moved closer to king the other mans hot breath was on his forehead and so youll never get any change no because until everything is wiped awayall of it you wont have any change damn said king backing away i aint gonna talk to no damn crazy man but he spun around and came back pointing his finger but look how goddam silly the bastard is he appealed to scheid and watkins who had moved away from the two men he thinks six lousy sticks of dynamite can change something yeah he thinks that    hell man said scheid that aint a drop in the bucket to what mr charlie got watkins stood up i aint against revolution you know that im all for it but man you got to have the people with you you need every black man in the country before you can do something like that no alexander replied clenching his fists and spitting the words through his teeth you need one black man who isnt afraid to die just one black man can make it baby yes this one man can make it  he stopped suddenly and yelled the pain flashed across his forehead and for a moment it appeared as though he would fall to the floor scheid and watkins leaped to their feet king moved away from him they stood watching him he pressed his head with the palms of his hands the deep breathing wracked his body when he raised his head again his face was screwed up into tight knots there was another scream deep inside of him which he wanted to bring up but it wouldnt come just like always it stayed there nestled up inside of him he turned his eyes to the ceiling you think im crazy yeahhahai know what you thinkbut that aint it babyno i know what to doyou hear me i know what to do his body was shaking and there were tears in his eyes you think i dont know the man but i do i know he strong babybut that aint nuthinno babywe can make the man ruin himselfyeah baby they didnt try to interrupt him now they just stood looking at him half in pity half in surprise  whats he on scheid asked watkins he dont take nothing man not that i know of he looks like a friggin junkie sure enough said king through the haze and blur he looked out at king you wanta know baby he said you wanta know how it is you see that box baby you take it and you go and put it somewhere yeah like maybe at yankee stadium or at carnegie hall or maybe baby you just lay it beside a bridge   he threw back his head and laughed with his hands he brushed aside the invisible haze before his eyes and you let yourself get caught baby yeah you lettum know that they gottuh crazy nigger runnin around loose and you know whatyou know what   he stopped again and balanced himself on the folded chair what asked scheid he laughed again mr charlie gets scared baby yeah he gets scared and pretty soon he lockin up black men like flies yeah and after that baby he start shootin black men and maybe hell build some ovens and dump us in em he laughed louder than before his whole body trembled a sob came to his throat and stayed there we make the man he rasped commit his damn genocide before the whole world we make him kill black men babynot one by one but by the hundreds yeah baby we make him wallow in our goddam blood and thats how the manll destroy himself he threw back his head and for five minutes he filled the air with the mixed sound of laughter and crying king nudged scheid get the box and lets make it man this bastards gone scheid lunged for the box but alexander had seen him moving toward it with an animallike scream which stopped the others in their tracks he pushed scheid away scheid already off balance toppled back over one of the folding chairs alexander kicked at scheid and in the same motion snatched up the box they halted in their tracks he laughed again the pain had gone now and his eyes were clear one step baby he threatened one step no one moved no one said anything im going to the bridge baby the brooklyn bridge the famous one comon with me baby there was silence they stood watching him nobody goin they stared menacingly at him all right baby he said and holding the big box tightly under his arm he rushed through the door the train reached the brooklyn bridge station he got off up on the surface he breathed in the salty air he began to walk toward the bridge in back of him the tall buildings reached up to the sky like bars running from earth to heaven and in front of him the bridge lay long and sprawling like some gigantic pathway to another world on the bridge clutching tightly to the box he walked quickly his tennis shoes making harsh ominous sounds in the stillness a vagrant walked over to him he gave the man his last dollar a negro man and a white woman walked by arm in arm he smiled at them they looked at him sheepishly and walked on far in the distance stood the statue of liberty its torch lighting up the already bright sky he turned away from the statue and walked over to the beam in the center of the bridge carefully he laid the box against the beam and pulled the long fuse out from its bottom a police car cruised slowly by he pressed himself against the beam until the car had passed he fixed the box securely and started to walk away pulling the fuse with him it wouldnt be long now no the bridge would go up in smoke right with the eyes of the lady looking on the police car had turned and was now coming back across the bridge in the lane nearest him he didnt see it he had taken out his cigarette lighter and turned once again to look at the statue there were tears in his eyes soon it would be over yes after the explosion he would go down to the police station and turn himself in he would tell them why he had done it too he already knew what he would say between me and your country there is a vendetta yes it has always been that way and it always will and i know now that there cant be any compromise no the compromise would have to be with human beings this level you have secured for yourself but i no longer want to compromise no i want to destroy you yes to tear down your world rung by rung pillar by pillar yes this is what i want he lit the fuse and watched as the flame begin to travel its length then he saw the policemen they had slid out of the car and were advancing toward him halt the voice rang out he began to run down the narrow walkway a shot tore into the wooden plank near his feet he ran faster another car had come up now directly facing him the men slid out before the car rolled to a stop the two policemen stood before him with guns poised aimed at his belly one of the men was a big brown negro the other husky and white alexander threw up his hands and screamed the first bullet tore a large hole in his stomach the second ripped away a piece of his private from behind a bullet ploughed into his skull back and front the bullets assaulted his body until at last he fell in a bloody dismembered heap to the platform he kicked his legs once in the air and shook his head then he lay still the flame still made its way to the box the other policemen had come up with mine sweepers and other devices but it was too late the fuse had burnt its way to the sticks the men began to run the police who had remained in the two cars whipped the cars around quickly and began to speed away a short distance from the bridge they stopped and turned to look back mustve been a dud said one of the policemen yeah answered another looking away sheepishly james king slid from one of the cars he had his monogrammed brief case under his arm that was one crazy spook he whispered to a negro policeman the policeman spat on the ground and walked away the derelict came back across the bridge he looked at the body lying still motionless shook his head and walked on finally the other policeman came back and covered the body with a clean white sheet

the september issue of y rip £ negro digest fea i s tured a most perceptive and p rovocative article by miss abbey lincoln which asked the question who will revere the black woman i am constrained to answer that nobody will revere the black womanuntil she begins to respect herself miss lincoln made reference to the propensity of most americans to glorify all that is white and to deride the hopes the aspirations and the natural appearance of black americans this attitude is of course a part of the legacy othe institution of human slavery as it was practiced and experienced on the north american continent the slave was a chattel an item of commerce a thing stripped of rights denied humanity he was bred and used as a beast with little or no reference to the precepts of morality or human dignity the north american christian attempted to justify such treatment of other children of god by simply denying the common humanity of blacks and whites blacks were to « be treated as animals because blacks were animals placed on earth for the use and convenience of the real humans the whites our blackness was to be a sign of inferiority a sign of shame it followed then that the closer one came to shedding ones heritage of negritude the closer one came to being human to be slavishly imitative of everything white was to be on the path to quasihuman status it is tragic that this conviction of black inferiority not only was but is the dominant american racial feeling not just of whites but among blacks as well and this returns us to the question of respect for negro women the bitter fact is that perhaps a majority of black women would resent even being called black too often the black woman seeks acceptance and emotional security by imitating all of the downright vulgar traits of the most insipid and superficial of white american females what makes so many black women believe that cheap and glossy little cindy lou is the epitome of femininity miss lincoln makes mention of the compulsive frying of black womens hair by other black womentheir refusal to accept the fact that black women are most beautiful when they proudly acknowledge their negritude and quit trying to be what they will never succeed in being and ought not to want to be anyway miss lincoln wrote of skinbleaching sessions and other means of self and groupdegradation one would have more reason to evere black womanhood if more black women could surmount their selfhatred long enough to realize that quite a few of us black men are not at all repelled by broad facial features or broad behinds or countenances which are black and shiny for when the black woman reveres so highly the straightening comb she betrays to blacks and whites male and female alike her own lack of selfesteem and her lack of esteem for black males as well it is difficult to conjure up much respect for such a forlorn creature who does not even respect herself and it is irrelevant that so many white american girls are also vulgar and shallow whites can be our persecutors but we can only be betrayed on this issue of our own standards by other blacks it is galling and senseless that partially emancipated slaves persist intheir eager selfenslavement to all of the frivolities which their former masters can dream up it seems that this is just another sad instance of our glad acceptance of the least attractive items that white america has to offer it is certainly depressingly instructive to reflect on the sizeable amount of rent and food money which is being spent the wigs for the black ghettos some may object that i am unduly critical of black women for accepting the myth of white superiorityblack inferiority which a large majority of americans black and white including most negro males also believe in and suffer from but our women are the repositories and the exemplars of our standards of beauty and so long as our standards of beauty reject all that is natural about ourselves and accept the most artificial of white values we will not rate in our own estimation that equality which we demand of our society those of us who earnestly desire a just a stable and a peaceful resolution of the present menacing third chapter in the unfolding american dilemma are aware that the new society which we must build cannot be based upon superficial good feeling overlaying outmoded concepts of group or selfhate and the first step in attaining the status which our humanity deserves is our own acceptance of ourselves not as black imitation whiteys but as our own black selves unashamed of our birthright of dusk and shadow for who will revere any of us if we do not even respect ourselves
