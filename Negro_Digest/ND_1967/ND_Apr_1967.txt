recently in new  york a friend of mine £ handed me an adveri tisement for a poetry reading a card which declared in bold letters black magic black art will topple the citadel of white racist america he smirked as i looked at the card and told me that art wasnt gonna do sh my friend is one of those who believe we black artists should beat our saxophones and typewriters into spears and daggers and each pick out a white pelt and be recorded in history as the black assassin saints which isnt what stokely means by black_power but getting back to the card my buddy had picked the wrong time to try to rile me into an argument on the relevance of art one the new york critical establishment had just hung my play out for targetpractice two in this same day i had seen two brilliant black poetplaywrights of two widely separated generations both of whom were struggling through new york like crippled lizards so rather than going a few verbal rounds with him i told my friend something vulgar and sat down he respected my mood and just shutup and let charlie parker talk well we sat there with bird playing and me wishing for my wifeshe was here on campus or maybe a whole harem or some religion i could believe in or something and i kept looking at this card black art will destroy white racist america i thought about the work of the two writers i had seen earlier of men like richard wright james baldwin and ralph ellison and there was charlie parker on the boxa black man with his art was all that flowing convoluted beauty charlie was pushing considered black magic too would it topple white racist america i remembered a white guy dave lets say in detroit telling me that when he started listening to parker clifford brown and others he knew he couldnt keep on being scared of black cats and in his words protecting myself with the stereotypes so he started making the jazzsets and introduced himself to some black people i think he even eventually went south with one of the rights groups so when charlie led dave to shake hands with blackfolks something had toppled right some preconceptions and stereotypes certainly dave had at least stepped toward that frenetic frightening darkness from which all that music was being shaped good but supposeand it occurred to me because he had all the makingsdave turned out to be one of those quixotelone rangercomplexed ones who couldnt stand reprimands and commands from the supposed sanchoes and tontoes who were now asserting themselves and their own directions and so found it easier to protest for the vietnamese who would not try to regulate methods of positions in the protest one of those totally committed as long as the means and ends fit the terms of their own vision of things but completely unable to understand it when a malcolm_x or stokely c tells them that their physical psychological image goes counter to the needed impact on ripped and selfdoubting black minds that at best he can be a silent partner plotting with black men around conference tables but having his truerealwork to do alone in places like cicero illinois and hillbilly country southern america where at least he can order a cup of coffee and begin to talk to people before trouble starts can even move in and start a club or something suppose dave was one of those who would rather try to protest across oceans than have black men point directions for him still good charlie still had helped topple something within davebroken the godisalwayson ourside idea inspired the step that led to protest yeh still a score for black art black magic if you will i intended to run that point down to my friend but i stopped myself as i anticipated a possible and very disturbing reaction of his there is a bitter line in my play fightin or fussin beggin or cussin you always gotta go through chuck and here immediately i had jumped to that side of the fence to prove a point to establish validity unconsciously automatically damn its enough to make you go vomiting through the house breaking all the mirrors now it is white racist america which must be toppled destroyed the one which exploits race and class denies the truth of mans human sameness to all men not that ideal racialrainbow that now and again incredibly peeps through and has set forth ideas and methods to better mans people to people relationships but that greenbacked red white and bluebellied snake thats the one that has to go now it sits heaviest on the heads of black men and to speak of the black artists power to topple it is to get into the whole idea of black mens selfassertion of black men going and doing for themselves if i were going to say something i had to talk first of what black mens art did to and for black men what it made them feel and want to assert i had to get to  why the two of us were sitting there listening to bird as though the room were suddenly a mosque and this music was the chant of the true believers i dont know about my friend ray but when i first heard charlie it was like    well let me put it just like it was like all boys i depended on the things i saw and heard around me for selfclarification for reaffirmations of my urges and longings intuitions and impulses to give me some idea of my way of being so i went along fingerpopping shaking my hips doing the chicken getting some little mamas skirt dirty as we rubbed bellies against the wall to one of those syrupy beats you know and in that detroit hasting street environment everything was about like that kind of music in that register with that kind of focuspoint bluesy and groovy you know i dug it it was cool but always i had this frustrated intuitive vibration this sense of never really hearing or seeing anything truly indicative of all that was me or nearly all that footpatting shoulderdipping pelvicevoluting groove was all right but  needed some more image some further higher points of selfreflection then i stumbled onto what charlie parker bud powell and others were doing and lo affirmations affirmations affirmations those quick changing rhythms that involved lyricism the shifting harmonies the speakins not only in two or three shouted words but in long flowing complex sentences how can i tell you about the sudden possibilities this music brought to me the ceiling lifted and out went my sense of freakishness here was what i could not get from white movies no matter how good they were here was that intangible difference in the way ernie wagner moved up the basketball court for northeastern high and the way karl kawalski came down for denby high in what seemed so strange and exotic to othersand so real and natural to mein this music was something of the reason why i could hardly get a new hat out of the store before i had to break it down and put that particular pointedjitterbug if you mustcrease in it you see that hat had to start right away looking like where it had to live and whom it had to suit not some designer in some factory yes affirmations and possibilities charlie told me by the particular points and creases that he put to old standards like in the sill of the night that i could wear my felt crown to the white house and not have to stumble all over myself trying to act and sound like i was a fourthgeneration graduate from harvard he crystallized a nuance of being that was very necessary to me i needed that crease in my hat he along with others updated the sound of things added intellect to sensuality sped up the beat so that the footpatting was still there but now it was like the way you stomp out a cigarette when youve got to clear your mouth because youve got something to say and life is racing and most importantly i say once more that this music was one of the things that convinced me that i could be as black as night and hastings street and still be whatever in life i wanted if only i did it well enough they might not play my music on the radio and try to make a joke out of me but someone somewhere would react if i did it well affirmations and inspiration that is what the black artist must mean to the black man speaking of the qualities of himself and his livingplace as truthfully and artistically as he can with no ones standards or acceptance in mind but his own the artist strikes empathy and identification there is the reaction of acknowledgement than the assertion of what has been acknowledged and the changing and topplingfirst inner with the body personal then outward through the bodies social political etcis on its way and if you think that all this sounds very romantic you are right in any revolution or evolutionif youd ratherthere must be the romantic art the wishes and longings must be symbolized and projected the pains and transgressions must be fixed in hated pictures jazzso far the blackest of the artsis probably the most romantic music since brother beethoven gave up the ghost and that is as it should be there is a peculiarly ironic reason for jazz americas most indigenous and significant contribution to art being basically and mainly the work of black men and for jazzmen being far ahead of all other black artists in true selfexpression and assertion that reason is that only in music were our slave forefathers allowed to retain and nurture anything of africa of blackness you see me being white and the slavemaster and all  aint about to let you talk in no old tribal language naw no tellin what you might be gettin those black heads together on when l cant understand you so no storytelling no passing down traditions and all that youll learn this here language and the right stories outta this goodbook and the lies i got to tell you and enforce upon you sos i can sleep at night thats all and none of that foolin roun with your hands either you might call it sculpturing and painting but it looks like voodoo signs to me you gonna paint paint christ like michelangelo and them did you gonna make figures out of wood and stone then put some clothes on em and make em look more like me than they do sos   can trust em but boy that rhythm you all got with them drums a nd oh those deep soulful voices  want to go sing outside the bighouse and out in the fields while youre workingkeeps your mind occupied and it makes everything sound and look and feel so peaceful yes that is why the jazzman is the furthest along in selfassertion and unrestrained unaccommodating selfexpression because the slavemaster understood the danger in education but had never gotten to socrates warning about the songmakers so since music is the most abstract least concrete or plastic of the arts the jazzmaker never had to waste precious time proving how well he knew the language and forms of western man but went right ahead and bent that european scale to fit his own impulses had jazzmen been using words or readily definable images like our writers and painters then they too would be just now emerging in their true colors would have been squelched by editors publishers and critics for john coltrane is a man who through his saxophone before your eyes and ears completely annihilates every single western influence and longs and strains so totally so desperately for the asianafrican nuance that soon he is actually there in his playingas a man who calls on his gods and lo they appear this is the same thing as the afrohaircuts and clothes worn by people who have never been further east than bostona rejection and a yearning it may seem all a ridiculous joke to you but it is no less an effective and important joke than the one which was once recorded as law in this country that two indians and one africanor viceversa im not sureconstituted legally one human being yeh funny huh now getting back to the music there is another saxophonist named pharoah saunders who plays horrible lynchscenes with barking dogs and all coming out of his horn and thento my strange mind at leastgoes into the massacre of the resultant retaliation with the bleeding screams of men women and children when he finishes you dont know whether to applaud or go ask for an aspirin and a boatticket to somewhere else but it is truth as he has witnessed and visualizes it it is an artful projection there are other men like sonny rollins and ornette coleman who play so starkly freely personal that one knows that somehow they have felt nearly all the stimuli and hangups of this place and this time have gone into themselves somewhere and found new scales new harmoniesa new religion in fact now isnt that frighteningly interesting and what would it sound like in words appear as in definite symbols and images would it affect the selectiveservice draft do you think make for further boycotts and rejections with verbal jazzmen like leroi jones adding and explaining dimensions what will this yearning for the destruction of things western and the exulting of things eastern and this other personal insulation come to mean when it has all hit earth and settled i honestly do not know i only know that at least psychically there will be changes good changes it is as i eventually answered my friend black art can do a lot to topple white racist america if it is black enough what do i mean by black enough well let me try to give some examples of what i mean by black art or more specifically black literature i mean when a black writer really works inside that yearold sister sadie who has been a rock of her church for some thirty years and finds that she is a black nun loving and giving herself to herherjesus with a passion and a need that catholics only dream guiltily about that there are such things in that africanbaptist dance she does when the spirit hits her that are hardly imaginable to most people i mean when a writer looks into one of those housing projects and sees anna karenina or a madame bovarywith a different hue tone and manner of courseand just when the worldreader is panting for her and hoping that her plans work out the writer drops in the bigoted white cop of this black ghetto setting like a filthy stinkbomb and splatters the lovestory all to hell with a quick triggerfinger thats more like what blackness in this country is like life being stopped because its covering its skin is taboo i mean putting john henry on stage with his pride and hammers and wife family neighbors and have him go roaring against automation and the enslavement of the human spirit cussing fighting loving and hating all the way coming down hard on anybody and anything standing against his simple truth aw a man aint nothin but a man i mean a writer examining that crude but almost reflexive phrase the big mf and seeing in it matriarch feeding oedipus complex coming out of the emasculation of the black male and father image and the historic rape of the black woman and finding the way to explode that phrase into full meaning and consciousness i mean a writer sitting the late and great malcolm_x down with us and letting us hear the tobes and nottobes of a more modern and unique hamlet i mean seeing on paper how a black ghetto organizes politically and otherwise against the pressures of government police landlords and mafia the fictionist is free to project neverbeforeseen times places and circumstances hes the one whos supposed to be sitting up all night taking on and raking over the sins of this world is he not i mean a way of literarily stylizing that little bouncedip in the walks those creases and points in those hats i mean a literature knowing that since it deals with human beings the universals will fall no matter what if the readers lap is open so concerning itself with colloquials the little shades and nuances that come out of unique lifeexperiences and environmental influences a literature that asserts rather than reacts states rather than explains that is what i mean by black literature and when this literatureas did irish russian french and earlier american literaturefinally comes into being adding its weight to all the other force factors in the air there will be a change in the consciousness the selfsense of this country this people and something must topple must give way to the changes

my play wedding band is the story of a black woman and a white man south carolinians who in the year  desire to become legally married it was then and m tnc is now against the state law for two such citizens to be joined in matrimony the drama also concerns two black warriors serving in world war i known as the war to end all wars with the assurance that after the battle patriotism would be rewarded with firstclass citizenship it is now three wars later and the promise made is still unkept other characters include three black women struggling in various ways to survive without the protection of their men two white women in conflict with each other and the contradictions of society a poor white salesman comically lost in the confused labyrinth of his own mind and a negro servant who earns a lonely but wellfed existence by deliberately turning away from the problems of progress against this tragicomic background two little girls one white the other colored are deeply impressed by the unfolding of events people tend to ask why write about thatthat usually stands for the possibility of controversy which has a way of stemming from themes on race or interracial conflict when presented in a land which abounds in racist law and racism but no matter how much has been seen and heard about that little of it has come from the american writer of african descent only  of his plays have reached broadway in the last  years only two were made into filmsa raisin in the sun by lorraine hansberry and purlie victorious by ossie davis it seems evident that theatre audiences have not been exposed to a great deal of controversial or any other kinddrama created by the afroamerican playwright sixteen plays over such a period of time constitute a very small percentage of the thousands presented on the big street in the art center of the u s a new york city n y much more work has seen the light of day on the stages of offbroadway and in community theatres improvised in churches libraries and meeting halls these productions have reached only a small section of the public and as a result we hear little if anything about themexcept from those scholars who devote time and energy to researching the subject playwright and guggenheim fellow loften mitchells new book black drama which comes from the press this spring promises to shed more light on a comparatively unexplored subject our dramatists have not had a wider viewing because we as a people have not had the power to decisively determine the quality and quantity of our participation in theater television radio and films which power would enable us to portray life as we see it also those who have the power and the means of production seem at best constrained to move slowly  and to keep pace with the advances or setbacks of the national struggle for human and civil_rights the characters in a play may be made of impressions gathered from old or new incidents conversations disconnected words and sensememories of physical  characteristics and human emotions they are created and constructed of what hurts and what heals slowly built and put in order out of the conflict which comes from the daily search for bread love and a place in the sun the best characters are good and true cowardly and brave miserable and happy filled with the virtues and weaknesses found in ourselves they grow stronger and more insistent in the mind of the writer they cancel each other out until the right story and the right people emerge and blend into one predominant idea or theme the story of wedding band gradually took shape as the result of a reaction to hearing that old chestnut quoted time and time t againthe two freeest things in the country are the black woman and the white man the more it was repeated the more often i wondered what kind of freedom the originator of the remark had m in mind it is a known fact that in cer  tain states in the union the black woman in and out of bondage was free with or without her consent and to the detriment of her children to have her body exploited as unpaid and cheap labor andor illegal sex in these same states the white man was free to use her wrongly for these purposes but not free to offer her or their offspring the protection of his name and property segregationists constantly proclaim that we cannot legislate in order to force citizens toward equal rights and better race relations but they have passed thousands of laws to force us in the opposite direction it seems that such reasoning should have resulted in no race creed or color laws at all which would leave people free to think for themselves after writing a first draft of the play i spent considerable time in libraries researching the racist laws found in the united states it would have been easy to spend a few years or even a lifetime at this endeavor so i had to call a halt and go back to the job of writing anyone interested in the subject will save time by reading the very excellent book titled states laws on race and color compiled and edited by attorney pauli murray published by the womens division of christian service of the methodist church it is interesting to know that after emancipation the state of georgia declared every colored child born before march   shall be the legitimate child of his mother this action clearly prevented the black mother from claiming any inheritance for her children born of a slavemaster father the harm done by such a law was compounded by the attitude of selfdepreciation and selfhatred it sometimes engendered in the black communities most racemixing had taken place under the sanction of the slave institution but in the interest of selfpreservation the penniless black now technically out of bondage was forced to keep quiet concerning his relationship to white families his race was now lightened to various shadings and newly labeled colored on documents rest room doors drinking water fountains and railroad station waiting rooms even the statistics of today very much concerned with counting how many heads are on welfare credit the entire mixed population to the black people we see no calculation as to the number of such persons who represent the disinherited those bilked of any portion of what was rightfully theirs due to the legal exploitation of black women the few whites who wished to acknowledge their mixed families were by law forbidden to do so some passed for colored and were married in the south but upon the death of such a person his relatives were able to disprove the marriage and seize all the worldly goods of any material value even today in this matter we frequently allow ourselves to be placed on the defensive why talk about thatl if we criticized the law theyll think we want to be with them if we criticized segregation at all theyll think were avidly seeking their company it is certainly evident that the black american has had nothing to do with the creation or implementation of such devious legal trickery as racist law but put on the defensive it somehow seems to many of us that a challenge to what has been set up to regiment and regulate our lives places us in danger of being judged by the oppressor and ourselves and found wanting in dignity and integrity under the sanctimonious cover of states rights some citizens have been able to plan the future of others without their participation separate but equal law has had more than a hundred years to further impoverish the black communities wedding band examines womans position in society her situation at this very moment the story is set in  and reveals through the people of that time how few of the wrongs which threaten family unity have been righted in order to deal with the subject a writer must find his way through a maze of confusion and  clear away the warped thinking caused by slavery and its after effects    the acid poisons of selfhatred and contempt caused by the miseducation of the people in order to deal effectively with the problems created by marriage laws it was necessary to make sure that the play not be interpreted as one which advocates the intermarriage of races that kind of treatment would place the work almost in the same camp as the antipeople legislation therefore no character could plead the cause of intermarriage and none suggest the changing of law the other hurdle to overcome was the shadow cast by all the stories that have been told about the mintjulep colonel and his almostwhite sweetheart for my leads i selected a black seamstress and a white baker and projected them into a situation in which there was no premeditated intention of exploitation on either side and only the events that take place in their lives during the crisis of an influenza epidemic were used in shaping the progress of the play also because some of us hope to be assimilated absorbed and digested into the mainstream of american life thus proving that we in and of ourselves are not american life it was necessary for my story to have a black woman who did not seek this kind of solution in her personal act of integration where did such a woman meet a white man on at least an almost equal footing the obvious place to find an unprotected young woman living away from family and friends is in domestic service on the kind of sleepin job which allows a monthly or bimonthly visit home the closest white equal in this case might be an unmarried tradesman operating a oneman business in this way the seamstress and baker were set up to meet and unfold the story the most crucial three days in the relationship take place  years after their first meeting and so the entire action is accomplished during this threeday period the missing factor in the interracial tales usually found in fiction is the black man the colonels sweetheart never seemed to know any men of her own race and those presented as background filler were usually slackkneed objects of pity this caused me to see an admirable black man in the center of the drama one who could supply a counterpoint story with its own importance a man whose every day existence is threatened with the possibility of a life and death struggle after the first or second draft of the script there comes a time when all the earmarks of preachment must be searched out and removed all that has been superimposed by the writer all that the characters deny and refuse to accept anything that smacks of pamphleteering on the subject out come some of your favorite bits and piecesthe idiom of speech never used by those characters who people your work you are taxed to show them as they are beautiful in a way not yet merchandised by madison avenue one day the federal government must declare that no state may carry any law which infringes upon the federal rights of any citizen such action will lift the struggle for human and civil_rights to the position where the people may move forward with the unstinting approval of their government between that time and this we who find ourselves born into this past and present situation will continue to protest in various ways according to our understanding and circumstances those conscious of living in the blight of legalized limitation will continue to be engrossed in the controversy of to be or not to be    free the american of african descent has produced the only new music which came out of the new worldspirituals gospel and jazz i firmly believe that for him the protest play will reach new heights in form and content become ever more finished in craftsmanship and eventually prove to be the most varied and original theatre on the american scene the times dictate the trend we are at a moment in history when the playwright cannot turn away from social drama without abandoning the search for truth
in a conference monday may th in ann arbor david rambeau director of the concepteast theatre was told by university officials that the lilywhite association of producing artists was an artistic ideal mr rambeau met with university vicepresident heyns assistant to the vicepresident miller professor schnitzer executive director of the apa and professor sattler chairman of the speech department when these officials were questioned about other areas of the professional theater program over the past two years these details were revealed in the new play project and the professional fellowship program  scholarships per year no negroes were utilized in the play of the month series one  negro actress in two years when it was pointed out to vicepresident heyns that one negro in two years in all four areas the apa play of the month series new play project and the professional fellowship program indicated reasonable evidence of the absence of equal opportunity mr heyns instructed mr rambeau that the situation could remain so for ten  years and still be no indication of discrimination or unequal opportunity during the discussion mr rambeau attempted to introduce the comments of frederick oneal negro actors leader looks at the record detroit news  recently elected president of actors equity who cited the patterns of discrimination in the theater however none of the university officials would even so much as peruse the editorial to ascertain whether the comments might possibly be applied to the situation at the university of michigan professor schnitzer flatly stated there is no prejudice in the theater when questioned as to whether any negroes had ever been with the apa the university officials stated that that information was not available when queried as to what evidence would indicate discrimination mr rambeau was summarily told by professor schnitzer that he and mr rabb casting director were not prejudiced if there were no negroes in the apa it was merely because none had applied for auditions or that if any had applied none was qualified vicepresident heyns accepted this statement as gospel and indicated that though the university had hired the apa it could not question the segregated casting policy as this would be an infringement on artistic freedom when mr rambeau pointed out to vicepresident heyns that the play of the month series was bringing to the campus segregated shows from broadway and that the university should not buy such productions he was told to go talk to the producers of the shows or produce concrete evidence and not statistics rambeau pointed out that this kind of evidence statistics was the only kind readily available to the outsider and that this is what civil_rights organizations and the president s committee on equal opportunity used in their investigations mr rambeau was asked what made him think these methods possessed any adequacy in this situation when mr rambeau suggested that one way to correct the situation would be to add some qualified negroes to the apa he was called a racist as the meeting wore on it became quite obvious that the university officials would do nothing on their own to correct the situation as they view the entire professional theater program as quite satisfactory still mr rambeau pressed question after question and point after point for nearly two hours in hopes of enlightening the university officials to the discriminatory setup existing in their theater he cited the concepts of cultural exclusion in the professional theater racial casting historical and current discrimination in movies television and the stage de facto segregation in the high school systems that feed the university drama program the selffulfilling prophecy in imprinting on potential negro applicants that they have no opportunity or place in white plays and the social and psychological community repercussions of segregated educational programsall to no avail when continued inquiry about university image educational idealism leadership and community obligation proved redundant mr rambeau concluded that further investigation by other concerned parties would have to be secured on this dissonant note the conference was terminated there exists an ironic postscript worthy of mention at neighboring michigan state university on may  and  was held a symposium on school integration which had two purposes first to focus attention on school segregation issues particularly in the north and west and second to contribute to the solutions of the problems through conversations between social scientists professional educators and local educational policy makers
in obvious consequence of the may  conference on discrimination in the professional theater program at the university of michigan the association of producing artists held a spade day audition in nyc concepteast officials were informed by their new york associates that the apa sent out a casting call to actors agents to which nearly  negro actors and actresses responded to fill a single vacancy as the waiting rooms filled the applicants recognized the blatantly segregated scene and showered apa representatives with derision subsequent to the audition form letters were sent to the unqualified applicants informing them that they had failed to meet apa standards in a stealthy plot to avoid rigorous negotiation of differences the apa failed to inform the concepteast of their decision to open the theater company to token integration officials of concepteast viewed this as another subtle attempt of the power structure to foist a unilateral decision on the negro as to his needs and the limit of his opportunity this endplay by the apa in their new york audition is just another insult to the two years of injury which the negro endured from the universitys lilywhite professional theater program which was termed by its executive director as an artistic ideal in view of this naive maneuver the concepteast set its minimum terms for bringing a reasonable degree of equal opportunity into the university program as follows  employment of six  qualified negro actors for the coming season  a public statement of nonracial casting  awarding of two  of the seven fellowships in the professional fellowship program to negro colleges  that all broadway or offbroadway shows brought to the university in the play of the month series be integrated  that this years new play in the new play project be authored by a negro concepteast termed its request reasonable in view of the two years of public and private bigotry during the residence at the university of the apa if these minimum requests are met the apa can maintain its private prejudices behind a mask of liberal equal opportunity as behavior rather than attitude is crucial to the concepteast in the face of obtrusive hypocrisy as evidenced by the situation in the universitys professional theater program one can easily understand the invectiveridden nature of plays authored by negroes who evaluate their american dream james baldwins blues for mr charlie and leroi jones dutchman belch the grim need for recognition in the us the concepteast has had its broiled eyes focused on the apa for two solid years watching the scene develop while silently singing the blues now its time for blues for mr charlie 
on august   david rambeau director of the concepteast theatre filed a complaint with the michigan civil_rights commission charging the university of michigan and the association of producing artists with complicity in discriminatory practices in employment and education in the operation of their professional theater program on september   milton brown field representative of the mcrc met with university attorneys university vicepresident heyns assistant to the vice president miller and executive director of the apa schnitzer in this preliminary investigation data was sought on the alleged discriminatory practices prior to the initiation of a formal suit because of the interstate nature of the case concepteast theatre officials have asked the actors equity association and the new york state commission for human rights to investigate the new york operations of the association of producing artists and submit advisory opinions when questioned about the apa mr rambeau stated this acting company might as well have come from mississippi for all the equ opportunity it is supposed to have its hiring practices are not unlike those of the apprentice trades and everybody knows that situation besides michigan has enough problems without importing some of new yorks if the apa is characteristic of the hiring policies in new york theres little wonder that there are riots in harlem and brooklyn during a continued discussion of the complaint mr rambeaus views were enlarged and detailed the apa and the university of michigan constitute just one phase of a total system of economic and educational discrimination existing in the united states against the negro if there is any initial problem in prosecuting the complaint it will be in identifying their the university and apa specific roles and discriminatory actions in the broad pattern of racial prejudice this pattern of economic discrimination is recurrent in every area of the dramatic arts films television radio and the legitimate stage as educational discrimination is evidenced by de facto segregation in the schools elementary and high schools overcrowded classes slanted texts and biased school administrators the end results are theatre companies like the apa and freshman classes at the university of michigan wherein  negroes were found enrolled in the class of over  then we witness frantic corrective measures apas spade day audition in new york this summer and token hiring of a negro to sit by the door so that if and when investigators come they can trot out their kept nigger and say look look oh no were liberal and legal for government contracts weve got one  of them and corrective measures like the universitys scholarships for the culturally deprived approximately  scholarships so that now the freshman class will have slightly less than three per cent negro enrollment rather than slightly less than one per cent this paltry progress is designed to be balm for the white educated liberals conscience his egoistic realization of noblesse oblige and christian charity this paltry progress is designed to placate black moderates and castrate black militants all such stopgap measures are ultimately unsatisfactory because the bigoted immoral premises on which they are based are ultimately untenable for both the victim and the oppressor we now witness the internationally esteemed university of michigan its attorneys and vice presidents defending a corrupt situation the professional theatre program in a corrupt system economic and educational strangulation based on corrupt values racial discrimination
perhaps the time has p y come to assess those £ characteristics which skcwssi make the new york shakespeare festival an important american classical theatre even though the festival has achieved recognition primarily on artistic grounds there are nevertheless certain problems inherent in the interracial structure of the company which take on importance beyond the basic consideration of professional abilities our attention in this article will be directed towards these social problems which have developed from the racial composition of the festival organization because of its role as the popular theatre for everyone the festival has a critical responsibility to the multiracial community which supports its program this obligation has been fulfilled only within recent years through a balanced company representing the various ethnic groups present in new york city joseph papp the festival producer seems to be making an honest effort in this direction he stated in an interview on april   a major objective of the festival  we would like to have a company that is representative of all the various facets of the population of new york city all the various minorities and we want this not for sociological reasons but for artistic reasons in comparison to other repertory companies such as the arena theatre in washington d c the lincoln center repertory company in new york city and the american conservatory theatre in san francisco the attempt is impressive a closer look at the problems created by the integrated aspects of the company is perhaps best observed through an analysis of coriolanus as directed by gladys vaughan  in  this particular play dramatizes the inner struggles of a roman aristocrat caius marcius coriolanus a man unable to overcome the inadequacies of his moral and ethnical principles through his actions we are able to see the larger conflicts existing between peasant and aristocrat in this legendary history of romes emergence as a world power this is one of shakespeares most difficult plays and is subject to a great number of interpretations mrs vaughan saw many parallels between this classic play and our society and felt that the mob would be more meaningful to this period if the cast were mixed the concluding lines in the program notes of the production elaborate upon this viewpoint since the future of the entire human race is now vulnerable to that moment of decision of the man in power a study of those who seek power is more pertinent than ever before the transposition of dramatic theme to a contemporary context introduced certain emotional tensions which reflected the present struggle of negroes for firstclass citizenship that which resulted on stage was more of a civil_rights demonstration than a play some anachronism is of course part of the contemporary form but even then it must be controlled in order not to distort the authors intentions the effects of such a narrow interpretation was obviously not foreseen there is a social comment implied in the theme of the play and the pattern of the action however it is not the responsibility of a director or actor to impose a preconceived idea upon a play or an audience a spectator can also limit and destroy an art experience by imposing predetermined expectations and terms of social reference upon a play and upon performers who exist momentarily within the world of the play one should be forced to think and draw his own conclusions through the artistic power of the drama rather than from predetermined valuejudgment we expect the playwright to provide us with experience which is more dynamic more objective and more coherent than the contradictions present in actual experience by the same token it is the responsibility of the artist to interpret this ordered experience by trying to find the authors intention and to transmit the same meaning to an audience without distortionthe dramatic focus and aesthetic quality of this particular production was vague and unclear in the first place the performance was too long additional editing of the script would have eliminated much that was unnecessary to the progression of the plot one critic remarked that the director had seen fit to put so many members of equity to work that the stage gets cluttered and the battle scenes look more like street rumbles than actual war it was obvious that the continual movement of citizens running on and off stage shouting waving flags and scrambling about resulted in action that was often unintentionally comical there were moments however when the crowd was a determined and suffering mob with the exception of jane white who played volumnia and james earl jones as the tribune junius brutus the remaining negro actors made up the majority of the tattered dirty mob john simon in his usual blunt manner observed with mrs vaughans roman citizenry about fourfifths negro rome became clearly the capital of abyssinia the few whites presumably accountable for as missionaries the trouble with this sort of thing is that it cannot help setting off wrong responses one such response occurred when the segregationist coriolanus mounted the platform and told the roman peasants i banish you 
the middleclass white audience in the delacorte theatre applauded it was obvious that they sided with the white element in what appeared to be a modern civilrights fight there was a great deal of action on the stage but it had little to do with an objective study of a democratic society in which neither side is totally right or completely wrong the director informed this writer that her choice of cast depended primarily upon the talents of the actors and the demands of the roles she further attempted to justify the use of so many negroes by stating this could have been historically accurate even in roman days    so it wasnt historically inaccurate to cast negroes and we had several other ethnic groups represented this idea perhaps deserves praise from a social viewpoint but it did not serve the play as written what the audience observed was a group of actors in many situations which paralleled rather than expressed the play also the approach of a few actors in their roles merely emphasized the fact that they were negro their colloquial patterns of speech physical movements and facial gestures leads one to feel that they either lacked understanding of or disregard for the characters that were portrayed the arrangement of white to negro performers brought a different nuance to the script and quite possibly eliminated the play as it was originally conceived when various dramatic themes are interpreted to emphasize certain problems in american society especially with the addition of nonwhite cast membersthe plays take on an immediate importance dr esther jackson former director of education of the new york shakespeare festival may have discovered the solution to this serious problem which exists not only within the festival organization but within the american theatre at large i think the development of a multiracial ethic and a multiracial aesthetic on the stage are dependent upon helping artiststhat is the producers and directorsto free themselves subconsciously perhaps of very deep prejudices which make it necessary for them to use negro players in nonartistic ways no inference is being made that this is the basis of the problem as observed in coriolanus in this instance the director had some difficulty in maintaining the dominant idea among acting staging and designinghallmarks of a skilled director norman nadel felt that dramatic integration was lacking the integration so vital is the intimate relationship of one role to another and all to the play  gladys vaughan accepted the risk of failure by approaching the text of legendary history from a contemporary viewpoint certainly the same risk is present in a conventional production if the results are dull and unimaginative whether she consciously considered coriolanus as a medium of social propaganda or only happened upon this idea is not the primary reason that her production was not completely successful there appeared to have been no coherent realization of theme reflected through the particular shape of the play and the artistic use of nonwhite actors within the play the emphasis of production focused on visual elements such as a wellmounted stage sumptuous costumes physically attractive actors exciting and realistic sound effects and movement patterns of choreographic dimension in the last analysis theatre is either good or bad it either succeeds in creating a meaningful experience or it fails in spite of the social ideas practiced by an individual or an organization since coriolanus is based on legendary history it is not totally symbolic the idea that integrated casting may possibly work better in plays that are nonovertly historical symbolic or poetic should be considered by mrs vaughan it could be that this play was a bad choice or perhaps less sophistication is necessary to recognize the universality of the human condition the problems that face the actors in the festival company are in many ways typical of those faced by the average american actor without a tradition of discipline and training in classical styles of acting the quality of production cannot help but be inferior in excellence one major cause is the absence of a pattern of continuity which a strong training program will provide not only for the actors but for the artistic and technical staff as well although casting procedures have been unbiased they nonetheless reflect gross indiscrimination a quantitative approach has resulted in a company which employs many unqualified actors from both races it is significant perhaps that the festival often prefers to use lightskinned negroes like frank silvera jane white or ellen holly in major roles there have been exceptions like robert hooks james earl jones and roscoe lee browne however the limitation of certain types of negroes to a variety of nonheroic lead roles has been naive in spite of the preceding criticism the festival has made a unique contribution to the american theatre its innovating spirit and earnestness in taking classical drama presenting it with some style and taste and yet making it practical enough to be enjoyed by a large crosssection of people from all levels of society is significant also the festival directors have shown a large degree of integrity in an effort to measure up to high artistic goals which they have set for themselves and for the people of new york city in the midst of bureaucratic disinterest these at tempts are praiseworthy even though theory and practice are not completely harmonious at this time during the last few years the festival has earnestly worked towards integrated theatre in keeping with the peculiar makeup of our society this type of theatre offers the healthiest and most rewarding type of art experience to the greatest number of people but if the vitality and creativity of the negro actor is going to be reduced through integrated theatre then an allnegro theatre would probably be better actually what is needed for the total acceptance of a multiracial aesthetic is the broad exposure of society to integrated art activities the negro artist in many instances has much to offer the american theatre and an interracial theatre is perhaps where his greater contribution will be made
theater for social welfare has replaced theatres old image an image of pastime activity the federal government is subsidizing many of the countrys repertory theaters however no black theaters and the present funded repertory theaters are not involving talents from the black communities there should be an involvement of the black communities in this new awareness of the power of the theaters because the social condition of this country is directly related to conditions in the black communities to say that barefoot in the park and hello dolly represent theater is in a sense like saying black communities do not exist it is a paradox to expect that nonexistent community to come downtown to broadway or to the tyrone guthrie theatre in minneapolis and pay to support what has no relation at all to what the members of that community know as this society item witness the odd couple any wednesday l do i do mame
art for profit or a play by jean kerr has never been a password from black talents they are not that far removed from the lifeline but it is not the black talents who are funded or even encouraged to be a part of the federally supported repertory theaters the repertory companies are encouraged by the boards of education and the poverty programs to perform in the school systems and b fore the culturally deprived yet the plays and the artist are far removed from the lifeline of the black communities in new york and california there are cultural programs operating under the antipoverty program these drama and dance companies could easily operate in conjunction with the board of education to bring socially meaningful art to schools in the immediate area it seems to me that a theater for the social welfare of a community should provide opportunities for talented blacks in the communities to develop as artists within a professional setting at the same time this could demonstrate the need for communitybased repertory both talent and theater would be making a collective contribution to the community this is not happening the artists who are supported create from a safe distance therefore their work is synthetic its description of this society its attempt to make order out of chaos has no lasting value how can an  artist depict a black art say of watts mississippi or harlem when that artist is living comfortably in westport or hollywood item the federal government under title  and title  is supporting stuart vaughns new orleans repertory theatre no negroes are involvedneither in background or foreground it has been proven that a black audience does exist for a socially meaningful theater blacks came out to support baldwins blues for mister charlie and amen corner they supported hansberrys a raisin in the sun leroi jones black arts repertory and his oneact plays the toilet the slave and dutchman now they are flocking to douglas turner wards happy ending and day of absence these plays could easily belong to a black federally supported repertory theater in a black community for integration a black hamlet genets the blacks or dubermans in white america otherwise black talent will continue to wait for white approval on projects that are watered rewritten andor rejected labeled protest oppressed people and classes have historically channeled their images and passions to the stage beaumarchais marriage of figaro kindled social fires that helped flame the french revolution gorkys the lower depths in  dramatized the oppression of russias peasants clifford odets during the thirties stung the social conscience with his prolabor play waiting for lefty item art must deal with the time my students here at mobilization for youth were so moved by waiting for lefty that they adapted it from the original cab strike to a rent strike on new yorks lower east side something meaningful for them there must be some reason for not showing the young and the deprived what the theater is capable of doing could it be fear there must be a change in the identity of those who bring art into the black communities if blacks are to have quality education and participation in the various art forms including theater even now the lincoln center repertory company is taking live theater into the new york school system and to the culturally deprived while it is effective in the schools which are basically middle class it is less effective in the schools say in harlem and bedford stuyvesant this is because whites believe that blacks are still trying to assimilate it is the exact reverse on the ascendant now is a tremendous pride in being black whites ignorance of this is causing ineffectual education and of course the promotion of subject matter that is boring to the children in these areas in the theater of the sixties black consciousness has reached new levels of concentration and intensity a metaphysical play by beckett with negro and puerto rican performers would be more effective than shakespeare with an allwhite cast this is due to an immediate identification with the visual image of the present item in harlem roger furman operating with oeo office of economic opportunity funds as a part of haryou has consistently exhibited fine theatre his productions with the young vital performer would be an inspiration for every junior high school student in the ghetto after reading the reports from ford foundation in the s and the rockefeller foundation one can hardly find reasons for them not dumping grants into these socially deprived communities the foundations state their policies which do not hold generally for black communities example the foundation should exercise discrimination and selectivity and give its funds largely for significant activity not likely to be supported by others they should seek out sustain and amplify excellence and where necessary create new centers of excellence they should help to increase the vigor of private institutions and private initiative in areas of critical concern to society there are some  regional theaters in the united states supported by foundations and now the federal government under the national endowment of the arts and titles  and  under the elementary and secondary education act these theaters do not include blacks on staff as designers directors writers or technicians black actors are booked in as spear carriers in the old classics nothing is realistic in these regional theaters for the black artist nothing is realistic for black audiences now the federal government is helping to support this discriminating system it started in the middle fifties after the mccarthy senate investigations pop art emerged because the artist could say it meant a when it really meant b or vice versa art as well as the theater went abstract for safetyhappenings theatre of the absurd etc it became a lie artists knew this the public knew it it could not last black artists emerged from the chaos because they had less to lose white america went deeper into it by trying to escape via musicals comedies british angry young men and because the country was afraid it laughed and danced trying to forget the lie the social welfare of this country is at stake white america trying to escape from the inner city to the suburb is synonymous to whites trying to escape from what we all know can exist order in the chaos under all that singing and dancing on broadway there is a  lifeline vietnam mississippi harlem watts malcolm_x theater is no longer a pastime it is serious business it can be dangerous and yet we know that black communities must have their own art centers because white values are not black values in the thirties when roosevelts workmans progress administration wpa supported the theater blacks were involved because the theater put money in circulation blacks didnt control it as many believe it was on the whole meaningful even though in the eyes of roosevelts administration it was pastime activity high class theater for social welfare was disguised as pastime activity until the establishment witnessed performances of the cradle will rock it cant happen here one third of the nation but now during the sixties theater for pastime activity cannot be disguised as theater for social welfare when we read that stuart vaughns new orleans repertory theater is doing charleys aunt we chuckle and say whitey is doing it again two things happen when a play about blacks is presented for whites anytime a play is presented on broadway or offbroadway it is presented for whites  they stay away because they are not interested in the least in what blacks are saying because most of the time blacks are saying some truths about the conditions in this country or  whites are so conditioned by musicals and comedies and historical museum pieces that they are not prepared to witness anything new for example consider the recent play whos got his own by ronald milner at the american place theatre harold clurman theater critic for the nation departed after act i and did not review the play now i must point out here that whos got his own is a black play american place theatre is a white theaterwith a good reputation its subscription audience is  per cent white and through studies it has been proven that subscription audiences are middle class harold qurman is a critic for a national magazine he is as middle class as the audience for that play his dismissal of whos got his own reflects the feelings of that audience milner received a firstclass production of his play and a secondclass audience to approve its worth the wirter was caught in the paradoxical situation with which most black artists in this country are eventually faced to be an american artist and at the same time to be a negro to please the audience the author and the theater would have had to lie about the black mans condition in this country the artists function is to interpret life says john o killens i see him as a hunter in the jungle with civilization being the jungle his prey is truth socially meaningful theater must be truthful to the happenings of our time

the fst literature workshop there is one clear favorite the autobiography of malcolm_x the company receives a registered letter it is from a spokesman for the housing authority of new orleans the spokesman takes exception to the essay on the desire project in our poetry show which had been filmed in june  for national presentation by cbstv our piece strikingly delivered by actress denise nicholas had told of lack of facilities for black people in the desire project it warned that if corrective action was not taken by the city or if black people in desire did not organize to force corrective action then new orleans could expect the same rioting which was exploding in other cities the tv show was filmed in our theater in desirea filmed discussion followed our audience the folk of the area heatedly discussed the whys and wherefores of their community the letter from the housing authority termed our presentation   calculated to engender racial disharmony it went on to state if there were evidence of wilful neglect of chronic mistreatment of callousness in any other form on the part of the authority leading to the conclusion that the thousands of residents of the desire project are in effect abandoned in spite of all reasonable efforts to arouse the authority to a full sense of responsibility then and only then could we look without too much suspicion and distrust upon what we must consider an infamous indictment the letter suggested a meeting between the fst board of directors and the housing authority naming time and place we were to be requested to ask that the tv show be canceled the fst board which is very small and includes several company members declined to meet with the housing authority as far as we were concerned there was nothing to negotiate

when the company appeared in bogalusa the black community was in the midst of a massive fight for its rightsdemonstrators were ubiquitous violence was in the air there were scores of visiting workers from core and other organizations in  the company had played to an overflow audience it seemed as if the entire black community came the bogalusa chief of police had brought his men to observe outside the union hall the company had entered and left bogalusa under armed escort by the deacons for defense now all the visiting rights workers have retired to their own bags the only remaining workers are the bogalusa voters league led by robert hicks and a z young since bogalusa is only  miles from new orleans we had decided to take several workshop kids to the show dick schechner tulane drama review editor who had been influential in the move of fst to new orleans in  drove another car it was very dull we shot pool in the afternoon the summer was coming to an end without the kind of harassing arrests and incipient violence that accompanied the  tour after the show we who were returning to new orleans the company was remaining in bogalusa to play the next night requested deacon escort for a few miles as a precautionary routine we were asked to wait for the escort in a local cafe after about an hour the deacons still had not appeared then charles sims their leader burst in he said there had been a shooting in another section of town there might be danger we would have to wait a while longer nothing to worry about he assured us mr young came in rushed to a telephone there was buzzing

orleans is a lovely green shadowed drive at night the shadows hang like ghosts the highway from bogalusa is the loveliest in louisiana we sped out about  am on to lake ponchartrain and new orleans black country theater usa  the free southern theater is now evolving toward a black community theater this course has been determined as much by the experiences of the fst during its three years in the south as the theoretical beliefs of the company of course black community theater is one of those terms like black_power which can mean different things to different people lets take a step backward and look at fst properly within the broader perspective of the black artist in america not only does the black artist work in a society basically hostile to the aspirations of his people but he has little audience among his own people especially the writer and actor we tend to forget that literature and theater are first mediums albeit highly sophisticated of communication and the art of drama and literature is always extremely influenced by the attitudes and values of the audience we take this principle for granted but it has a special meaning for the black american writer for the black american writer writing for a primarily white audience usually imposes a serious limitation on the choice of approaches to his material we could reduce these approaches to two far too monoleveled bags neatly bound either the writer satisfies the demands and assumptions of the white audience or he as several are now successfully doing attacks the assumptions of the white audience with a hostility that at least satisfies the need to reject a society built on racial and other hypocrisies for the black actor performing in theaters owned controlled and supported by the white establishment means performing in a commercial atmosphere totally divorced from the culture which produced him and almost always becoming involved in a vehicle which must make money from white theatergoers to survive and even these jobs are very rare only a theater which plays for and to the black community can alter this situation thus open up new possibilities for black writers absolutely essential contact between the writer and the people he is writing about is reestab w lished thus the fundamental communication between artist and audience becomes possible such a theater offering the multiplicity of disciplines unique to theater can provide a conduit for the exploration of new themes and patterns which have really never been explored by our writers because this particular relationship between writer and audience has always been absent and if such a theater is even moderately financially successful it means jobs for black actors under conditions conducive to the development of an art not merely a commerce experience with the fst which has been playing to  per cent black audiences affirms the necessity for a theater so integrated into the issues and immediacies of the communitv that it becomes func  tional and necessary and the experience of playing for black audiences also proves that the particular form of attack on the status quo employed by white artists such as the beats and the folk music crowd are not usually relevant to the problems of the black community also too often the particular form of rage employed by black writers against american facism designed for a white audience is not usually successful when applied to a black audience this means black theater will demand new plays written for black audiences it also suggests that alliances with white artists lose their value when such alliances man the sacrifice of our racial concept of reality any of this could be developed further by analyzing for instance the dilemmas of the black writer on the lower east side of manhattan scene or by analyzing the extent to which black theater or the black writer is of necessity more involved with a political and social art i would define black community theater as a theater which exists for and relates specifically to the black communities and which performs a critical function toward the values of white america and the values of the community of which it is a part that other thing which has at some points existed in the afro communities we may call negro thespian culturaluplife theater which is not what i have in mind the fst in  began to move in the direction outlined above particularly because of the urging of founding director gil moses the program was modified to  choose plays which had a particular relevance to our audience with postperformance discussions retained to evaluate effectiveness and break down the distance between stage and audience  devote more time to new orleans through workshops in drama afroamerican literature and writing and to hire the most interested and talented teenagers as apprentices  build a theater in the desire project section of new orleans suitable for both performances and an office though the  season involved the most extensive schedule of performances it would be misleading to claim the realization of all the above objectives the full potential of the workshop program can only be exploited when the company can obtain a fulltime black community workshop specialist who if funds are available can stay in new orleans on a fullyear basis the workshop program is extremely important it means planting seeds which will not only insure the life of the theater as an indigenous community force but also planting seeds which will perform the essential functions of racial reeducation reevaluation and strength and to make the program work the fst needs funds to spend more time in the south than the seven months it was able to operate in  it would also be misleading to  imply that the changes in direction came easily in a company which has from its inception established its own artistic principles through vigorous debate redirection of program took a tremendous emotional toll a definition of principle no matter how simple it may sound when stated here required a reevaluation of the role of fst so fundamental that only the obvious need for such a theater saved the company from dissolution in the black community is there a need for theater at all when so many other needs seem to take precedence are workshops which have the advantage of dealing more directly with the community more valuable than performances what is the role of the white actor if any in a theater which is designed for the black community is traditional theater too refined or removed to capture the immediacies of the black community once the company resolved some of these issues and avoided floating away on the waves of perpetual theoretical discussion four shows were prepared gil moses aforementioned roots our own poetry show utilizing the works of contemporary afroamerican and african poets does man help man by brecht and i speak of africa by william plomer played as a doublebill the most critical and enthusiastic audiences are not the new york sophisticates familiar with theater or the drama but people who relate in the most natural and sophisticated way to what happens on the stage that is when the theater accepts the obligation to present something which relates to the lives of the audience and does it well sometimes the discussions were more entertaining than the shows the poetry show almost precipitated what would have been an extraordinary scuffle between lovely denise nicholas and a booker t washington black policeman in a desire church does man help man provoked a sncc staffer to threaten to slap down a morehouse prefreshman in atlanta as success means audience community involvement this is the measure of success as the fst approaches its  season there is for the first time solidity of structure and enough funds to enable planning for a few months last year the company received a  grant from the rockefeller foundation which made possible the extension of the season through june july august and september this year the rockefeller foundation awarded fst a followup grant of  the amount for three seasons earmarked for each year to decrease annually approximately   is budgeted for  the new york foundation has also contributed  thus with a budget of roughly  after  bills are paid the fst is assured of a six or sevenmonth season paying approximately twelve people an average of  per week this money does not include allowance for a workshop director in new orleans for more than the six or seventh month the company will be able to stay together for the workshop program to work the community director shuld really operate on a yearround basis the current budget also does not include funding for apprentices teenagers who can only afford to spend time with fst if they are paid because all of them need summer jobs if we cant pay them theyll get a cleaning job somewhere to conclude that the present budget provides for more than a minimum program would be an illusion to augment financing the board of directors has worked to expand its friends of the fst committee in new york and to create a similar group in new orleans led by mrs celestine cook mrs lucille segre and rev milton upton approval of federal tax exemption on gifts to fst has been an encouragement but the fst has hardly received generous financial support from people in new orleans the friends groups are also important for as the theater continues to play a politically and racially controversial role it may be very likely that foundation support will cease at the same time it is important that the fst remain a free theater because only a theater which performs without charge can reach every level of the community and what is more important every age group this season the company will produce another poetry show utilizing the works of young black poets it is also hoped that a youth who plays and sings firstclass new orleans blues can be enticed to join the company for blues which is such a historically viable art in black culture must be explored to its full potential in a black theater fst is looking for scripts by black writers but experience with black audiences is of prime value  a few final personal messages  to murray levy see you in madrid after viewing la guerre est finie  to denise nicholas roscoe orman joe perry gil moses john oneal see you in madrid  to gordon parks thanks for the station wagon but it has had it if you know anyone else who wants to duplicate your generosity have them contact fst at box  new orleans immediately will send driver  to sam hill john cook arnold innis gil mathews ollie smith freddie donald dehon lieteau and gil fletcher madrid i love you the fst belongs to you
