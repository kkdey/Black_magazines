two paraphrase mark t twain everyone talks about the black revolution but no one does anything about it the movement seems to be unable to recover from the martyrdom of malcolm and unable to learn from and be guided by his life his death was a terrible blow but martyrs are often more effective dead than alive malcolm achieved immortality during his last year when he rejected racism and embraced orthodox islam a universalist religion by escaping from the trap of reversing the symbols he freed us to create new symbols many of his followers cannot understand the profound significance of malcolms religious conversion experiences and try to reduce him to a vulgar political figure both black nationalists and white liberals each for their own reasons ignore malcolm the universalist humanitarian because the black revolutionist has not learned enough from the life of malcolm he tends to become a cultist offering ritualistic compensation for blackness andor a poseur playing the role of spokesman of the black masses for the benefit of those white folks who dont know any better the masses is a great abstraction for the black revolutionist if he comes from a bourgeois family he does not know them and has  been taught to despise them if he comes from the ghetto he escapes from the masses into revolutionary politics usually a cathartic talkmarathon signifying nothing the ghetto is hard to take cold sober everyone finds an escape religion for old ladies alchohol for the mature drugs for the young the children are the only realists the black masses as an abstraction is an invaluable defense mechanism for the black revolutionist to relate to the people of the ghetto to look unblinkingly at their faults their virtues their suffering their potential to give love and compassionthe only thing that can win their confidencerequires saintliness k william kgositsiles article is the black revolutionist a phony negro digest july  is the first breath of fresh air on a scene that has become an exercise in futility it is honest it asks the questions which must be asked it is oriented towards psychic autonomy as a constructive substitute for the sterile game of reacting to whitey when he says we are inherently more interested in humanity than in the material values of the white western world he has pronounced a liberating phrase a philosophy that can transform the black masses and detach them from things as symbols of power and loveobjects which are a cold compensation for helplessness and lovelessness there is a certain dignity in avowed slavery avowed slaves work because they are captured or kidnapped or sold or born into slavery they are chained and beaten thats why they work for their oppressors even the wage slaves that marx wrote about in the th century had some dignity they worked or they starved thats a good reason to work but the modern western worker works because the system stole his mind he strives for things which represent worthiness and the less worthy he feels the more desperately he strives this craving for objects as symbols of power and love poisons relations between husband and wife between parents and children he ends up loving no one and nothing but his car i think polishing ones car has become a widespread form of sexual perversion a psychologist should think up a name for it the modern western worker may work harder than a slave and never think his own thoughts but he believes he is free and to me that is the very depths of degradation for all the extraordinary qualities of the ghettoized their perceptiveness their basic grasp of reality their ingenuity inventiveness adaptability ability to endure and survive stress to an almost incredible extent their latent spirituality and transcendence they still largely accept the image which the white world has of them the children still insult each other by calling each other black and nigger or saying  your mother is blackin spite of all the newly independent nations of africa and because the black masses are at the bottom of the pecking order the ghetto becomes a caricature of empty materialist values e franklin frazier called the black bourgeoisie exaggerated americans its not just the bourgeoisie the ghettoized hardly believe in their own existence and cling to objects and roles in dread of nothingness the black criminal clings to his evil if you tell him hes not evil he panics malcolm came up from degradation that is normal it is the degraded of the ghetto who have the greatest potential they are the least socialized the unwilling slaves to society never the willing slaves rewards mean little because they never expect to get any punishments they learn to live with they must either become saints or die and everyone knows that the ghettoized are experts at survival if the black masses are hung up in the material values of the white western world the black revolutionary intellectuals are hung up in the social thought of this same white western world any theory is an attempt to make some sense out of reality but theory like logic is not truth it is a tool which when properly used helps man to understand and cope with reality when the theory masters the man  it screens out the reality that conflicts with the theory during the th century when western man became enamoured with science he convinced himself on the basis of faith that there were laws which determined the development of society that man was profoundly rational and that one had only to discover these laws and point out to ones fellows where their selfinterest lies to solve the problems of the world social thinkers in the west marxist and nonmarxist alike are still caught up in this delusion their response to their failure is more and more frantic intellectualization which only serves to further aggravate their alienation from reality and to insulate themselves from their intuitions the result is intellectual escapism compounded by a feeling of helplessness in the face of inexorable social forces freudianism while correcting the view of man as essentially rational added a new ingredient of panic the unconscious was evil and destructive holding terrible secrets which we dared not face i believe contemporary western social thought is an intellectualization of martin luthers vision of man as absolutely depraved and lacking in free will the enthronement of rationality stems from distrust of emotion the concept of man and society as being determined by inexorable laws stems from denial of free will the externalization of social change processes reduced man to the role of a cipher but if we allow ourselves to perceive the reality of social change we find that the revolution is not so much out there as it is in herein the mind and soul of man because man tends to become what he believes he is spirituality is a powerful highly contagious emotion and in my view mankinds most profound emotion a revolution in the psyche of one man can become an allpowerful force for social change st malcolm was such a man the historical evidence is impressive and i hope the reader will bear with me while i make a detailed summary of the findings of the distinguished anthropologist anthony f c wallace wallace studies revitalization movements which are attempts to abruptly innovate whole cultural systems shifting relationships into a new pattern they are reactions to extreme stress induced by an unsatisfactory society and an attempt to reorganize society in order to reduce stress he made a comparative study of several hundred religious movements both western and nonwestem on five continents and abstracted common features of these movements for radical change those involved in such movements perceive the culture or major areas of it as a system feel that it is unsatisfactory innovate not merely discrete items but a new cultural system specifying new relationships and in some cases new traits wallace projects the concept of the mazeway or the image of nature society culture personality and body as seen by one person the mazeway is related to concepts of self worldview and behavioral environment wallace does not explain the mazeway too well but i think he means it is the socially determined manner of perceiving and evaluating which screens out sensory and evaluative data which conflict with what one expects to perceive within the framework of what one has been taught to perceive wallace says that when stress is unrelieved the person is under great pressure to change the mazeway while wallace does not explain the cause of the unrelieved pressure i would speculate that such stress arises from a sharp and growing conflict between the image of the world as perceived through the mazeway and the world as it exists in reality or applying the concept to the united states at the present time unrelieved stress results from the conflict between the intuitive knowledge of the world which is strongest in the young and their sociallyconditioned conscious perceptions and evaluations changing the mazeway involves changing the total gestalt of the image of self society culture nature body and ways of action it also may be necessary to change the real system by this  think he means the social structure to bring the new mazeway and reality into congruence the effort to work a change in mazeway and real system together so as to permit more effective stress reduction is the effort at revitalization and the collaboration of a number of persons in such an effort is called a revitalization movement all religions have their origin in revitalization movements societies go through five overlapping stages in what he calls the processual structure  the steady state in which people are reasonably satisfied with the culture except for a few individuals for example psychotics  period of individual stress in which growing numbers of people are subject to increasing stress and begin to consider alternatives  period of cultural distortion which is a prolonged period of  stress and anxiety provoking the following responses a rigid response the person tolerates high stress rather than admit innovation b flexible response new techniques more or less in conflict with the mazeway are adopted in personal life c regressive response uncontrolled dissipation introgroup violence passivity dependency indolence psychosomatic disorders depression and selfreproach corruption in public office the culture becomes internally distorted stress continues to rise resulting in disillusionment with the mazeway this period could lead to the death of the society or to the fourth stage  revitalization or mazeway reformulation the movement promoting revitalization can be religious or secular but it always begins with an abrupt and dramatic moment of insight a realization of relationships and opportunities in the mind of one person such an event can be described as inspiration or revelation in religious movements the prophet or messiah receives one or more visions the content of his message is universal obey the moral rules and practice the rituals or personal and social catastrophy will result in secular movements or religious movements in which the innovator does not see visions the process is a moment of insight but in all cases it is sudden and dramatic a radical inner change in personality takes place soon after the vision experience the one receiving the insight or revelation feels a sense of mission or messianic obligation
the visions have been called personality transformation dreams they occur in a waking state or in an ecstatic trance and impress the dreamer immediately as being meaningful and important their manifest content is largely rational a wellconsidered intellectual argument and a cogent moral exhortation the personality goes through a radical change in a positive therapeutic sense prophets believe they have communicated with the supernatural but unlike psychodcs they do not lose their sense of personal identity but psychotics tend to become the object of their spiritual longing once the mazeway reformulation has been completed the movement enters into a second stage which wallace calls communication the prophet attracts disciples and converts who believe they are coming under the care and protection of a supernatural being and that both the convert and society will benefit from identification with the new culture system the next stage is organization during which the movement takes shape sometimes there is a division of labor between the prophet and a disciple who is the organizer or political leader the converts to the movement undergo a revitalizing personality change the next stage is adaptation as the movement becomes stronger resistance is provoked and it evolves strategy for coping with resistance some strategies are doctrinal modifications to make it more acceptable political and diplomatic maneuvers and force the next stage is cultural transformation in which the entire or controlling portions of the population accept the new religion re vitalization occurs reduction of personality deterioration symptoms extensive cultural changes enthusiastic embarkation upon organized programs of group action these programs can be more or less realistic the next stage is routinization in which the new mazeway finds general acceptance the movement shrinks to a purely religious function eg the preservation of doctrine and the performance of ritual finally a new steady state emerges which is viable and different in content from the old steady state wallace says there are two major variables determining the success or failure of the movement the realism of its doctrine and the amount of force exerted by its opponents if the organization cannot predict successfully the consequences of its own moves and of its opponents moves in a power struggle its demise is very likely in order to survive the movement must be canny about conflict and the amount of resistance must be low the conventionality of the doctrine does not appear to be an important variable the doctrine can be extremely unconventional as long as the leaders are realistic i have burdened the reader with a detailed summary of the wallace article because i find his view of secular revolutionary movements as being essentially religious more convincing than the view that religious movements are essentially secular in short i have more faith in faith than in rationality but more important i believe that wallaces concept of the revitalization movement is extremely relevant to the black revolution and to the role of malcolm in it it seems clear to me that malcolm is the revitalizing messianic figure capable of saving a society on the brink of destruction if his followers can recognize who he is and emulate him any movement which leaves the old mazeway intact is necessarily shallow and manipulative slogans such as we want what youve got implies that what youve got is of value a revolutionary movement must be realistic i am afraid that revolutionary theoreticians trapped by enlightenment social thought emphasizing the struggle out there and seldom realizing that there is a struggle in here sometimes go to absurd lengths trying to apply hoary abstract theories to problems which they obscure rather than solve one example is the definition of the strategic goal of a revolution as seizure of state power there is some real basis for such a concept in the deep south especially in the rural black belt area such an attempt in large urban centers in the north is not cool at all but it is perfectly realistic to be the real power in the ghetto and outside the ghetto in relationship to racist murderers or potential racist murderers all that is needed is the confidence of the masses effective black institutions render white institutions irrelevant and because many theoreticians consider economics the most essential question they tilt at windmills trying to find a fundamental economic solution which does not exist one can demand jobs ad infinitum and get no more than token results if not reversals because the structure of the economy is precipitously reducing the demand for unskilled labor some say that the answer is socialism but a substantial number of whites would have to go along with such a solution then what happens to the autonomy of the black revolution unless one projects the seizure of power and the carrying through of a socialist transformation by blacks on their own that does not strike me as very realistic either another variant of the search for a fundamental economic solution is the ideal of a separate autonomous black economy the latter solution i believe is as unrealistic as the former if the black revolution can become the real power in the ghetto many of the abuses especially the parasitic ones can be corrected while this is not a fundamental economic solution it would help along with the usual demands for economic reform perhaps the black masses may never have what whiteys got but why not encourage people to become themselves instead of aspiring after the rotten materialist values of the west when m kgositsile makes the impassioned cry where is our program of action he articulates the feelings of many people possibly one explanation for the paralysis is the impact of western social thought which is in an advanced state of decay lets hope that we can surprise ourselves not out of the window but into the ghetto to relate to the real flesh and blood people who live there
i feel it incumbent i g upon me as a young t black deeply committed ° g°a  s °   ffer  menting black liberation movement to respond to some of the conclusions and implications suggested in dr price m cobbs analysis of the american identity crisis as it manifests itself in urban insurrections and violence by black people in general journeys to black identity negro digest july  without doubt dr cobbs analysis is a brilliant and refreshing explanation of the psychopathology that plagues black and white america he states in no uncertain terms basic underlying motivating factors which scientifically explain the violence  blacks now perpetrate in the streets of american cities indeed i think his article may be regarded as a major psychosociological essay concerning violence and identity as it is related to the black liberation movement and for this dr cobbs is to be given full credit and a sincere extension of gratitude from all of us who are constantly attempting to come to a greater understanding of problems we are facing however i cannot help but take issue with some of the concluding inferences suggested by his article when dr cobbs states that black men in america can only go part of the way alone in the establishment of his manhood and that the attainment of an effective and mature manhood by black men can in the final analysis only be permanently achieved through cooperation with others i am forced to denounce this kind of reasoning as logically as well as psychologically inconsistent with a true understanding of what is real in the white psychological milieu the recognition that many whites in america suffer from the same identity problem as do blacks thereby linking them in a common bond so far as the identity problem is concerned is indeed a correct and valid observation and i take no issue with dr cobbs on that point what i do take issue with dr cobbs on is his inference that this might serve as a uniting bond between the dehumanized blacks  and the dehumanized whites and together these two dehumanized identitydenied groups may effectively strike out against the thingscentered culture that has dehumanized both of them i choose to label the situation that black and white people in america have been subject to as one of dehumanization of which the identitydenial problem is but one aspect of this more inclusive program once again i am forced into a position of complete agreement with dr cobbs insight regarding the violent potentialities of other nonblack identitydenied factions of the society indeed the history of white racist lynching validates this point beyond repudiation however i think the dynamics of identitydenied violence and its possible manifestations by nonblack members of this society need further explanation with whom are manhoodidentity seeking blacks to unite for the effective establishment of their manhood and identity since according to dr cobbs they cannot travel the entire length of this road alone are they to seek and expect help from those persons who in attempting to dehumanize them have been dehumanized also whence is the coalition to spring besides is a coalescence between the dehumanized dregs of white racist america and an anxious angry and aware also armed black america desirable or even feasible these questions are obviously rhetorical any clearthinking man whether he be black or white can easily recognize the absurdity of dr cobbs position if black manhood and black identity are to be truly authentic and significant it can only be meaningful and lasting if it is fully and completely the fruits of an allblack effort the same applies to the white identity and dehumanization problem if it is too to be effective and meaningful it must be achieved wholly by white efforts granted that the problem that confronts both groups is the offspring of the same parents decadent christianity and misguided capitalismbut the children have grown and matured in two entirely different settings any attempted merger of the two at this ripe old age could only result in compounded chaos and confusion let us examine for a moment the most possible manifestation in which the identitydenied violence of white america might declare itself as noted earlier this type of violence already has a rich history of manifestation in lynchings castrations and rapes to assume that they will in the future be directed toward someone other than black people is i think unjustifiable moral and historical naivete what is more likely to take place is that the more blacks move to recapture their humanity and establish iden	 tities whites will attempt to block this with every means at their disposal for we must remember that the valuesymbols of identity and masculinity that white americans have managed to delude themselves into thinking are meaningful have been maintained and realized at the expense of black people and the harder blacks try to establish a meaningful black identity the more they undermine the foundation on which socalled white masculinity and identity rest for the only common identity conscious or unconscious that most white people share is that of white superiority the only way most white men in america experience some feeling of masculinity is by identification with james bond or tarzantype pictures or by some outright oppressive acts of violence against blacks to be sure whites have an identity this common identity that they have is based on their unconscious collective acts of oppression against blacks and is no more real than the images they have forced on blacks and the unreality of it becomes increasingly more apparent as blacks move towards liberation through affirmative acts of violence the more blacks seek to acquire their identity through affirmative acts of violence the more white america will respond with totalitarian and oppressive acts indeed what is at stake is the whole system of white superiority values on which rest their identity symbols the fact that both whites and blacks have an identity problem only heightens the possibility of armed confrontation between the two groups it does not mitigate the possibilities nor can it serve as a uniting force as dr cobbs article subtly suggests indeed the present psychological symbols for masculinity in america conflict directly with what i understand to be the aims of the black liberation movement frustrated white identityseekers will most assuredly seek to identify with these symbols blacks are moving to destroy and replace the present white symbols of manhood and to a certain extent already have been successful the more successful they are the more desperate white identityseekers will become til finally they will attempt to resort to their most base and blatant display of manhood castration or murder of black men and savage rape of black women this i maintain is more likely to be the manifestation of white americanidentity seeking for in actuality white america is not really seeking an authentic identity historical truth would cause them to go insane but rather it is attempting to preserve and perpetuate the existing identity valuesymbols one closing note relative to the concern of dr cobbs that the american identity may remain white while the democratic system is destroyed the main problem of the socalled democratic system in this country is that it has always defined and manifested itself to black people as wholly and completely white american in identity indeed the two are inextricable the coalition between white and black identity seekers is a historical psychological and moral impossibility the achievement of black identity and authentic moral manliness can only be achieved by black people alone the denial of this by dr cobbs is scientific inconsistency or academic infantilism i cannot help but detect in these outlandish purportments by dr cobbs that same old slave cowardice and feeling of helplessness and estrangement whenever the slavemaster is not permitted to run things
in the last few years the trend in womens hairdos has turned towards the natural look popularized by miriam makeba odetta and joanna lasane pictured above in the laymans circles only the hippest women are supposedly brave enough to wear it in a black nationalist sense it can be viewed as a symbol of feminine freedom from white standards increasing numbers of women have begun to wear naturals and this would seem to indicate that more black women are interested in exhibiting some racial pride however even though this may be true we should not overlook the fact that frequently the visible signs of protest and radical movements become meaningless and mutilated over a period of time because people who want to be hip and inpick up the symbol for whatever social gains are attached to it they are in many cases to tally unaware of the aesthetic idea which produced it one wonders if it is fair to count them as converts to the new religion i choose to call black who if anybody should wear her hair natural what does it mean when a woman cuts her hair wears it short and kinky in a world where negroes are trying a different brand of race pride everyday certainly there has been enough printed matter on what it means to be a negro in america but reading such material is obviously not the weapon we need to handle the situations we know of unless it can teach us to understand and then manipulate the audacious situations which daily confront us the most conspicious way a black woman can protest the prevailing beauty system is to cut off her hair when i was a child the old folks used to say man is gods glory woman is mans glory and hair is womans glory and the interpretation of this has been the more hair the better the straighter the better and the longer the better but those who can only read their names can point out that the book does not specify long or short glory straight or nappy glory and so on nevertheless black women have for years waged losing battles with hot combs grease sweat rain water of all kinds and origins to adhere to the standards set down by the system when the howl for integration began and finally died down to echoes of assimilation the  wig and permanent had their most elaborate debut here was a way by which one could transcend the humiliating reminder that one was not white forego all the heated discomfort of maintaining ones glory the result was instant whiteness only the skin remained to point out the enlightened and the ignorant and once again we rocked our chairs too far backwards and our piecequilted values slipped off our laps yet we rocked content that at last we had patched up the ugly and they laughed and made money off our mixmatched blackness we do not know nor can we imagine who the first modern afroamerican woman was to shove the system into the melting pot and wear her hair mostly the way it was we can be certain however that when she did this a new kind of homosapien was revealed to her she met whites and black bourgeoisies who were furious and disgusted by her lack of judgement and tasteher nerve for extolling the ugly she met brothers and sisters who laughed and turned their heads because she was a mirror and their reflections were too bright too clear people stared on buses and leaned out of cars and muttered go back to africa and nappyheaded devil black women apologized that they had nothing against it for those few who could wear it but that they couldnt because their faces werent the proper shape their hair not the kinking texture excuses were given when none were asked excuses came when none were needed and the real issue was obvious we have been lumped together into huge bags made of lies that the power structure invented and now the bags were full of holes and decaying and we were stupidly fumbling around trying to stay in them the lies black is evil and ugly thick lips and kinky hair are unsightly and so forth and forever if we let it be we were spooned the lies and we digested them and when we first saw and tasted black beauty which is a part of black truth we were experiencing a food we have been starving for throughout  years of mental embalment for the natural look is only one crumb of a giantsized loaf of bread black pride is the main dish it can be served in the form of studying our beautiful black history wearing african clothes thinning shoe leather in marches and countless other ways the real issue is not the hair its only importance lies in its relationship to the whole black pride is the menu and it can never be served too often for we can spice it up or water it down like hash and potatoeswhenever it is set before us we will always be able to recognize it if it is who should wear the natural look and what does it mean all those who want to be in that way black beautiful and trueand these are no small things for in truth there is strength and therein lies freedom it is worthwhile for me to mention and important for those who question the unfamiliar faces of black truth to know that someone with perhaps a tanned but not so black face will remind them when they forget that essentially there is no difference between the blacks who wax in afroamerican style and the negroes who wallow in archaic white standards the fire that mr baldwin speaks of will be allconsuming allencompassing and when charlie turns the hoses on and attempts to put it out those emulating him will not be protected by any plastic invisible shield we will all get wet and we had best arm ourselves with steel shields of blackness coated with red rubies of

campbell is s £ an actor at detroits £ concepteast theater a bushyhaired barrel or a black man who likes to strut on stage and trumpet a poem he composed entitled let freedom ring kaping kaping he mocks a rifle at its conclusion then after a pause comes the cruel irony damn fool dont you know thats freedoms ring campbells verse devastating in its directness describes a state of mind that is mushrooming in his town detroit where night snipers came to symbolize avenging assassins and in the explosion of their rage completed the birth of a breed of black man who is unafraid as a result in the days of endless dialogue and search that have followed the detroit riot the mantle of leadership has been resting more and more on the shoulders of what had been virtually an underground movement the motley group of people who call themselves black nationalists for several years detroit had been considered the center of black nationalism overshadowing even new york but the ferment of its fiery activists had drawn little public note now it is inescapable heading the citywide citizens action committee ccac formed in the riots wake for instance is rev albert cleage wouldbe politician veteran organizer a man whose angry fires scorch black people are tired of hearing i had a dream america is a nightmare the rev mr cleage calls his church central united church of christ the  black nationalist church and the ccac which nominated officers at a rally attended by several hundred citizens some community leaders and organization heads now is known as the new black establishment this new establishment proposes to negotiate with and give orders to the new detroit committee composed mainly of leading white businessmen which is charged with planning the citys rebuilding ccac includes according to militant attorney milton henry some moderates some not so moderate a few who are a little radical and others who are just plain out of sight this surge of community involvement by selfstyled militants while not unexpectednationalists have built noisy if shortlived confrontations around every crisis from a poverty program cutback to a high school student boycott occurring in the past five years nevertheless has deep implications now for detroit where the nations most destructive riot has triggered an identity crisis of mass proportions middleclass negro leadership which had boasted of its ability to freely enter the smokefilled rooms of the white power structure now is in a frantic race to reclaim its connection to the negro whose plight was its only real excuse for being meanwhile this socalled negro mass seething with unlocked tensions seems likely out of the torment to spawn its own leadership the fact that leadership from the outside cannot be superimposed on this mass no matter how desirable this leadership may seem to outsiders was well demonstrated during the riot young do rag nationalists and others jeered and flung rocks at young and supposedly popular u s rep john conyers jr nearly toppling his halo in the process but as conyers himself later admitted only someone with the violent connotations of a malcolm_x could have spoken with authority to the rioters for the destruction in detroit went beyond the point of selfhating negroes lashing out at their own environment a feeling which still can be channeled through promises of improvement the naked thing that conyers confronted was the release of pentup rage by some fairly middleclass as well as lowerclass negroes and even poor whites that had been so long suppressed it was uncontrollable when it burst free a civil_rights program supposedly is not built on rage but in reason yet for black nationalists particularly black internationalist revolutionaries who consider themselves part of the worldwide struggle by black people to end their oppression anger is the prime mobilizer and this is the detroit dilemma the struggle now for the still largely uncommitted mass is being waged between the established negro leadership and the more militant forces so far aided by a greater facility for the gut talk of the people since they often are the people the militants are winning this battle their cries for action unity and change effectively capitalizing on the mood that lingers with the cinders in the citys ravaged communities it is a mood that unmistakably calls for many meaningful responses to the explicitly expressed discontent some nationalists and the term often is elastic enough to include even an outspoken speaker had begun to seize control of the riot when it was forming in the streets some do rag brothers who are considered incipient nationalists encouraged looting and arson while a few internationalists are believed to have aided the mystery snipers a riot is not a revolution explains glanton dowdell cochairman of the rev mr cleages ccac and a man who says he believes in black nationalism but sometimes at its height people geared to it find it necessary to intervene so people dont become mutilated a disciplined revolutionary will not participate in or encourage a riot unless there is no other alternative in detroit maybe there wasnt author louis lomax who journeyed here in the midst of the destruction felt nationalist involve ment in the riot had been crucial charging in a frontpage series in the detroit news that door to door salesmen peddling black_power had set the stage for the rebellion several weeks before its fires erupted and it is a fact that the celebrated blindpig whose raiding triggered the violence had also been a meeting place for minors under the tag the united community league for civic action nevertheless most local observers now agree that the riot was largely spontaneous but nationalists understandably are not surrendering without a struggle the rich philosophic gains that are theirs to be snatched from the holocaust in the riots midstream richard henry brother of milton and a technical writer issued a list of ultimatums to the city in the name of the malcolm_x society including amnesty for rioters which he claimed would quell the disturbance predictably the ultimatums were largely ignored but a key weapon remains in the hands of nationaliststhe drive for unity unity for the time being is a goal of the entire negro community    unity in demanding changes unity in resisting any resulting increase in the forces of bigotry unity in defining the real needs of negroes and interpreting them to the white community and this goal of community unity closely resembles the black nationalist goal regardless of geographic boundaries language differences etc one told me we are one part of a black nation first and above all else detroit nationalists also are remarkably unified themselves separatists who want countrystates for negroes work with nationalists like rev cleage who believe negroes must control their own communities and the do rag nationalists who quote malcolm_x but imitate whites by processing their hair this new call for unity which now finds many people thinking temporarily or permanently like nationalists can be unsettling to both negroes and whites a white employee of a downtown office cornered a negro coworker proud of his white collar and equally white diction the other day and whispered worriedly say eddie what about this h rap brown why ask me i dont know as much about him as you do was the offended eddies swift reply eddie of course was lying h rap brown drew an audience of  persons many milling in the streets when he spoke here recently at the dexter theater and eddie was one of them the shift to the open airing of nationalist sentiment is even more evident in the pages of the formerly conservative negro weekly the michigan chronicle shortly after n the riot rev cleage was given a column in the chronicle and one of his first pieces was entitled unite or perish avowed nationalist henry slayton also has begun writing for the chronicle one article headlining black_power can build as well as destroy the fact is the nationalists kind of talk is beginning to make sense to many negroes particularly youths who are turning inward for solutions to their problems including the new fear of genocide through vietnam which is gaining currency in the community the only people the white community respects are those who speak up nadine brown communitylabor figure and newspaper columnist who openly identifies herself as a nationalist told a ccac rally and some of the people present had heard many other speakers received many promises in this town where labor unions taught negroes the meaning of militancy and organization and the auto industry built hopes in a growing middle class that society never quite fulfilled malcolm_x had whipped some into a frenzy of bitterness but spurred no action and then came stokely carmichael with his black_power in a year when congress reversed itself the dream of integration died during martin_luther_kings march in chicago africa its customs and hair styles became palatable and the momentum of the rights movement screeched to a halt now there is something on the scene called black nationalism and it is a search a state of mind a hardening conviction that whatever went before was inadequate the detroit challenge is how the middleclass negro is to keep the place that he has won while others find theirs theres lots of negro prosperity here but too many guys arent getting a piece of the action the chronicles managing editor a dunmore told a new york times reporter yet dunmores words are tame alongside those of slick campbell kaping kaping he fires at his audiences who always sit silently awaiting the inevitable fury damn fool dont you know thats freedoms ring 
recently a peoples tribunal was con£ vened by the citywide  citizens action committee ccac at central united church of christ at the last moment the tribunal had to be moved from the dexter theatre because of pressure from the white power structure the executive board of central church came together immediately in a special session and unanimously granted the ccac permission to use its building the vote was taken after dan aldridge and lonnie peek cochairmen of the tribunal working under the legal department of ccac advised of the threats pressure and harassment which had been used to intimidate law yers witnesses and members of the committee central church officers stated quite simply we love our church and the building in which we worship but even if granting permission for the peoples tribunal to be held here means the destruction of our building as churches have been destroyed in birmingham and all over the south we still have no choice we serve the black messiah jesus of nazareth who came to unite and free an oppressed black nation our brothers have been brutally slain and it is only right that the voice of truth silent in the corrupt halls of justice should ring out in the house of god so the peoples tribunal was held under the soulful eyes of the beautiful black madonna the  foot painting by detroit artist and ccac cochairman glanton dowdell which dominates the sanctuary of central church and still another miracle of the many miracles which have been  performed by the black madonna since her unveiling last easter sunday came to pass fear was driven from the hearts and minds of black brothers and sisters the first miracle had occurred the day after the unveiling when glanton dowdell and general baker arrested in connection with last summers kercheval rebellion had received suspended sentences not only the officers of central church were touched by this strange fearlessness the witnesses despite warnings not to testify and innumerable other efforts at pressure and intimidation appeared and testified is it not peculiar that their testimony which the prosecutor had considered not worthy of use in the regular court was considered too dangerous for use before a black peoples tribunal for every lawyer who found an excuse not to appear two more volunteered members of the committee worked around the clock investigating and sifting evidence one member was forced to remove his telephone to stop threatening calls to his wife until the tribunal was actually under way the committee could not be sure that an injunction or some legal maneuver would not be used to block the hearing as had been done in  to prevent the playing of a tape of officer speichers testimony in the cynthia scott murder on the very night of that meeting everybody involved had been served with an injunction the brothers and sisters dont know what fear is any more in spite of the last minute change of location they began to arrive at central church at  pm to be sure of a seat by  pm the sanctuary and fellowship hall were filled to capacity and people were still coming from everywhere more than  people were in the building and others were outside trying to get in it was a beautiful tribute to those black young men whose lives were taken in senseless acts of police criminality there is no way to put down on paper the sheer horror of the recital of events by witness after witness it is hard to believe that such bestiality could exist in the world that a group of ordinary white men could so hate ordinary black men yet it is so we should have known it before from the days of slavery from the days of reconstruction from everything that has happened to us in this land of the free and home of the brave but always we have tried to forget to close our eyes to reality to pretend we should have known when systematic genocide was introduced in mississippi to kill innocent black men women and children who dared to demand constitutional rights reserved only for white men women and children we should have known when black boys were systematically drafted out of all proportion to our percentage in the population to die in vietnam we should have known it in a thousand ways and deep down within each of us we have known but we have been afraid to face the truth but fear is gone horror remains but fear is gone indecision may still exist there may be different ideas about what should be done but fear is gone as the witnesses testified the packed auditorium became more quiet than a courtroom each individual relived the horrible moments faced by three unknown black boys victims of nothing more profound than the hatred of white men who hated them because they were black as i listened and looked out at the crowd i could not help thinking of the paintings by jon lockard that hang in the lobby of the church i thought of the painting of the black messiah the strong black face under a crown of thorns suffering beaten humiliated but undefeated and when a mother cried at the witness story of the death of her son the indignities he faced the senseless cruelty of his dying i could see the picture of mary at the crucifixion i wonder if the crowd as it filed in orderly quiet through the church lobby and into the street saw in the tears on her black face the tears of black mothers in every generation who have seen the cruelty of oppression and its effects upon their sons and daughters but fear is gone mary may cry at the crucifixion but she is not afraid black men may be crucified but they are not afraid and in some strange new way we are forging a unity of the spirit which binds us together in love and in dedication to freedom thousands of people came together in testimony to this fearlessness and to this dedication we are living in a new day detroit is a new city and black people have a new spirit
during this writers high school and college days in detroitin the forties and early fiftiesthe power structure through its spokesman the local daily press fastened onto one negro leader as the epitome of respectability and acceptability for the black community that man headed the local branch of a national service organization whenever there were signs of revolt out there on the west side or on the north end or especially down around paradise valley and environs the editorials rolled forth to admonish the blacks that they had it good and that they would do well to aspire to emulation of that esteemed leader who had found large sympathy in the white community and to prove how well considered their man was the power structure elected him for the umpteenth time to some position on some commission where he was the first negro he was wellrewarded for his services to the cause of the status quo this muchadmired negro leader was the most colorconscious man i have ever met black or white as a feature writer for the michigan chronicle in the fifties i once went to talk to him about the prospect of utilizing a section of his headquarters for meetings of a writers and theater group an idea whichto his credit appealed to him since he had some years earlier sponsored a similar group during the half hour or so of my interview this man amiably discussed people we knewor knew ofmutually invariably making some comment or description which referred to the individuals color people were light brown or very light or dark brown or deep tan or dark or quite dark or black or very black and it was very clear that people occupied niches in some hierarchical structure in his mind and affections according to the amount of melanin in their skins i never had occasion personally to go to the agency this man headed to seek help in the areas in which it functioned but i had friends who did some of them luckless people later complained that preference always seemed to go to the sons and daughters of socialites and that those favors which the agency was in a position to grant did not necessarily go to the most qualified candidate it was an old story needing no substantiation it is the way life is but not the way life has to be    during those years in detroit society was the thing scarcely an edition of ebony magazine hit the streets without some gorgeous photographic coverage of a grand ball a grander debut or an even grander weekend at a country estate or private island if black people were denied jobs and refused service in downtown sandwich shops gerrymandered into substandard schools or routinely beaten up by the police these things were regrettablebut bearable after all there were edward turner and art johnson of the naacp to handle such matters and turner and johnson did what they could routinely over on detroits west side and up in pontiac some  miles away a trio of young men were making noises against routine racial discrimination and the routine response to it the detroiter was albert b cleage jr pastor of a presbyterian church the other two were suburbanites milton henry an attorney and his kid brother richard they were troublemakers young cleage had a hassle with the bigwigs of his church and ended up by dressing them down the henry brothers kept the temperature hot around pontiac disturbing the peace in every area from housing to police methods and their enemies made appropriate trouble for them eventually members of the cleage family joined with members of the henry family and launched a newspaper designed to express the general dissatisfaction of detroitarea black people they also tried other publications all failed which is another sad commentary on black people not on the cleages and troublemakers stuck to ven in the dry years before the black revolution sparked down in north carolina and burned gradually northward they stuck to their guns and their targets were as often the apathetic socialites spreading the ghetto out through oakman boulevard and seven mile road the new gold coast the power structure labeled the troublemakers racists and the socialites naturally echoed the charge however something new had been added to the old scene the black revolution had liberated a lot of negroes turned them black and made it acceptable at last for black people to say what they always had thought they said it and to everyones surprise thousands of black folks out there in the ghetto responded by the time a brash young rebel named stokely carmichael exploded upon the scene black people had been aroused to their possibilities as never before and they no longer needed to pay homage to the socialites and to the leaders the power structure had selected for them in detroit the cleages and the henrys were joined by a string of talented and forwardlooking people with the new vision among them artist henri king artist glanton dowdell bookseller edward vaughn attorney andrew perdue james boyce alvin harrison william flowers and nadine brown an organization called forum  came into being sponsored two successive black arts conventions see page  and sparked a renaissance of blackoriented thought and activity spreading its influence across the nation the malcolm_x society a semisecret organization sprang into existence during the summer of  the malcolmites made a list of demands on the inevitable commission named by the city administra tion to study the causes of the detroit rebellion the demands included governmental cooperation with community institutions in rebuilding and relocating houses and businesses the election by districts of city councilmen school board members and police commissioners neighborhood participation and veto rights in urban renewal projects a policy of compensatory employment of black people and compensation for all black people illegally arrested and inconvenienced during the rebellion a detailed plan for the redevelopment of the th street area center of devastation during the rebellion was drawn up by the malcolmite society rendered by artist henri king and presented to the newly formed community council and land cooperative the point welltaken and strongly emphasized that black people are going to decide how their communities are to be built and operated the comprehensive plan proposed the construction of a complex of low medium and highrise apartment buildings a series of recreational centers a small industries park compact shopping centers new schools and libraries a professional and business plaza a community theater a community art center parks playgrounds and a complex of single and multiple dwellings in the wake of the rebellion cleage and his cohorts joined with other concerned detroiters to form the citywide citizens action committee ccac an organization which through unifying the black community could serve as a lever in negotiations with the new detroit committee a similarly new organization representing the traditional power blocks within the greater community for all intents and purposes the black people who are directing the new organizations represent the new black establishment in detroit few of the old leaders are heard from the daily newspapers no longer seek to impose on the restive black community the leaders they have chosen and a new sense of pride and yes of power is clearly visible in the faces and in the voices of the ordinary black people the new black leaders have aroused a new kind of hope in detroit
something happened to detroit it happened suddenly though not without prior warning it hapned with thorough tactical prossionalismthough apparently ithout leadership it happened by visible people whom even negroes generally did not know or recognize this something happened to the city and the whole city while all of the citizensnegro and white were baffled and unbelieving spectators upon their own paralysis before it is over it will have cost the citizens possibly  lives and over  million dollars in looted vandalized and burned business establishmentsand in burned and gutted homes and apartments an even greater cost will be the sudden sacrifice of the justified and still justifiablereputation of this city as being the only city among all the major cities of the whole nation which has taken as many creative initiatives in human and community relations and which has built as many strong bonds of interracial and interfaith coalitions it is the one major city which escaped such violence for a quarter of a century it still is farthest along in the establishment of a genuinely viable democratic community where almost everybody has a meaningful role in the total enterprise of community life that is everybody except the totally alienated what happened had no clearly enunciated rationale and none has yet come forth from any participant or spokesman it had no identifiable leadership yet it happened suddenly swiftly sweepingly apparently without need of these although the phrase race riot was used by communications media for lack of better terminology it was clear even to the news media that this was neither a race riot nor a racial demonstration in any previous sense of that phrase or by any parallel with any events of the past decade yet it also could not be characterized as a rebellion or an insurrection by reference to any present experience this is because too few are acquainted with negro historyand particularly with the early revolts of both slave negroes and white identured servants it takes this special knowledge of american history to see the precedents in connection with previous demonstrations and riots we are accustomed to seeing the buildup of overt hostilities and to witnessing eloquent appeals of spokesmen being denied or ignored before the main event there was none of this prelude moreover the acts of vandalism then burning and then sniping generated neither ethnic political civil_rights moral nor social rationale to sustain them yet they were sustained one most baffling fact is that no apparent and certainly no sustained hostilities were aimed at either groups or persons other than those specifically charged with authority to restore order or to quell fires there was no person against person fights no gangs chasing either negro or white persons no racial encountersand no general diminution of interracial communication and social intercourse at any level in the community if anything one became suddenly conscious of a heightened degree of interracial cooperation throughout the community this costly tragicomedy defies even symbolic association with the racial epithets of the black_power clique it is strictly a negative power demonstration by the alien within our midst that alien has racial symbolism but no race we are yet to clearly understand this the phrase black_power which cropped up early and disappeared of its own inappropriateness really had no emotional force in an atmosphere of interracial looting interracial vandalism interracial incindiarism and interracial sniping except for the location of the initial incidents the event cannot even be described geographically as a ghetto phenomenon so quickly did it travel from the ghetto to the avenue of fashions and the boulevards of luxury establishments even that move was highly selective in targets the important thing is that within the initial target area and before the spreading flames took their own toll as a result of firemen being hampered the targets were exclusively business establishmentsand those were selected as though on a predetermined schema moreover the thoroughness of the selection and the completeness of the destruction of so many business establishments in so widely scattered parts of the city in so short a time had all of the earmarks of professionalism well rehearsed timing and even tactical preplanning yet supposedly no professional leaders were evident in any overt identification in fact no leaders or leadership types were evident equally important there were no acts of violence directed agains any private persons or racial groups as such during the entire course of events there were none of the chasings beatings gang attacks or killings of private persons such as characterized the detroit race riot of  or the many subsequent demonstrations and riots elsewhere throughout the nation that we have witnessed since  in no sense was there persontoperson hostility on the contrary there were constant and paradoxical observations of a peculiar sort of quasihumorous circus atmosphere like the annual student riots at fort lauderdale floridabut different in addition there was the specific absence of any gang patterns even among the snipersprobably the most astounding and foreboding fact is that better than  per cent of the entire population of this metropolis was caught completely unaware of such a possibility even as it was occurring the few prior scattered weekend events with definite racial overtones on three or four successive weekends were handled by due process of law and were accepted by the community on the merit of that process but those events did not involve the completely alienated when this event struck upon us with all of its costly and devastating fury its participants were not recognizable to any of the more than  human relations civic religious protest and even extreme protest groups which have been vocal and active on social issues in detroit nor did they enlist the support or participation of any of these groups or organizations in any cause that they represented as the looting and vandalism progressed for in truth they did not represent a cause they represented a fact what then is this fact this fact is that the elusive they have many highly developed skills which the national society even in the best city in the nation will pay a dearer price for not using or for turning into expert destroyers rather than training them and using them constructively we must not fail to see the symbolism in the simple fact that a blind pig raid provided the generating spark so long as we continue to force a choice upon those who are alienated which tells them that they can in factfind a more lucrative life and more peergroup acceptance by engagement in illegal than in legal activity so long as the school dropout cannot find acceptance among any respected and legitimate employers and so long as he knows that even if he does that employer will not be able to compete in wages and personal fringe benefits with the illegal business enterprise then so long will it be a basic pragmatic and attractive choicethe same kind of choice made by the other  per cent of americans to adopt willie suttons law and go where the money is but once gone and once in the pattern of seeking success through that route his powers must then be developed refined and utilized by such as will hire and use them for illegal activity so we had better start our route to repair by clearly distinguishing in our own mind between the notpoorbyincome poor criminal and illegal operators from the real poor for it is evident that their chief victim is the poor we also must separate in our own minds those who are clearly bent upon the destruction of our society from legitimate civil_rights activists for it is evident that the formers goals are completely incompatible with the existence of a community in which civil_rights has any meaning in this connection we had better begin to be much more discriminating and sensiblein the national interestabout who is characterized as a negro leader a destroyer is not a leader except to destruction it is imperative that negro or whitewe distinguish between negro leaders and both negro and white destroyers we also must not be too quick to label a product which we have massproduced in our own communitys educational social and economic system a criminal as though that ends the problem that is where the problem begins we produced them their values ar	 our values their wants are our wants but our good life is not their good life and our belonging is not their belonging since they do not have open and constructive routes to the achievement of these our avenues are not their avenues to the enjoyment of the things we take for granted and they demand either to have these things or to see us pay a terrible toll for their being so denied this is their plain economic pragmatism moreover the wider the gap between the affluent and the alienated the narrower the perimeters for choice either way become and by the fact the more closely does any community approach the prospect of recurring violence this we can never afford and survive so now we have a different kind of confrontation than has appeared before in recent history for this was a revolt a revolt differs from demonstrations as we know them from riots as we know them and even from insurrections for all of these latter are overt in both leadership and design revolts are covert devastating and sudden not since the gabriel prosser and nat turner revolts of the nineteenth century have we seen this phenomena several commentators made the mistaken comment that this was the biggest riot in american his tory they were far from righton two scores this was not a riot and it is not the most costly even in detroit history in human lives the faulkner riot perpetrated by white persons in march  cost more lives and proportionately more property finally we have become so accustomed to our social concerns about those who are segregated from the mainstream of society that we just have not developed the social instruments and programs to really enfold those who are alienated from the total society now even in this most progressive city of detroitthey have got around to us and when they got to us we had no readymade racial answers because they are both negro and white we had no economic palliatives because they are not among the organized and visible poor we had no moral response because the morality of nonviolence has not brought to them the rewards it brought to us we had no community response because when we have seen them they were in but not of the community moreover it must give a peculiar satisfaction to a person who has been denied induction into the military service to see himself pinning down soldiers for  minutes with sniper fire in his own private warand then escape never forget no matter how strong we are in our bonds of community and no matter how con cemed we are for the continued health and growth of our city the alienated are not the same as the segregated the segregated are part of the society itself nothing in the recent history of demonstrations and even riots is comparable to the revolts of the alienated so such attempts at analogues will be futile we must go all the way back then and study the dynamics of early revolts to learn what the present events in detroit and elsewhere have been about and when we study them we should find that the rebellious slaves and indentured servants shared these three things in commona concealed but deep resentment in their consciousness of complete alienation an unswerving desire for the better things they saw around them and a devastating capability for sudden destructive and seemingly unorganized revolts against authority for those who have continually demeaned these people and argued that the community and the nation should not make the extra effort to reach them should not make the extra investment in their more realistic education training and selfimage building should not make a larger investment in their adjustment to the constructive and legitimate job market should not be concerned about the investment in and reorientation of services for their health family and environmental improvement should not expand upon the programmed efforts at finding with them a place of belonging and respect and personal dignity in our community and in our society whatever this cost in lives property community pride and fear of swift destruction from sources unknown is only part of the price that we must continue to pay for not doing so with the recent superimposition of the theory of violence upon the formerly nonviolent moral thesis of the civil_rights movement even detroit has not been good enough or strong enough to be spared if it can happen in detroit it will happen anywhere else in this nation however if we bring to bear upon this community after this shock the same constructive and creative resolutions which have carried us through  years before we shall find a way to open up alternatives to them that will both spare us and embrace them and that better voice of detroit will be heard again in our land
the new chairman of sncc h rap brown daniel watts editor of liberator mrs betty shabazz charles p howard and the reverend albert l cleage were speakers at the opening session of the second black arts convention sponsored by edward vaughns forum  in detroit june   and july  and  that was prior to the detroit rebellion sessions were held in rev cleages central united church we didnt make the laws

the reverend cleage said meetings like this would always be welcome in his church howard said we can change the system only through black_power he defined the black mans enemies as big business big labor the church and some civil_rights lead ers watts said that the white mans freedom is the freedom to exploit when we cry freedom with our warmth the white man doesnt understand us there is no dialogue he said blacks did not need a separate state that there are laws providing for local areas to part from governing bodies and form their own governments june  was devoted to a youth conference and july  was given over to panels and workshops in the panel on religion islam and the yoruba religions but not the christian religion were represented when moderator milton henry asked what could be abstracted from the different values henry wells said neither islam nor christianity are effective he urged the conferences to forget individualism and to accept collectivism drew ali bey and b i bey advised the panel to work together on what is good in a religion not to concentrate on its faults the yoruba spokesman said the arabians were notorious slave traders and advised using the native yoruba religion as a base and traditional beliefs as a guide to government in the panel on literature rhobena nelson stressed the need of selfknowledge and selfidentity francis ward associate editor of ebony said the responsibilities of the black writer were to devote himself to the struggle for equality and freedom to give leadership through his writing to discover and promulgate black history and to interpret the condition of the peopie the black writer may have to be both writer and activist ward said adding that since he knows his own life best he may start from there then later write on larger areas the black writer doesnt have to leave such questions as love hate and war to white writers ward said he suggested that there is a fine line between art and propaganda leroi jones writes on black problems but has literary skills and is a genuine artist bobb hamilton poet artist and eastcoast editor of soulbook went further into wards ideas he said that literature communicates emotions and analyzes and criticizes events it can destroy and that is not bad and should be done hamilton said he added literature is inseparable from the life of the people black literature was destroyed although negroes are trained in engineering and economics these have no cohesion literature is as important as religion it forms a people dudley randall poet and publisher said that the themes of writers conferences had been first the role of the black writer then the black audience and the trend of opinions was that the writer should write as a black man and to and for the black audience we are a nation of twenty million and could support a flourishing literature he proposed a national book council sponsoring a national book week and an organization to promote the creation and distribution of literature and to disseminate information about literature later a group of writers and editors met and listed what each wanted and what each could provide amer rashid and ahmad malik shabazz who said he was the first black man to enter rice university read their poems shabazz said a new breed of poet was coming out who went deeper than surfaces and caused the reader to go deeper they used the art of leroi jones  images symbols rhythms without rimes line endings and split lines to suggest their meanings instead of direct presentation in the panel on racism in education arthur reese said that americas schools were racist from the beginning many teachers have provincial parochialism and criticize a students grammar and ignore his meaning reese said the teachers not the students are culturally deprived as they cant communicate with their students he suggested teachers say black history should be integrated but how can you integrate truth with myths reese asked how can you teach that thomas jefferson was a hero when he was a slavemaster the solution is not to put black teachers in black classrooms for many of them are white with black skins the solution is to force schools to teach as they should david llorens assistant editor of ebony said the quality of education must be improved american schools are for training not for educating james baldwin richard wright and malcolm_x taught me more sociology than anyone ive ever come in contact with it is essential that black people control schools in their neighborhoods llorens stated a teacher who understands stravinsky but not james brown shouldnt be teaching black children he said the american educational system teaches you that the white man is humane and therefore you cant believe america supports haiti south africa and similar regimes a mother mrs helen kelley related a problem she had with a sudden change in her daughters program causing her to spend fifty dollars more for books she said parents have to stay in the schools and demand their rights in the panel on art charles enochs statement that art must communicate and serve the purpose of the movement was challenged by henri king who said he didnt go along with the idea of being used he was against social editorializing and artists making themselves hacks painting black christs and malcolm_xs this was only imitating king insisted the role of the black artist is to create something new and dynamic to destroy everything in art today and replace it with something new he has created king said he also warned that using african art is commercial as it wasnt created for fine art harold neal disagreed saying that artists must stop being a specialist and must be like any other black man fighting for his freedom he didnt go along with tired white boys who introduce a series of dots one year and are hailed by critics who have to find something new king said that black artists have not created their own art form that black musicians have enoch agreed that black people have no soul art that can be looked at and called soul art neal said that no black painters have responded to the murder of medgar evers or to the bombing of the four girls in birmingham on july  the delegates voted that each should send a letter to howard university protesting the firing of dr nathan hare and other professors and the expulsion of activist students and that forum  should send a telegram of protest to the university and one to dr hare supporting his efforts edward vaughn asked all organizations to forget differences of ideology and to form a national liberation front within the black arts confederation of unity dudley randall presented mrs betty shabazz with a copy of the memorial volume of poems for malcolm_x titled for malcolm which was signed by all the poets in the book in attendance at the convention joyce whitsitt and le graham included in the book read poems on july  there was a parade and the convention concluded with a speech by dr vincent harding of spelman college on the gift of blackness he said that black people have a beautiful heritage some may want to put down part of it but the whole heritage has beauty and can help us to obtain our freedom he said he praised the beauty and the poetry of the spirituals the afroamerican can change things and he must not forego the spiritual aspect dr harding warned
the national foundation on the arts and the humanities under pressure has added four negro magazines to the list of more than  which are consulted for material for the american literary anthology annuals the four magazines are phylon freedomways black dialog and soulbook for those readers who are not familiar with the whole flap involving the national foundations american literary anthology and negro magazines here is a brief rundown the national foundation in  granted  for the publishing of an anthology of literature compiled from the little magazines published in this country by little magazines the foundation had in mind those independent and universitybased publications dedicated to bringing out the literary works of writers of talent who have not yet received recognition by the literary establishment there are as the  number cited above illustrates quite a lot of these magazines some of them appear for only an issue or two and then fold and so there are always new ones on the scene what the foundation proposed to do in its annual american literary anthology was to select from these magazines the best of the poems stories criticism sketches and essays publish this work and then generously reward the authors and editors each poet whose work was selected would receive  a gargantuan sum when it is recognized that most of the little magazines can afford to pay nothing at all authors of stories and essays would receive   the editors who originally selected the work also would be rewarded handsomely to preside over this project the foundation chose george plimpton a rich society dilettante who has written several books a committee of established writers all white was named to judge the material these writers were robert creeley and john ashberry for poetry walker percy and william styron both southerners for fiction and robert brustein john thompson and benjamin de mott for criticism a year ago negro digest contributor william barrow wrote to carolyn kizer director of literary programs for the national foundation on the arts and the humanities informing her that as the project was conceived negro writers would be excluded from participation in it mr barrow explained that the racial realities being what they are few negro writers ever are published in the little magazines he proposed that the people involved with the anthology therefore had the responsibility of seeking those publications which welcomed the work of negro writers he named negro digest among other magazines miss kizers reply to mr barrow was lofty in the extreme she implied that the magazines listed did not qualify as little and did not emphasize literary content and furthermore that it would be counter to the law to give special consideration to negro writers the thrust of her argument was that if negro writers were not represented in the conventional little magazines then tough  barrows argument and received pretty much the same response from washington there was not even a suggestion that the foundation might relent and consider negro magazines even though negro digest submitted a list which included liberator soulbook black dialog and freedomways however negro digest had decided not to allow the foundation people to ignore black people so cavalierly pressure was mounted articles appeared in negro digest and finally when no satisfaction from the foundation was forthcoming letters were dispatched to the offices of all the negro congressmen that brought a response toward the end of august a letter arrived from the foundation signed with the name of roger l stevens the top man stating that freedomways black dialog soulbook and phylon had been added to the list of more than  magazines from which material is culled for the anthologies the liberator and negro digest were not included because it was felt that the material which they contain is not primarily literary any more than the work of magazines such as the nation and the new republic    well negro digest still feels that black writers are getting shafted in this deal but the fight is in the open some concessions have been made and others can now take up arms if they feel it important enough the first anthology will be published by farrar straus and giroux in the spring and  has been set aside this year for the second anthology to be published a year later throughout all this flap with the foundation an important fact has emerged it is simply that the black establishment writersthe writers acceptable to whites but usually considered irrelevant to the negro cause are being used as consultants by the white people at the foundation that being the case it is to be expected that those black writers will be favored who embrace the artforartssake approach to writing incidentally saunders redding former professor of literature at hampton institute and author of several books including a new novel is the top negro at the foundation he is director of the division of research and publication

ernest j gaines can write rings around dozens of american novelists with far more glittering reputations a quiet serious young man with no apparent passion for selfpromotion he has not forced himself upon the public stage where so many contemporary writers are busy gilding their eminence in  when his first novel catherine carmier was published not even his publishers atheneum seemed inclined to provide him with that necessary public relations push which would have brought the novel a share of the attention it deserved for catherine carmier without question was one of the finest novels of that season in a notice of the book in negro digest the reviewer termed mr gaines a writer with artistry in his touch he has the gift of perception and an affinity for that truth which is larger than the lives he creates in several stories published subsequently in literary magazines and later collected in anthologies mr gaines artistic touch has remained sure the stories like catherine carmier have been concerned with the lives of ordinary people black and white and inbetween in the rural louisiana of the authors own beginnings the inbetween is important in this context for the complex legacy of several interrelated traditions and institutionsslavery the french language and culture and creole societyremains strong and viable in the land of the bayous and yet author gaines is concerned with these traditions and institutions only insofar as they establish a frame of reference for his themes stated gen erally these themes revolve around the conflict of eras the new world of mobility and expanded possibilities impinges on the old world of landlove and solid accepted social stratification the old realities of the plantation culture gradually surrender to the demands of industrial pace and technology the oncerigid poles which separated ruling whites from cajun and cajun from mulatto and mulatto from black have been bent all out of shape mr gaines describes human beings caught up unwittingly and often unwillinglyin a quiet and inexorable revolution and there are subordinate themes in the sky is gray one of the authors first pubished stories a painfully poor black mother by a single act of simple pride teaches her young son and demonstrates to whites who would patronize her the great dignity inherent in the human soul in a long day in november another of mr gaines long lyrical short stories full of the nutty flavor of rural southern life a sixvearold  mt boy watches his tormented father savage his honorand his marriage in a day of gentle but terribe crisis in catherine carmier a cofieeveducated young man returns from california to the ancient greataunt who adores him knowing that he must shatter her hopes by informing her that he never again can share with her the old values and customs of his childhood in his new novel of hove and dust published under the banner of a different house dial mr gaines combines all these themes weaving them into a subtle literary tapestry which no amount of sensational writing or sociologizing can equal of love and dust set in  tells the story of a brash young louisianans headlong journey to doom marcus a handsome irrepressible rogue has murdered a rival in a knife fight in a baton rouge tavern andon the plea of the noble old woman who reared himhas been placed in the custody of marshall hebert owner of a vast plantation a still viable remnant of southern feudalism hebert represents power he is a law unto himself and at his word marcus can be either sentenced to prison or set free pending his trial marcus is put to work in the fields with sidney bonbon a harddriving cajun as his overseer bonbons task is to break the spirit of the arrogant marcus a job he undertakes with accustomed relish but the citybred marcus is not so easily subdued though brutalized by the tedious work he remains unbowed not only that but he succeeds in scandalizing the black people on the plantation by his uninhibited womanizing fully knowing the danger he nevertheless courts pauline the beautiful black woman who is the overseers lover failing at that he stakes out an even more dangerous prey he decides to seduce his overseers childlike wife louise one of those pale creatures left loveless in the big house while her man is off tumbling in the sack with black servant women marcus daring leads inevitably to disaster this simple outline of the story cannot convey the texture or the depth of the humanity with which if is told all the characters are vibrantly alive they have been clearly and truly seen and all the intricate relationships and undercurrents which characterize the pattern of existence in rural louisana are traced with skill and certainty aspects of the story are classic the white master with his black concubine and the mulatto children he cannot legally claim the myriad black servants and retainers profoundly wise in their subservience a greek chorus in blackface the murderous secrets which propel the corrupt overlords toward still more murder and degeneracy and yet none of this familiar material is treated with banality marcus story is told by jim kelly in his own language the simple unadorned language of an intelligent if uneducated black man of honor jim is a tractor driver on the plantation an unbonded worker and the man who would be marcus friend like all the other black people on the plantation jim at first finds marcus overbearing and despicable a man totally lacking in humility and humanity but later as fate catches up with marcus jim makes a telling discovery he finds that it is his own fear of breaking the old taboos of claiming his own manhood which made him fear and hate marcus he begins to see marcus less as a villain than as an emergent hero he begins to understand that marcus violent and dangerous behavior grew out of marcus refusal to submit to rules of living which violated his manhood marcus jim learns at last was a man of honor and integrity in the fashion he had adopted for himself because he could not accept the pattern that had been imposed upon him when jim first learns of marcus fantastic plan to escape from the plantation with louise whom he has awakened to life jim feels that marcus has gone mad but gradually realizing that marcus could have gone off alone to safety rather than risk everything by taking the woman along jim sees that marcus has begun the climb upward from the armor of inhumanity with which his bitterness had clothed him marcus act of love has reclaimed him in the end jim leaves the plantation knowing himself a better man because of marcus it is not possible given the elements of the story that of love and dust will find the popular audience it deserves because the novel deals honestly and from a black viewpoint with the commonplace but nonetheless delicate sexual relationships prevalent in the bayou country it will bemust beeither downgraded or dismissed by the critics whywriting in a recent issue of negro digest ottilie markholt explained the critics can acexcept long suffering oppressed negroes who may be pitied she said but they cannot accept strong free black people who know they are morally superior to whites but neglect of this novel will be a crime against literature the critics keep crying for good novels and they keep ignoring them when they appearif the novels do not say what the critics want to hear in the way the critics want it saidhoyt 
john oliver killens sippi trident press  has been heralded as his most ambitious novel after reading all  pages of this novel i decided that mr killens first line in this classically bad novel should have been once upon a time there was a fair white golden haired maiden who lived in the big house on the hill and a handsome black boy who lived in a shack down in the valley on the girls fathers plantation everyone knows the story by heart naturally the goldenhaired one and the little black boy are going to meet in the woods the bedroom the tree the cave or wherever and fondle each other innocent sex play but in mixed hue this is the beginning of what proves to be a series of deadly plodding events that all lead nowhere the black boy goes to college in the south white girl goes to school in the north and falls into an integrated group of bland clicheplagued middleclass negroes who talk as though theyve been expertly programmed to blare their class times and color black boy and white girl make it in new york black boy has been making it all along with an older woman in college town a kind of growing up white in black skin or something meanwhile down in sippi civil_rights is the thing white folks find out that black folks have changed black folks find out black folks have changed little black boy goes back to mississippi to find himself and become a part of movement some people are killed and black boy realizes that hes colored too and joins the elders all the characters move through sippi in two dimensional sleepwalkers stupor saying things that are expected of them in light of the plot and message they just dont come to life these shadowy people are used as good propaganda foils now there is nothing wrong with this kind of polemic it just is not a novel i find it impossible to say anymore about this novel  do not object to the theme the people the locale i find that it is not art we know nothing more about the people the situation and the past or present than could be casually picked up from reading the new york times perhaps the fault is that there are too many writers who have not learned that there is nothing so deadly as the stereotypical southern racial conflict southern sexual dilemmas and southern myths which give us nothing more than southern racial conflicts southern sexual dilemmas and southern myths whether white or black these writers had better move beyond the history books and the present psychological lore and tell us something about our dreams nightmares and partial consciousness and in so doing engage our total being in this experience as painful or joyous as it may be to do less is not a sin it just is not artronald williams saunders redding has written a book called the negro potomac books  in which he says among other similar things the following    negro writersincluding poets playwrights and novelistsconsider themselves spokesmen for their people in the s and s the best of them were speaking more clearly and were listened to more attentively than ever before richard wright was one of the first of these but wright moved permanently to france in  and lost touch with the living reality of america italics the reviewers the passage might have been written by any number of removed white critics referring to the new negro selfimage mr redding credits the american press and indeed all the media of mass communication with reacting to this image responsibly italics the reviewers apparently mr redding is familiar with an american press and a mass communication media which manages to elude most of the rest of us but that kind of statement is rather general throughout this little book less than  pages of text which could not have been conceived for the consumption of black people in any case this is not a harsh judgment writing of the widely publicized fracas at the united nations following the murder in the congo of patrice lumumba mr redding says the following blaming all the worlds troubles on american imperialism and the white mans inborn perfidy and pretending to see this nations connivance in the murder of patrice lumumba the first premier of independent congo a rabble of these extremists staged a riot in the un that interrupted ambassador adlai stevensons first speech to the general assembly italics the reviewers it sort of speaks volumes for itself volumes mr redding never intended to peak mr redding by the way is a government man currently director of the division of research and publication for the national endowment for the humanities the negro is one of seven books in the publishers the usa survey serieshoyt w fuller

support your los  cal police the  g bumper sticker read vs and i should have known better from  the way he slowed in front of me before he got to the toll gate and from his hesitation and his annoyed ahhh the hell with it gesture that he gave me crouched over from the cold but i should have known not to relax as i ran up behind the car after it stopped my eyes on that bumper sticker support your local police but then the harrisburg exit of the pennsylvania turnpike seemed a gateway to the below freezing winds and i had been trying to get any kind of lift for all of two hours thanks i said

lexington the radio says theres a snowstorm cornin from the midwest yeah thats what i heard this morning after that it didnt take much prodding from him to get me to take the swing below the mason dixon and out of the path of winter i entered the south almost without looking back i told him that i was going to san francisco to get married and find a good job he seemed to believe that my fiancees name was patsy mae and that she worked in a laundry pressing shirts and that i usually found work as a janitor or in a car wash thats the story i usually use when hitchhiking all over the country to everyone marriage and janitor or car wash ive learned that that story works on nearly all of them for hours i can spin out fantasy about my patsy mae and how good life is going to be for us especially if i get work in a good firm out west like dow or lockheed or boeing and how california is famous with us colored people all across the country for them wonderful lifetime jobs i tell these stories with a straight face and sometimes talk  so much about patsy mae that the more brainy of my benefactors become bored with my conversation but i know better than to tell them that i am a writer especially a playwright and that im going to the west coast this particular occasion to see one of my own plays in los angeles and to see and make love to an old girlfriend of mine in san francisco people get upset when you tell them the truth some might even be hurt especially those who have strange stickers on the bumpers of their cars now what if i would have said im a playwright involved in the black revolution and im hitchhiking to california to see one of my black revolutionary plays or im going to see my exgirl friend shes white you know winking as i say it and i dont honestly know truthfully whether im going to see my play out here cause ive seen it already or to see her smiling at my own candor shes very nice and white being jewish and raised in st louis but actually born in texas so more than likely you have much in common with her now i couldnt say that could i those answers shouldnt come from black hitchhikers writers or no and since i knew this i changed my speech

jason jerked his hand  it back into the cell in another second it would have been crushed by the heavy steel door licking his burned finstared incredulously through the bars at the obese guard why did you do that he demanded what you know put that cigar out on my hand oh that drawled the guard i just wanted you to move it sos i could shut the door jason was so angry he could hardly see he could focus only on the guards huge neck bulging from a grey collar on which was stamped mississippi state penitentiary he longed to grab the red splotched neck to squeeze it until the network of blue veins stood out like railroad tracks but he was out of reach he banged his good hand against the bars but realizing the futility of his anger he turned away from the guard to face the other fellows who had been packed into the tiny cell with him a few filled the space around the toilet the others stood cramped between the two steel bunks in the dim light he squinted his eyes searching for chenault he would know what to do chenault was lowering himself onto a bottom bunk his face brown and lightly freckled was rigidly set jason had known him for five years since they had been seniors together in college they had worked together and slept in the same room but he had never seen chenault so tense maybe jason thought chenaults worried about the others who were arrested with us during the demonstration smart of those cops to pick us out as the organizers and bring us up here to the state farm left all the other demonstrators in the big compound nobody left to work with them hope theyll be alright willie c a tall thin boy in overalls broke the silence chenault ben say the guard told him he was gonna take all us clothes away say he be back to get them after he finish his dinner what must we do i dont feel right without my pants on i dont want to give up my clothes the others crowded together on the bunks and began to argue over what to do jason spoke up over the noise of course i want to hear what chenault has to say first but i think we ought to go along with what the guard tells us we dont know how long well be in here before the office can get up the bond money but its gonna take a long time to raise  you saw what just happened to my hand obviously these guards can do anything to us they want and nobodyll know about it til its too late lets give them the clothes willie c whined chenault what you think we must do im scared shut up willie ben shouted you sound foolish chenault aint no more than anybody else in here just cause he talk bout concepts and such dont mean he know better than me or you what to do bout these crackers stop begging him to tell you what to do and think for yourself ben sprang to the floor and strode the twostep limit to the wall of the cramped cell he was a short paunchy black man whose age was somewhere between   inserting his thumbs in the bib of his blue overalls he said now i think what jason said was wrong he just got to mississippi a month ago aint been in jail a time in his life before now and he gonna tell us how to act i know these crackers and if we start giving in now theyll keep pushing us harder and harder to see how much crap they can make us eat taking our clothes just the first thing they gonna do to break us down and show that they the boss man here jason looked to see chenaults reaction to the problem of the clothes he sat quietly staring impassively at the huge door why doesnt chenault say something certainly he knows tluit this first decision is critical we have to stick together have to react in a unified way it was chenaults practice to encourage everyone to speak to draw out the opinions of the less vocal and then to come up with a plan which reflected the feelings of everyone this plan was usually accepted immediately and with a sigh of relief but now he didnt seem to be listening jason willed him to pay attention come on man get on the ball this is important we got to face that guard chenault remained quiet lifting his head to listen only when ben spoke jason knew that chenault gave special weight to bens opinions since they usually reflected the opinions of the other local mississippi people who worked with the movement and everyone in the cell except jason and chenault was local people but maybe it wasnt so bad if chenault wasnt listening to the others it probably meant that he had heard his own decision in what the others were saying and he was checking himself against bens words after a half hour of argument someone asked chenault what you think we should do chenault pulled his glasses down on his face and leaned forward he spoke so softly that twice his voice was obscured by the flushing of the toilet i think what people are saying is that we have to show the guards were not afraid of them and yet keep them from shooting one of us to do this we have to agree in advance on what things well do and what we wont like whether well work in the cotton  fields for them that way were setting our own terms for our existence here and as long as we know that the guards havent broken down our terms were still winning ben interrupted come on chenault get off that theoretical crap and make your point its getting late and that guard be back in a little while do yo uthink we ought to let him have the goddam clothes or not chenault grinned at bens reprimand ok man i got carried away i think we should give him the clothes cause he got the jump on us he made a demand that we werent ready for lets give up the clothes but also lets decide right now on what were going to do while were here so well be ready next time whew thats right give him the clothes and live to fight another day they agreed to give up all their clothes except their shorts there were some halfhearted jokes about chenault who didnt wear underwear and a final agreement that he should keep his pants they also agreed on what they would do if the guard tried to take chenaults pants from him jason stacked the clothes near him at the front of the cell and then rejoined the discussion on how they would conduct themselves while they were in jail they decided that they would not work in the prisons cottonfields that they would not let themselves be separated for any reason and that they would have only the necessary communication with the guards     ah thats better firmer ground we know what were going to do still such a depressing place though cant even see anything through that little window up there blocked by a tree jason relaxed onto the bunk and rested his head against the stone wall from here he was the first to see the dull grey uniform of the guard who was bellowing something about handing over the damn clothes why the clothes are right down here cant he see them oh that vain mothagraber cant see anything cause hes watching his own shadow must get a kick out of digging the outlines of his power the shape of his gun and the lines of his billystick next thing you knew hell be cracking that whip in the air like a damn lion tamer finally the guard dragged his eyes away from his shadow and into the cell his glance bounced off jasons naked chest and down to the pile of clothes his mouth contorted into a smile so you niggers decided to act like you got some sense thats good cause i aint gonna take no crap off you your white friends aint here to help you now better get in your mind that you dont run this place i do now gimme them clothes and he reached his hand into the cell jason jumped back offended by the moist mealy texture of the guards hairy arm as it brushed past him when no one offered up the clothes the guard just stood there grinding on his cigar and shifting his eyes back and forth between the clothes and the naked prisoners as his eyes became accustomed to the darkness he recognized that chenault still wore his pants withdrawing his arm and pulling his pants up over his stomach he shifted his weight so that he faced chenault nigger you think you better than the others or something i said for you to take off them clothes chenault answered quietly we agreed that since i didnt have on any underwear i should keep the pants well it aint my fault if you dont know how to dress looks like i gotta take them pants off you as he unlocked the door and entered chenault and the others locked arms to form a chain roughly stepping on jason and the others near the door the guard tried to get in close to chenault muttering curses he tore at chenaults pants legs pulling his feet out and suspending him in the airjason tightened his grip on the arms of the fellows next to him burn me will you well you wont win this time you aint getting those pants for several minutes the guard pulled at chenault and the prisoners pulled back all the while kicking at the guard when it became obvious that the guard would not remove the pants singlehandedly the prisoners began to laugh and to sing the guard continued the tugowar from time to time he would drop the bottom half of chenault onto the bunk and try to attack the prisoners with his whip but the cell was too cramped and the space between the bunks too narrow for the whip to have any effect the pulling and kicking and singing continued until jason heard laughter from outside the cell he looked out and saw two other guards they were covering their laughter with looks of mock solemnity need some help in there joe one asked the guard threw chenault back up against the wall and wordlessly made his way out of the cell when i need your help mothagrabers ill call you he said to the other guards and stomped out of the cell block    c c they slept that night on the steel bunks and concrete floor without benefit of mattress or cover each was awakened in the winter night  by the extreme cold the guard had turned on the large fans in the wall when he left the cell block the next morning jason heard a great clamor he opened his eyes to find the guard banging on the bars with his club behind him a black trusty was standing holding an armload of striped clothing get your asses up time to go to work here some clothes for you to put on hope you wasnt cold last night were not going to work for you chenault answered as the guard digested this news jason observed a violent purple color rise up his neck by the time the purple reached earlevel it seemed the guard would explode he belched out one great stinking burst of air and with obvious effort reigned himself in alright he muttered through clenched teeth dont work but if you dont work you dont eat you wont last long you be begging me to let you work and he marched off with the trusty behind him this time he turned on the heat as he left the cell block along with the others jason tried to recover the position in which he had finally been able to get to sleep during the night his limbs felt as if they would never come straight again might as well twist myself back up between willie c and these bars maybe get another hour of sleep before the heat builds up but chenault would not let them go back to sleep he sprang up and went briskly to the commode relieved himself and rinsed his face in the wash basin as he washed he called out alright fellas cant let this place get to us you can go back to sleep later if you want to but at least get up in the morning he then went throughout the cell coaxing each fellow up and over to the wash basin he got some of them to do exercises with him they did pushups and climbed up the bars yodeling at the top like tarzan and yelling back insults to those who laughed at their physiques then chenault organized a game in which each man gave a lesson to the others in what he knew best they had a high school biology lesson and instruction on how to drink threefifths of whisky without getting sick for jasons benefit there was a demonstration on how to plow a mule in turn jason described advanced techniques for shoveling snow but despite their diversions the full force of the heating system made itself felt the cell became stifling and the only relief was the rush of air which came from flushing the toilet around eleven oclock although it seemed to jason that it must be evening the guard returned getting kinda hot in there maybe you all should come outside to the field cooler out there no one answered but out of the comer of his eye jason saw willie c lightly nodding his head seeming to agree with the guard the guard noticed this too and centered his attention on willie you mighty young to be in here with these bad niggers boy you traveling in company that gonna get you in real trouble why dont you come on out and work some wont give you no hard job let you be the water boy here have a cigarette jason stared in miserable fascination as the cigarette was proferred when willie reached out his hand jason spoke up dont take it willie we agreed we wouldnt have anything to do with these guards the guard smiled at the rift you gonna let this new york nigger tell you what to do he just using you for his own plan he dont care nothing bout you here have some but willie had been shaken by the reprimand he lowered his head humph the guard snorted as he left      jason saw the disapproval in chenaults eyes as he studied willie he must think this could become a serious split in the group so soon hope he can pull it back together placing himself in the open space by the toilet chenault sat down with his legs crossed under neath him and called to johnnie one of the older fellows let me use your dice johnnie i saw you put them in the corner when they came for the clothes johnnie handed over the dice hey ben chenault said lets shoot some craps ben showed his yellow illcaredfor teeth in a generous grin and came over to stand in front of chenault jason always enjoyed ben especially at times like this when he put on his mock stance of authority one blacknailed foot jutting forward his hands spread out before him like fans and his big black stomach protruding out over the white shorts his huge eyes glittered round the cell capturing the attention of the other prisoners for whom the coming exchange was designed he peered down at chenault and affected a lisp nigger you knows you cant shoot no crapths i thought i taught you a lesson bout dat last mont at the staff meetink ben is a smart cat putting on that lisp to accentuate the difference between his ninthgrade education and chenaults graduate degree must know it helps the other fellows to identify with him chenault smiled up at ben you took my money last time but i had been drinking a little ben slapped his stomach and rubbed his hands together well he said you axed for it he came down on one knee pulled his own  dice from the waistband of his shorts and cast them onto the cement floor they began to play with ben using his own loaded dice to set the pattern of the game he would allow chenault to win would beat him mercilessly and then would woo him back into the competition by allowing him to win again the mood of the spectators bore an inverse relationship to chenaults success in the game when chenault was winning they were quiet and pensive when he was losing they were loud and playful joking about how hot it was in the cell and how mad the guard had been yesterday all around jason fellows were proudly chiding ben for cheating chenault out of his money though the mood became so easy that even willie c joined in the catcalls still no one spoke directly to chenault they joked to one another about him referring to his grand theories and to his disinterest in underwear but he remained essentially offlimits jason noticed that although no one spoke to chenault everyones gaze was directed at his kneeling figure they really want to get at chenault must be feeling some resentment at him for leading them into this mess matter of fact if  hadnt listened to him  wouldnt be stuck in this ugly place why dont they go on and laugh at him thats what he wants well  dont mind getting on him got a few bones to pick myself man jason said to chenault if you cant play any better why dont you get the hell out of the game you know you aint good for nothing but thinking  chenault responded immediately jason i know you aint talking to me why i picked you up out of the card room at harvard and made a man out of you if it hadnt been for me youd a been playing rummy for matchsticks with a bunch of lazy students right now grinning jason retorted you made something out of me man if i hadnt been around to keep you out of trouble youd a been dead right now just remember back to the time when you let the staff leave you on the drew plantation without even a car to get away said we should depend more on the people if i hadnt come and gotten you you would have been buried under that sharecroppers shack and the man still wouldnt have been registered to vote humph talking about all youve done for me you cant hardly take care of yourself jason turned to the others do you all remember when miss suzie mae was after him everyone laughed yes rev johnson he asked how did chenault get that scar on his shoulder and having opened the way for the others jason leaned back on the bunk rev johnson answered in his best pulpit manner well way i remember the thing miss suzie mae had been chasing after chenault here for a long time she used to come over to the office and fix food and clean up for all of us just so she could be round chenault she be there sometime at six oclock in the morning and stay all day someone interrupted shouting out you forgot to say how big she was oh yes rev johnson said she was twice as big as chenault could pick him up if she wanted to wasnt bad looking didnt have much hair on her head but still she looked all right had a husband that worked on the railroad anyway shed come over all the time and chenault would try to give her stuff to do to keep her busy he was shamed to have her cleaning up for him and all so hed send her canvassing give her books to look at everything yall remember when he tried to teach her how to type she couldnt hardly read and he was gonna make her into a secretary put her in front of the typewriter told her he knew she could do it and said type course she didnt never learn to type but she always acted like she was trying hard a least for as long as she could keep her mind off chenault well he tried his best to keep her busy but she always would come and say she was through a half hour after he give her something to do and she just kept trying to get him to bed with her affirmation from the others yeah thats right she sure kept after him rev johnson went on after bout two months of this chenault started getting weak i remember he started to giving her a job to do and then going out the back door so she wouldnt have no excuse for not doing it but she would catch him in an hour cause she knowed everywhere he could go in that little town so finally he just gave up and let her take him home rev johnson swelled up on his toes bent his back and hollowed his shoulders all the while he was spreading out his arms so that to jason he looked like a great eagle when he had reached his full expanse he clapped his hands together sharply hah and then do you know what happened enraptured cries now you coming to the best part what happened next reverend tell it like it is and fleeting glances at chenault to assure that he was not angry well time chenault and miss suzie mae got in bed time they got they business done and had got off to sleep her husband come slam ming through the door home from the railroad cheers slapping of knees laughter chenault jumped outta the bed and went through the window miss suzie maes husband come on after him with his gun and grazed him right there in the shoulder and you all know chenault dont wear no underwearand didnt have time to put on no pants all naked like that he couldnt even stop nowhere and ask for no help had to run all the way back to the freedom house and we got him out of town that night now satisfaction and remarks to prolong the story yeah thats sure how it happened man when i saw chenault sitting up at the house all naked and mad as he could be i laughed so hard it hurt and then to chenault chenault why you wait so long til her husband was ready to come home fore you got you some ass his head tilted back and his green eyes sparkling chenault answered i was afraid he was going to come followed by more gushing spluttering laughter which finally subsided into a general atmosphere of relaxation now a reservoir of unacknowledged emotions was released jason heard his own fears echoed by the others he too was worried that they might have to serve their full fiveyear sentences and he had begun to doubt that the workers on the outside would get the   bond he had become afraid that he could not last long without food hearing the others and reassuring them that things would work out he began to feel better himself it even seemed a little cooler in the cell the crap game having served its function ben returned the dice to his waistband and announced chenaults debt of  chenault admitted defeat as he stood willie c called to him chenault what made you think you could teach miss suzie mae how to keep the office and type and all willie i guess i just thought i could do it i thought she had talent that shed never had a chance to use before and that i could give her the chance to develop it and do you still think that yes       the days thereafter assumed a common pattern jason suffocated in the heat during the day and in the cold night he shivered for hours and berated himself for having willingly come to this filthy place it would be late in the night before he could sufficiently exhaust his mind and body so that he could finally drop off to sleep then at five the next morning an hour or so after hed gone to sleep he would be awakened by the guards demand that they go out to the field to work daily the prisoners refused to work the guard would then announce that they would get no food and would stomp out of the cell block followed by the young trusty with the armload of striped clothing as the days passed the guard demanded more intensely and angrily that they go to work but they continued to refuse in the mornings having been completely aroused by the confrontation with the guard jason would give up his efforts to sleep and would drag himself over to wash his face he would join in the exercises and singing and the games and would lapse at times into a fitful sleep through it all he was encouraged by watching chenault who seemed to be thriving in the dark musty cell he was awake and washed before the guard came banging on the bars he would rout out the others and would laugh and talk with them throughout the day he seemed to be tuned in on the moods of the other prisoners when jason himself became irritable and depressed it was chenault who appeared next to him on the bunk reminding him of an eccentric teacher they had had in college or sharing with him his plan for the movements growth in mississippi chenault confided to him in these discussions that he had found his lifes work in the civil_rights struggle if the movement succeeded his life would have been well spent if not it would have been wasted for him every demonstration every confrontation with the whites was intensely important because jason realized how important it was to chenault that they emerge from the jail as an unbroken group he would set aside his depression and would try once more to talk and joke with the others for four days the group bore the discomfort and the hunger with only a minimum of prodding and encouragement but on the fifth day some began to weaken and with the weakness came insecurity and fear there were arguments in which some battered against the logic or refusing to work and to eat a few began to fight over who should play with the dice or who should have to sleep on the floor instead of ignoring the guard when he came around some began to whisper stealthily with him worst among these was willie c three times in one day jason saw fellows pulling willie c back from the bars so that he could not whisper with the guard when this happened the guard cackled happily and sauntered out of the cell block c c c c c on the seventh night of the fasting jason was surprised by the familiar nasal voice of the guard he did not usually come to harass them late at night he unlocked the door and intruded his massive body into the cell willie c his voice twanged i got something for you want you to come on with me  jason watched unbelieving as willie c slowly rose from the bunk he grabbed the boys arm to restrain him but willie c shook loose and followed the guard from the cell amid the curses of the other prisoners jason struggled to understand willies action why would the boy do a thing like that c c c  sje the next morning willie c was installed in the empty cell across from them the young trusty brought him a mattress blankets cigarettes tobacco candy and a tin of food while the guard watched willie c climbed into the striped uniform after the guard left willie c tried to talk with ben hey ben them guards aint so bad they didnt hurt me none just talked to me a while and give me all these things look i got a mattress and this salt meat dont taste bad after a week of nothing but water ben surveyed the faces of the others hes trying to decide how to treat willie everyone but chenault seems to have frozen up guess that means theyre going to ignore willie c dont know much about this kind of thing myself better watch chenault follow his lead nervously breaking the silence willie c offered some of his new possessions hey yall want some candy how bout some tobacco i got cigarettes and tobacco cause i knowed yaild want some ben i knows you likes to smoke here catch he threw the can of tobacco and a package of wrapping papers across the aisle ben did not reach out to catch them and they fell just short of the cell ben willie c implored they right in front a you pick them up thats a lot of tobacco ben announced i dont want nothing from you and turned his back to the boy chenault came to the front of the cell his eyes moved methodically to willie c to the other prisoners and back to willie c lets talk more about this he said hmm thats odd normally hed let the fellows fight something like this out among themselves wouldnt step in the middle of it like that must really be worried that the group will fall apart this time its silly to try and ignore willie vhen hes right across the aisle from us chenault continued why do you think the guard put him there no weve got to work this thing out ben said aint nothing to work out he rather do what white folks tell him its all right with us but we aint gonna have nothing to do with him but ben chenault said maybe willie didnt really do anything bad looking into willies unhappy eyes he asked besides taking the mattress and stuff from them did you do anything else willie what did you talk to them about last night willie c at first evaded chenaults question mumbling and pulling nervously at his blanket his silence was met by the derision of the others hes so dumb he tole them everything he know and in falsetto voice willie did you tell them how much you love white folks probably gave them some ass while he was at it with each accusation jason saw the anger rise further in willie c trembling he flung himself against the bars just had to fuck with me didnt you he shouted alright i tell you what i did i signed a goddam statement that chenault was corrupting the morals of a youth by convincing me to demonstrate and get put in jail when i didnt want to do it now laugh bout that laugh bout the  years chenault can get for that how could he do that to chenault thats a hard charge to beat chenault might have to serve those  years what could be on willies mind chenault must be furious chenaults manner did not change he spoke softly thats rough willie but we can get the lawyers to work on it when we get out what worries me is why you did it try to explain ii just dont understand willie c answered  cause i was hungry and he that guard say some things last night that was true and he told me i just had to go long with him and i could have some food and a mattress and all chenault said what could he possibly have said that was true willie well like he say bout i dont have no say over what we gonna do just always do what you tell me say yall just using me using you how could you think that willie what have we ever used you for you know last year the machine    willie answered machine what machine last yearthat was before i came chenault had turned to ben in apparent confusion ben whats willie talking about i dont remember any machine jason could feel a discomfort among the others they shifted their positions and stared hard at the floor what could be so bad about a machine why are they so emm barrassed rev johnson said maybe explain some other time ben after we get out of here goddamit johnson ben said  its time for chenault to know if he always want to know everything he got to take the bad with the good now do you want to tell him or you want me to do it well rev johnson said i guess its better for me to tell it chenault willies talking about that time last year when you tole him you was gonna make him the project director to take your place you remember you and him was running round buying him a desk to keep his papers in and you was introducing him to the people from the north who was raising money for the project so he would have contact with all the resources you gave him books to read and youd sit next to him at dinner so you could talk to him bout the books and bout how things should go when he took over afraid you got him all excited bout how important he was gonna be you remember now of course i remember that chenault said but what did it have to do with any machine chenault ben said you supposed to be so smart but you dont see nothing plain and simple you found out it was too hard you found out you couldnt give willie eight years of education in two months he couldnt do research on the power structure of the state til he learned how to write he couldnt follow your logic cause his mind didnt work that way and you cut his ass loose you put him in the back of the office in the storeroom gave him a tube of ink and made him the director of the mimeograph machine and you made it worse by telling him that running that silly machine all day was very important for the movement had everybody tipping round trying to make him feel better by asking him to please make them a hundred copies of something had them tipping round like that when everybody knew that he had flunked out everybody knew willie wasnt shit thats what the fuck he was talking bout oh no poor chenault so willie cracked because of him in the painful silence chenault closed his eyes and slowly nodded his head how could he make such a mistake and willie he must have been miserable to have hoped for so much and ended up with a mimeograph machine chenault spoke haltingly his old air of competence gone now thats aa problem ill have to work on i must have misunderstood last year but the problem the problem for all of us now is willie hes only seventeen seventeen we cant expect him to think like we do and im afraid its clear now that he had some cause to do what he did maybe it was my fault i accept   the responsibility for his actions thats foolish ben said you cant take the blame for willie hes a man been doing a mans work since he was fourteen and he got to pay for his mistakes like anybody else chenault could not answer covering his eyes with his hands he withdrew into the shadows of the cell for the rest of the day the prisoners argued over willie c chenault said nothing he only sat balled up on the floor rocking back and forth when some of them began to drop off to sleep jason came over and sat down on the floor next to chenault he felt bound to share chenaults miseryas if sharing it helped knowing no words he could only stare into chenaults brooding face sometimes catching his eye and trying to smile at times he would clasp chenaults shoulder and then he would be shot through with the thousands of tiny vibrations which racked his friends body he welcomed the darkness and the dulling whir of the fans      late in the night jason heard an unfamiliar sound over the noise of the fans next to him chenault raised his head he too had heard the sound it was willie c crying chenault breathed oh no and he shrank back against the wall pushing himself into the stone away from the sound as jason sat helplessly search ing for a way to relieve his friend he heard voices above him he distinguished the soft voices of rev johnson and two of the younger fellows they called across the aisle willie hey willie what you doing over there didnt know you was woke man you aint crying is you willie aint nothing to cry bout boy we have you outta there in no time make that fat guard so mad he throw you back in here with us bad niggers nothing to worry bout and bens deep bass voice saying throw over some a them cigarettes man folks over here wants to smoke
