there has never been t a free people a free country a real democracy on the face of this earth in a city of some   slaves and  socalled free men plato sat down and praised freedom in exquisitely elegant phrases in a colony of  slaves and thousands of white indentured servants thomas jefferson a wealthy slaveowner sat down and wrote the memorable words of the declaration of independence in a country with  million secondclass citizens and millions on millions of povertystricken whites woodrow wilson segregated the toilets in washington d c and went forth to make the world safe for democracy there has never been a free people a free country a real democracy in the recorded history of man the great masses of men have always lived in suburbs of hell the great masses of men and almost all women have always been anvils for the hammers of the few we have gathered therefore to talk about a subject which has no past insofar as mankind is concerned and which can have no future unless it is visualized and made concrete in the body of mankind and it seems to me that one forfeits the right to talk about freedom unless one is prepared to face that fact and to do something about it almost  years ago at a time of revolutionary turbulence not unlike the present tom pane held that unpalatable tfruth up to the unseeing»eyes of his contemporaries freedom he sid hath been hunted aribund the globe    cd receive the fugitive and prepare in time an asylum for mankind today after a thousand evasions after a thousand proclamations and manifestoes freedom is still a fugitivein america as well as in russia in portugal as well as in angola in england as well as in rhodesia in boston as well as in mississippi we live in a world where twothirds of the people are hungry we live in a world where most of the peoples are diseased and illiterate in such a world who has the effronterywho has the gallto praise the state of freedom the whole problem of freedom in the white and nonwhite worlds must be placed first in this larger context for henceforth it will be impossible to speak of freedom in terms of the concerns of the tiny minority of men who live in europe and north america we must note moreover that freedom in western europe and north america is abstract negative and largely illusory and even in these areas millions live on the edge of despair and millions more are slaves to their skin or to their omnivorous machines it will be my argument here that the truth of freedom in the world is the truth of the truly disinherited and by that i mean that the state of freedom is most accurately reflected in the lives of the men on the bottom the men on the top and the men in the middle can remain ignorant of what they do and of what they are but the men on the bottom experience the truth of society irremediably they are the truth of every society in them we can see what we are and what we have become in the mirror of their eyes we can measure the depth of our alienation from freedom and from man to be even more explicit and to bring the matter closer to home i intend to maintain here that racism is the best index of the failure of american society to create a human and equitable society for white people my argument here is the very simple one that the depth of racism is a measure of the unfreedom in the white community and from that premise we can conclude that black men are not free because white men are not free and by all this we must understand that when the emancipation proclamation finally comes it will be most of all an emancipation of white people from the fears and frailties that cruelly twist and goad their lives before pursuing that argument let us pause for a moment and examine the meaning and implications of the word that everybody praises and few people live as we all know freedom lends itself to numerous interpretations in the white western world it is usually defined negatively as freedom from this definition finds its truth in certain abstract liberties freedom of speech freedom of association et cetera to define freedom thusly and to stop there is in my opinion a perversion of freedom for freedom also means freedom to and this positive definition finds its truth in concrete possibilities created in the social field in the right to work in the right to eat in the right to shelter in the right to be there is still another definition of freedom a psychological one which stresses the act of willing or choosing and this definition in turn is linked to a fourth one which contends that manby his ability to rise above or transcend a situation any situation by his ability to say no is the measure and the meaning of freedom in the world in my opinion no definition of freedom is adequate in todays world which does not embrace all these meaningsfreedom from freedom to transcendencein a concrete context linked to conditions that open or close real possibilities to concrete men in their social and historical situation such a definition would recognize the existentialist truth that man is freedom and would recognize that the alienation of the world from freedom is a measure of its alienation from man and the possibilities of man it would also recognize the truth that man has not yet been created and that the creation of manblack man as well as white manawaits the winning of real concrete freedom for all men here and there across the great wastelands of time little knots of men have glimpsed the terrifying possibilities of that paradox i think particularly of african village democracy and other free forms developed by american indians and other communal groups but these groups were hemmed in by material limitations and it was left to western europe to free man from feudal restrictions and to hoist high the standards of individuality and personal autonomy but europe in its lunge toward freedom made three fatal errors first of all and most important of all europe experienced its newfound freedom as the untrammelled exercise of the ego and in pursuit of the goal of possessive individualism it drew a circle around itself excluding and enslaving threefourths of mankind second out of sheer terror europe cut freedom into two parts separating man into positive and negative poles the mind and the body reason and emotion sex and the soul refusing to recognize the full force of freedom which manifests itself in sex as well as in prayer europe facilitated that manic process by which men project their rejected freedom onto the scapegoats and outcasts of society  in the third place europe refused to admit the full logic of its own idea with few exceptions europeans and the sons of europeans found it difficult to extend the idea of freedom to poor whites and impossible to extend it to nonwhites in europe and in the extensions of europe freedom became a function of the skin and of property despite the huge achievements of european technology and science european freedom beautiful as it was was not freedom or better still it was not yet freedom having freed man from arbitrary restraints europe stopped halfway leaving man tied to the chains of caste class and passion having expelled man from his tribal and feudal eden europe retreated in terror from nietzsches lucid question not free from what but free for what america inherited europes immense achievements and its immense failuresand extended both the history of america like the history of europe has been a history of a magnificent evasion of the multiple meanings of freedom the most obvious example of that failure is the black american but the failure to integrate black people into the american community is only a part of our cultures general inability to create a just and human environment despite our alleged affluence  to  million americans many of them white live in abject poverty and millions more live lives of harrowing economic insecurity despite our extraordinary mechanical ability which cannot be praised too highly we have failed to create a truly human community machines are more real here than human beingsand vastly more important in a society of machines by machines and for machines we are increasingly powerless and a nihilistic individualism has made conformistsand cowardsof us all dehumanized depersonalized distracted by bread and television we have almost lost sight of man mystified by an ethic which confuses the verb to be with the verb to have we try to staunch the running wound of our lives by adding layers and layers of mechanical bandaids we lack passion we lack purpose and we decide nothing the great alternatives are formulated by others and in our name and without our assent men women and little children are killed in povertystricken countries increasingly irresponsible as our choices become fewer and as the world becomes more threatening we whirl around and in a materialistic inferno between collective madness and collective selfdestruction and we are afraid we are afraid of our neighbors of negroes of chinese of communists of fourletter words sex fluoridationwe are afraid in a word of ourselves because we fear ourselves and others because we are dominated by machines and things because we are not in control of our destiny we are neither happy nor free if one probes beneath the chromeplated surface senator j w fulbright says he comes inescapably to the conclusion that the american people by and large are not happy  i believe    that americas trouble is basically one of aimlessness at home and frustration abroad as you have probably guessed by now i believe americas trouble is at a deeper level the problem in my opinion is structural that is institutional we have not created a single community here we have not even created a single community for white people men tell me that white people ought to love black people but it is clear to me that white people dont love each other not to speak of the fact that an incredibly large number of white americans dont love themselves racism in america is a reflection of this structural problem as i have said elsewhere we misunderstand racism completely if we do not see it as a confused and alienated protest against a suffocating reality on the level of power racism is used by men to effect magical solutions of the unresolved social problems in the white community on a personal level particularly among lowerincome and middleincome whites racism is an avenue of flight a cry for help from desperate men stifling in the prisons of their skins viewed in this perspective racism is a flight from freedom a flight from the self a flight from the intolerable burdens of being a man in a mechanized world there is considerable evidence that americas stress on possessive individualism induces exaggerated anxieties which are displaced onto the area of race relations the fear of failure the fear of competitors the fear of losing status of not living in the right neighborhood of not having the right friends or the right gadgets these fears weigh heavily on the minds of millions of americans and lead to a search for avenues on the escape and so the factory worker or the poor farmer who finds himself at a dead end with a nagging wife a problem child and a pastdue bill uses the black man as a screen to hide himself from himself and from an intolerable reality to adapt the perceptive words of richard wright social discontent assumes many guises and the social commentator who focuses on the police blotter misses the real clues to contemporary reality by this i mean that it is possible to know before it happens that certain forms of violence will occur it can be known before it happens that a native bom american educated healthy with a pretty wife a splitlevel house and two cars with all the abstract liberties but devoid of basic human satisfactions will seize upon a powerless black man and derive deep feelings of pleasure from hacking him to death with a chain but as wright said to know that a seemingly normal ordinary american is capable of such brutality implies making a judgment about the nature and quality of our everyday american experiences which most americans simply cannot do for to admit that our individual experiences are of so low a quality  as to preclude the deep organic satisfactions necessary for civilized peaceful living is to condemn the system that provides those experiences the real question in america is how we build a society in which apparently normal people do not need scapegoats or whipping boys to build their egos and to maintain their dignity how can we build a society that will enhance freedom and integrity and obviate the need for racism first of all we have to condemn the system and we have to condemn the system in the name of that america of that commonwealth of silence which was written which was promised and which has never existed i am suggesting here that we must initiate a sustained dialogue on the foundations of our society and we must demand the right to subject every institution to the claims of freedom let me say immediately that i dont have all the answers the only thing i know is that everything must be rethought again we need a new definition of work embracing any act of value that a man brings to society and a new definition of politics embracing the full and effective participation of all men in formulating the alternatives and choosing between the alternatives of the political economic and social decisions that affect their lives we also need a new definition of sex which would free women for equal roles in the church in labor unions in the professions and every other institution of our society i often say to my wife that women not negroes are the most brainwashed people in the western world of course in this regard i am very much like thomas jefferson i want women to have absolute freedom everywhere right nowbut i hope that the revolution starts with somebody elses wife but wherever the revolution starts i am prepared to welcome it for i believe that the future of freedom in america is dependent upon the formulation of a broader definition of freedom and of man and of woman than our society is based upon and it seems to me that it is necessary to set liberty in the context of equality with the understanding that every individual is entitled to the space and the chance to fulfill himself which is only another way of saying that every individual is entitled to the instruments that will permit him to go to the boundaries of himself this i believe is a precondition for black and white freedom in america for if we want black men and white men to cooperate we must create conditions that will make it possible for them to cooperate in other words we must change the conditions that lead white men to see black men as threats to their homes to their jobs to their masculinity and to do this we must modify the situation of the white man from top to bottom for to demand that white men give up their irrational responses to black reality is to demand that a situation which requires irrational responses be abolished we must conceive and organize in this country programs that will make it impossible for one man to profit by another mans fall we must conceive and organize in this community and in every other community programs that will relieve the economic pressures on all men so that some men will not find it to their shortterm economic interest to keep other men down in other words we must take the profit out of bigotry the first steps in this direction would be a guaranteed annual income the extension of medicare to all citizens the elimination of regressive taxes and housing and educational subsidies to lower and middleincome groups ultimately however such an effort would require a reevaluation of our dominant myths including the myth of possessive individuality which is the greatest single obstacle to individuality and the myth of property which is the greatest single obstacle to the free enjoyment of property by all men let there be no misunderstanding here i am not saying that property in itself is evilwhat im saying is that property masquerading as god is the major roadblock to freedom in the world today men need a certain amount of property to validate themselves and their freedom but freedom becomes unfreedom and life loses its meaning when property  becomes an inhuman idol when anything and everything is sacrificed to an abstract thing there was an interesting article on this subject in the new york post which i would like to quote at some length the article referred to the summer marches by dr martin_luther_king jr and his supporters through the gage park area of chicago peter hamill visited the neighborhood and wrote the following words this was the way the hollywood hustlers used to put their cardboard america together in a time more innocent than ours children played in the streets or burbled from baby carriages young boys mowed lawns which still smelled sweetly from the morning rains housewives pushed strollers to the grocery stores or drove the family cars to the supermarkets a man on vacation nailed a brass numeral to his front door a lot of people seemed to be polishing automobiles with an almost reverent devotion gage park on monday afternoon seemed as innocuous as anyplace where doris day had ever lived on film but underneath past the front doors of those twostory houses in the secret places behind those lawns and those automobiles and those smiling children gage park was like a tray of summer worms by the time the thing that is crawling through gage park has hooked its last inhabitant that neighborhood is almost certainly going to murder someone it is going to murder someone because of the accident of color it is going to murder someone over the combination of wood metal and concrete which the inhabitants fondly describe as their property the same animal is crawling through the gage parks of boston and new york and california and if we dont confront it soon an unspeakably horrible disaster is going to happen here its going to happen because our churches and schools have not taught people that no thing is higher than man its going to happen because our civilization has not yet learned that men are important whether they own property or not to a great extent racism in america is grounded on the whole sick syndrome surrounding real estate status greed and human pettiness if we are serious about freedom we are going to have to come to grips with that syndrome we hear a great deal about freedom and property but we must have the courage to say that words cannot be prostituted with impunity freedom is a fine word but it has its boundaries men who say the community is free when it is enslaved men who say the sky is black when it is blue are debasing reality and preparing the way for tyranny we can respect freedom only when it is intended for freedom a freedom that denies freedom must be denied in the name of freedom for to be free is not to have the power to do anything you want to do i am oppressed if i am denied the right of free movement but i am not oppressed if i am denied the right to deny my neighbor freedom of movement beyond all that we must note that the idea of oneclass onekind neighborhoods is in and of itself a clear and present danger to american democracy the standardized neighborhoods the standardized houses the standardized minds and the standardized fears which stretch from one end of america to another is a denial of the movement of life which advances by integrating differences as chardin has said joy lies not in exclusiveness and isolation but in variety which is the reservoir of experience and emotion on the other hand uniformity sameness standardization make for cultural stagnation and as sure as night follows day regimentation and eventually neofascism in order to deal with the antidemocratic ideas which have made deep inroads in american life we must make revolutionary changes at every level of our lives we confront in a word the need for not a law here or a law there but for a vital change in the whole spirit of our civilization ah signs indicate that we are moving toward a critical point in american history the rise of the radical right the deepening despair in the ghetto the deepening fear in the white community the explicit avowals of apartheid in the recent elections all these bespeak the seriousness of the moment this is an important moment in the history of the commonwealth there stretch out before us now two roads and two roads only america must now become america or something else a fourth reich perhaps or a fourth reich of the spirit to put the matter bluntlywe must become what we say we are or give in to the secret dream that blights our hearts let us rejoice that it has come to this now that freedom is dangerous perhaps men will stop prostituting it now that freedom is exploding in broad open daylight in the streets of america and vietnam perhaps we will be able to recognize her true friends as individuals we are called upon to make a creative response to this challenge by assuming our own freedom and validating it in social acts designed to create spaces in which the seeds of freedom can grow in a very real sense the struggle in america is a struggle to free white americans or to be quite precise it is a struggle to put them in the presence of their freedom and it seems to me that it is the duty of this convocation to send abroad the good news that one can be free even in boston or chicago or new york freedom isnt something you can buy on the installment plan it is not a gift from anybodyit is a priceless possession that must be reclaimed and rewon every day as silone has said one can be free even under a dictatorship all you have to do is to struggle against it he who thinks with his own head and acts with his own heart is free he who is not afraid of his neighbors is free he who struggles for what he believes in is a free man on the other hand if you live in the richest boston suburb and if you are lazy timid conformist you are not free but a slave because men deny the tiny bit of psychological freedom at their disposal it is necessary to awaken them by social movements in which wills confront each other this is the meaning of the black revolution which is inviting us to become ourselves by going to the limits of ourselves this revolution defines the state of freedom in america today and it tells us that freedom has no future in america if the black man does not have a future in freedom more than  years ago walt whitman told ralph waldo emerson master i am a man who has perfect faith but master we have not come through centuries caste heroism fables to halt in this land today the spirit of walt whitman is marching today in the harlems of our mind men and women made in whitmans image are saying to us fellow americans we have perfect faith but fellow americans we have not come through slavery segregation degradation blood cotton roaches rats to halt in this land today black americans by daring to claim their freedom are daring us to claim our own and the movement which expresses that thrust will continue despite the recent revelations of the depth and extent of racism in america whatever the problems whatever the setbacks whatever the dangers oppression must be rejected at any cost for as du bois said the price of freedom is always less than the cost of oppression in the black revolution america comes hard up against a new fact the color of the world has changed and with that change a terrifying freedom has become the burden of all men especially those men who were tyrannized for so long by the arbitrary limitations of their skin if white men come forward now to claim their own freedom and individuality if they abandon their trenches and come out into the open america will become the america that was dreamedthis is the real meaning of the black revolution which is a desperate attempt to place before our freedom the burning alternatives history is offering us walt whitman said we have not come through centuries caste fables to halt in this land today black americans are saying we have not come through slavery segregation degradation to halt in this land today and the question now is what do you say
while returning from a v otorr v trip to washington revv £ centty i took my family to visit shasta dam j was doubtful that the s visit would provide anything of interest but the view from the top of the dam was impressive looking down the appearance of the men and machines testified to the unlimited ability of american technology in the distance the men appeared to be midgets and pipes were like strands of rope then we toured the dam and eventually reached the bottom looking up i was amazed at how little the view from the top told me about the dam what seemed small from the top appeared to be overwhelming from the bottom the pipes were not like strands of rope they were large enough for a greyhound bus to pass through from the top the bottom looked far away but rather easily reached one could always fall from the bottom the top looked even further away and impossible to reach i know now that i can never visit another dam and fully appreciate it unless i see it from the top and the bottom for anything less only provides a distorted impression of the structure education at cal the university of california at berkeley has brought me into contact with many wonderful people i would have never met had my life stopped with the menial job i thought was going to be my future many of these people feellooking down from the topthat the problems facing the negro are minute when compared with all of american progress having lived the experience of the negro i know that the problems are fantastically huge huge beyond ones ability to translate into mere words i find myself filled with an intense desire to tell people what is really happening but these efforts usually end in failure because the people have neither looked up from the bottom nor have they ever been on the bottom to see what the overall situation actually looks like the racism of america becomes apparent in this process of growing awareness americas hypocrisy becomes even more real we are taught the values the beliefs the words which are supposed to characterize america long before we have reached the age of mature criticism and when we come to an understanding of america it is not in terms of these beliefs but in terms of the practices and their implications are apparent even in the liberal confines of the university of california two of the areas where i had  painful experiences with the hypocrisy and racism of america were in contact with students and administrators as a teaching assistant i spent many hours in my office talking with students they would tell me much and sometimes too much for their remarks would leave me in a rage against all that they represent a sorority member asked for a special appointment so we could discuss the term paper which she was writing in the course of our conversation she began talking about her attitude toward the girls going through rush and her basis for voting against some of them she was in the sorority for one reason it was a way to gain prestige anyone who could not add to the prestige of her sorority was going to be refused membership a negro has no prestige in america so any negro girl who came to her house during rush season would be refused it was as simple as that during the conversation she referred to the international house the residence of many foreign students as the zoo other students tell me about the schemes they use to avoid the draft graduate school letters from relatives who are also doctors faking hearing defects and the like i think of the high proportion of negroes in vietnam the high proportion of negro dead and wounded in vietnam and i realize that these people still need the negro to do their dirty work so that they can continue to lead their lives of jaded comfort cal has had good administrators but far too few of them in the spring of  when i was president of the campus naacp we asked permission to invite malcolm_x to speak our application went in to the dean permission was granted and pauley ballroom was reserved for the occasion in the meantime we protested to the chancellor about an employer coming to interview in the campus placement center because we had evidence that this employer had systematically discriminated against negroes for certain positions we got no reply from the chancellor so on the morning of the employers visit a small group picketed the placement center that afternoon i received a call saying that permission for malcolm_x to speak had been rescinded because he was a religious speaker and campus facilities could not be used by such persons the next day the daily california announced bishop pike was to speak in wheeler auditorium in an attempt to salvage our program i went to the chancellors office and spoke to one of his top aides this man told me that he had issued the order to cancel malcolms appearance and he alone was responsible for the decision when i protested about bishop pike i was told that pike was a theologian but malcolm was a religious speaker it occurred to me that the man to whom i was speaking was not responsible for student affairs yet he had made the decision about student affairs i then told him i considered this to be an arbitrary decision made against us because we were negroes he turned red protesting that some of his best friends were negroes he actually said it and went on to tell me about the negro who always came to his home and played with his son i believe now and i have always believed that the cancellation of malcolm_x as a speaker was a step taken to punish us for picketing the placement center when the asuc invited malcolm_x to the campus in the fall of  malcolm refused of course i was further convinced of the wholly punitive nature of the earlier action that is unless i was ready to accept the idea that in this period of time malcolm became a theologian and not a religious speaker this was my first real encounter with that monolith called the power structure and i was badly stung you look at them with their cold blue eyes and their hard faces and you realize that they have the power and you have the skin since that time i have come to a fuller understanding of how much the power structure is a replica of the racism in americanot so much in its pronouncements as in its practices throughout the university you find evidence of it negroes speak openly of it but the whites are blind to it because they have never stood at the bottom of the hill and do not know how much they reflect this racism you remember the key examples the negro secretary who was fired because she struck a white worker who called her a nigger the food services worker who was fired because he ostensibly refused to bring a note from his doctor explaining his absence from work the papers explaining his dismissal make no mention of the fact that he belonged to a religious group which did not believe in going to doctors the negro administrator who was dismissed as incompatible because he openly objected to his supervisors racial slurs another supervisor had complained that he was not submissive enough the golden bear restaurant which has never sullied its appearance with a negro waitress and of course they claim that no negroes apply negro girls admit they do not want to go through the pain of applying when they know they will not be hired we know that the personnel staff there have a practice of hiring from a waiting list of names suggested by other waitresses so it is a closed system of whites only most enraging of all the practices of the power structure are the attempts to get more negro athletes into cal for years i have talked with alumni and administrators  who were interested in getting more negro athletes into cal but who expressed no interest in the negroes who were only interested in cals academic offerings these men feel that if they could draw more heavily on the negro athletes in the state then cal might once again rise to prominence in sports but the view from the bottom of the hill indicates that negroes need more educated people much more than we need athletes when these people come and express interest in the negro you soon become aware that they are not at all interested in negroes they are interested in cal sports and if they can use negroes to get to the top they will do so without offering the athletes very much anyone heard of john erby lately my reaction to these men has always been similar to my reaction to the draftdodger one young negro expressed it this way to me one afternoon in the bears lair all these cats are saying to us is to go out and find them some strong niggers that was how he felt about it then that is how i have always felt about it similar experiences take place in the classrooms you study and learn about america and in the process you learn how to analyze the situation and come to a fuller understanding of all the dimensions of americas treatment of the negro you learn how negro children are taught to dream the american dream at such early age and so effectively that by the time they come to the awareness that this dream does not include them they are unable to carry that awareness to its logical conclusion and destroy both the dream and its teacher we are even taught that this conclusion is irrational but the situation of the black man in this country is so irrational that only irrational acts will save us you learnin your objective search for truththat white america accrues gains from racism and discrimination although people use you as an example of what the negro can do you acquire objective evidence that the overwhelming majority of negroes see little change in their life conditions for example the sociologist from the university of texas who analyzed the rates at which negroes were overtaking whites in their struggle for equal treatment and then extrapolated these rates to see how long from  it would take the negro to reach full equality the answer at the  rates of change it would take  years in education  years in occupation  years in income of persons and  years in family income and you get angry other professors even in their attempts to be kind and helpful reflect the hypocrisy and insidious racism of this country the professors who gave their time and ability to the analysis of public school history textbooks and found that they were remiss in their treatment of the negro and other mi norities yet they do not find it possible to inaugurate a course in the history of american minorities which would help to correct a very bad situation the professor who writes an introduction to a paperback version of a classic study of the negro family but includes twice a subtle but vicious insult to negroes and you ask yourself how deep does this go can it ever end and you get angrier my experience as a negro at cal has been one of moving through an intellectual microcosm of america the experience has been pregnant with promise but the promise is dimmed by the actualities you see all around you the agonizing thing about it is that they want you to adjust to this system and become a part of it you know that both the draftdodger and the football rooter are building their comfort and ease on the shoulders of the black man shoulders which have boosted this country since  but after a goal is reached they always stick a knife into the heart of the burdenbearer the negro soldier who died in vietnam but who could not be buried in the cemetery in his hometown  they want you to adjust to this and help them to avoid the draft help them to find negro athletes and you know if you do this you will only perpetuate their exploitation of the people of your birth and heritage so you protest you tell them that it isnt fair and they must be much more equitable in their dealings with youeither serve with the black man or get the black man out of vietnam just as they keep themselves out of vietnam either forget about black athletes or seek black scholars as diligently as they seek black athletes and they look at you with a dumb look you arent the negro they know you dont smile at them you dont scratch your head and shuffle your feet you dont come to their dinners at the faculty club smoke their big cigars and help them develop ways to continue their exploitation of the negro not knowing how to deal with an unsubmissive negro they cancel your speakers have you dismissed from your job they make it plain that either you play their game and do so the way they want it played or you will suffer this is the agony the wretchedness of the black man who stands at the top of the hill and looks down remembering how it was to look up and knowing what it is like down there if you adjust to their evil system you will enjoy some of its fruits but they are bitter fruits for they are based on the practice of keeping other blacks at the bottom of the hill if you fight their evil system they will use their power to silence you either path is an agonizing one but if you re member the shining example of brother malcolm he was not afraid to die because he loved us so the choice is easy knowing that you will always be considered an ingrate the agony turns to rage i cheered the fsm free student movement but did not join because i have sworn to myself that if any policeman ever lays his hands on me then either he or i must die right there i have found that there were times when i longed not for more blacks on the uc football team but that the team would lose more games i remember sitting before the tv set last year and cheering each time a building in watts erupted into flames all this in an attempt to avoid the insanity that comes from adjusting to and thereby accepting americas exploitation of the black man and the uc version of that exploitation all this to avoid the insanity that comes from thinking that one has really made it as a negro when all around you are friends relatives and others the folk who will not be permitted to make it because they are negro the view from the top is so distorting and the view from the bottom so overwhelming that i wonder if america will ever conceive and undertake the steps necessary to bring full justice to the negro the more i study the more i realize how unlikely this will be so i long for even more drastic steps perhaps someday we blacks will become fully cognizant of the situation perhaps the brothers in vietnam will one day realize that they have been shooting at the wrong enemy and turn those weapons toward their true enemies perhaps the brothers in all the ghettos will one day realize that we should not just have cheered watts we should have joined them at the same time in our own cities there wouldnt be enough national guard to handle that one then the power structure will move again and we will be utterly crushed but it is more palatable than this living death brotherslet us remember malcolmit is better to die on your feet than live on your knees
for nearly  years a philip randolph has been a leader in the fight for full citizenship rights for black americans he is today the elder statesman of afroamerican labor leaders his credentials now read father of the historic  march on washington president negro american labor council lone negro member of the executive council of aflcio international president of the brotherhood of sleeping car porters he proposed the first civil_rights march on washington in   which resulted in president roosevelts famous executive order  creating the presidents fair employment practice committee these accomplishments are not unrelated to his earlier years when he was a young radical with only a small number of followersand was being called by some newspapers and police authorities the most dangerous negro in the united states he was born in  in a rural town near jacksonville florida at a time when the deep south was perfecting the combination of negro disfranchisement and violence which would keep white supremacy unbroken for the next  years his father was a respected minister of the militant african methodist episcopal church this was young randolphs first teacher and his first exposure to radical thought the elder randolph preached to his son the subversive doctrine that race was a distinction without significancethat god himself was neither black nor whitethat a mans quality not his color was what mattered his family convinced him that education was the key to whatsoever future success he hoped for young philip and his brother attended cookman institute in jacksonville florida with tuition money they had earned themselves after finishing high school he left the south and continued his education inspired by his father with a feeling for the spoken word randolph showed an early interest in acting particularly shakespearean drama following his marriage to lucille e green former virginia school teacher in  he helped organize the shakespearean society in harlem playing the roles of hamlet othello and romeo but randolphs widely admired eloquence soon took him from the dramatic stage to the leaders platform his first experience with the cause of negro labor came shortly after he left ccny and took a job with the fall river line in attempting to organize the steamship companys waiters randolph was summarily fired meanwhile he had read extensively in philosophy economics and political science developing an interest in the socialist party of eugene victor debs which he eventually joined then in  under the influence of the sociologist lester ward he and chandler owen founded the messenger avowing itself the only radical magazine in america this socialist publication has been regarded by scholars as among the most brilliantly edited ventures in negro journalism in addition to militantly championing negro rights the messenger spoke out on other issues thus in  while speaking in cleveland against american participation in world war i randolph was arrested and later described by the lust committee forerunner of the dies committee as the most dangerous negro in americaa charge often repeated down the years by opponents of negro rights in  at the request of milton webster t t paterson and ashley totten randolph undertook leadership of the campaign to organize the brotherhood of sleeping car porters this uphill battle marked by fierce resistance from the railway companies and the vicissitudes of the depression was finally won in  when the bscp won certification meanwhile in  the messenger became the black worker the official publication of the sleeping car porters the brotherhood of sleeping car porters came into existence at a time when american trade unions including those in the railroad industry were losing members among other reasons for this decrease in membership was an aggressive labor policy of a large number of businesses the pullman company was experiencing a decrease in net income which alone was enough to make it more aggressive in its antiunion policies although this was an unfavorable period in which to start a labor union especially in an antiunion stronghold the porters forged ahead with their organizing activities one advantage which the brotherhood had from its beginning was that its leader was not employed by the pullman company nor had randolph ever been a porter the pullman company referred to him as an outside agitator and questioned his fitness to lead the porters in their effort to improve their lot to this question randolph referred his opponents to a decision of the united states railroad labor board which sanctioned the right of employees to choose as their representatives persons not employed by the company randolph was at this time already a keen student of labor economics and philosophy he had studied at the college of the city of new york and had lectured at the rand school of social science in new york city he had become interested in labor unions as an instrument of socialism  the railroads were one of the three largest employers of negro labor in the nation almost twothirds of the railroads negro workers were laborers and the highest job to which a negro could reasonably hope to aspire was that of pullman car porter but to negroes it was a job to aspire to porters travelled saw the country served the best white society for the travelling public the sleeping car porter was part of the romance of the railroad the public didnt know of course that the major railroad brotherhoods rigidly excluded negroes from better jobs or that porters were forced to provide their own uniforms and buy the very polish with which they shined the shoes of the slumbering patron they didnt know that the porter worked a hour week and earned about nineteen cents an hour before tips randolph launched into the difficult tasks of organizing members and building public support he argued the porters case in the black worker now the official organ of the union and toured the country speaking to hundreds of audiences the pullman company which had only accepted white labor unions after a bitter struggle and a bloody strike refused to recognize a black one instead union porters began to lose their jobs filipinos and mexicans were hired to replace them the company called randolph a wildeyed uppity negro hustler who never made up a pullman berth in his life and circulated stories that he was an exploiter of his own race and a communist but randolph was a persuasive organizer by  the brotherhood could claim well over half the porters and pullman maids its  members constituted the largest single block of organized negro workers in industry it was a remarkable achievement in april  the porters rallied around their new leader in a nearunanimous show of strength and confidence they voted to strike in order to win recognition of their union randolph didnt want a strike he was gambling and he lost the governments mediation board refused to step in other unions lent no support and the company prepared to break the strike facing the certain prospect of mass firings and the destruction of the union randolph called off the strike it took the depression and the social revolution of the new deal to unionize america pullman was forced by law to recognize any unions chosen by its employees and owing to randolphs tireless work the porters once more overwhelmingly chose the brotherhood in   years to the day after he had begun the pullman car company signed its first agreement with a philip randolph of the sleeping car porters never before had a white employer signed an agreement with a negro labor leader when the national negro congress was organized in the midnineteen thirties a philip randolph became its president this militant organization was a forerunner of presentday civil_rights groups such as the congress of racial equality core and the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc the following is a quote taken from the national secretarys report on the aims of the organization in the official proceedings of the national negro congress chicago meeting february  mittee which deliberated on resolutions submitted to the congress for the purpose of allowing for the maximum interchange of opinion between delegates subsessions of the congress were held dividing delegates in the morning into sections on the basis of the particular phase of the negro problem in which each was interested in addition the youth subsessions was further divided into smaller discussion groups in this way easily one half of the delegates were able to give voice to their opinions to make suggestions and to actively influence the proceedings at general sessions held in the evening invited speakers and leading delegates were heard upon important topics and the legislative measures of the congress were adopted the national negro congress was called to meet the increasingly difficult economic and social problems which face the negro people in america the need for the establishment through united action of a strong movement against the social and economic repressions being experienced by the negro made such a congress imperative while major stress at the congress was laid upon joint action by negroes themselves there remained very clearly in the minds of the delegates the need for cooperation with friendly organizations of members of other races to solve the common economic problems facing all likewise it was realized that the negro congress must exist as a federation of organizations for the purpose of pooling the strength of constituent groups in the attack upon the evils retarding the securing by the negro of his manhood rights the congress was not formed and does not exist to duplicate the work of any existing organization rather it exists to add strength and to give support to every progressive and meaningful program in aid of the negro people in their just demand for equal opportunity and complete social and economic rights the congress had no desire to exclude any group that sincerely worked for the expressed aims of the  congress and any group that so worked could not be charged with unduly influencing or dominating its activity and of the constituent groups participating it can be accurately stated that none attempted such domination in his keynote address to the delegates assembled in chicago on this occasion randolph said i greet you in the spirit of the deathless courage of the th and th century black rebels and martyrs of human justice in the spirit of frederick douglass and nat turner of gabriel and denmark vesey of harriet tubman and sojourner truth those noble rebels who struck out in the dark days of slavery that negro men and women might be free    we have met in times of worldwide storm and stress of social confusion economic chaos political disorder and intellectual uncertainty social institutions from the church to the family are undergoing change and instability unemployment falls like a deadening pall upon every great power and machine nation    already fascist italy is on the march to subjugate the ancient kingdom of ethiopia while france and germany are in a state of truce still at bay   now what of the american scene it is no less forbidding and full of contradictions unsettlement and cross currents in our social economic and political life    our contemporary history is a witness to the stark fact that black america is a victim of both class and race prejudice and oppression this congress is called to attempt to meet the problems of black america the submerged tenth of the population with the advent of the second world war randolph became increasingly concerned about the exelusion of negroes from jobs in the war industries while on a southern trip with milton webster an official of the pullman porters union he conceived the idea of a massive negro march on washington he wrote the dramatic plan in the afroamerican press and agitated for it on the street corners of harlem and throughout the united states his efforts bore fruit as local march on washington committees sprung up across the country hearing of the proposed march new yorks mayor laguardia and mrs franklin d roosevelt called randolph to city hall and sought to persuade him from executing it following this meeting which failed in its purpose randolph was summoned to the white house where he met with president franklin d roosevelt and his advisors when randolph firmly reiterated his refusal to cancel the march unless negroes were guaranteed equal employment opportunities roosevelt on june   issued executive order  establishing the presidents committee on fair employment practices the order issued the march was called off and the national council for a permanent fepc was set up with randolph and dr alan knight chalmers as cochairmen it was not long before randolph was involved in another aspect of the struggle against job discrimination railway unions and companies had long been in collusion against the hiring of negro locomotive firemen whose difficulties became more acute with the development of diesel engines at their request randolph formed the provisional committee of firemen which initiated legal action resulting in a  supreme court decision outlawing antinegro union deals with railroads in  randolph won still another executive order this time from president truman testifying before the senate armed services committee randolph had indicated he would call upon negroes not to register for military duty from a harlem platform he was called to the white house by the president who shortly thereafter issued executive order  establishing a committee on equality of treatment and opportunity in the armed forces meanwhile randolph had become a leading figure in the american federation of labor and when the afl merged with the cio was elected a vicepresident of the combined body and a member of its man executive councilthe only negro to hold this position within the labor movement and its conventions over the years randolph pressed the fight against all forms of discrimination and segregation largely owing to his efforts whiteonly clauses have been eliminated from the constitutions of all international unions randolph recognized however that the elimination of constitutional barriers would be only the first step toward the full integration of the negro into the house of labor and that continued pressure from negro workers would be required for further progress to organize this pressure he founded the negro american labor council and was elected its first president at its first meeting in cleveland november   while the labor movement has been the focus of randolphs crusade for racial democracy his preeminence in the overall civil_rights struggle had brought him the unofficial title of dean of negro leaders and made him much sought after not only by civil_rights activists but by african leaders as well in  with dr martin_luther_king jr just emerged into national leadership from the montgomery bus boycott randolph led  americans in the prayer pilgrimage to washington in  and  he chaired two youth marches for integrated schools involving  and  young people respectively in the book the day they marched lerone bennett senior editor of ebony magazine gives us the following description of the historic march on washington  it was the beginning of something and the ending of something it came  years and  days after the signing of the emancipation proclamation it came like a force of nature like a whirlwind like a flood it overwhelmed by its massiveness and finality a quarter of a million people were in it and of it and millions more watched on tv and huddled around radios there had never been anything quite like it a tv spectacular a sunday school picnic a political convention an impressive demonstration of negro unity ka visible expression of interracial brotherhood and almost unprecedented exhibition of resolve a new concept of lobbying a show of strength an outburst a call to the national conscience the mammoth march on washington was everything they said it was and more and it moved men and women as they had never been moved before the planning and execution of this massive march was the highwater mark in the long and eventful career of a philip randolph by this time the itinerant preachers son had been invited to the white house by four u s presidents back in  he had accompanied the militant negro leader w monroe trotter to an interview with calvin coolidge to protest lynching and on june   he was spokesman for a delegation of civil_rights leaderers who met with president eisenhower two more presidential visitswith kennedy and johnsonwere to follow but under radically different circumstances for late in  in the midst of an upsurging civil_rights revolution a philip randolph called negro leaders together to map out plans for a new march on washington this time there would be no cancellation despite political pressures randolph had become convinced that a dramatic display of mass action was essential if the nation was to make progress towards full civil_rights trade unions liberals and religious groups lent unprecedented support to the plan and on august   more than a quarter million americans black and white descended on the capitol in a demand for jobs and freedom as father and director of the march the largest demonstration in the history of the country randolph had forged an extraordinary unit between the negro community and its white allies and in the process renewed his unsought position as dean of negro leaders
negro students and their parents are often in a dilemma when it comes to deciding for or against a negro allege or an integrated one there  colleges and universities in this country that were established for and are operated primarily for negroes located primarily in the south or in border states  are private and  are taxsupported of the  undergraduate negro students enrolled in college today slightly over twothirds are in these institutions in general negroes attend these colleges so that they can acquire lifelong friends and participate without restrictions in extracurricular activities such as fraternities and sororities also the cost of attending a negro college is considerably less than that of attending a predominately white one even so it must be realized that equal education in most instances proves to be the key to true equality to other areas of life on the american scene the predominately negro college is considered a segregated institution if it is agreed that students should be permitted to grow and learn in an integrated environment then it seems necessary to break the negro college tradition among negroes although these colleges may have integrated faculties and token numbers of white students they are still considered segregated institutions and therefore less desirable for preparing students to live in an integrated society than are interracial colleges in all fairness and objectivity the only adequate generalization one can make about negro colleges is that they are uniformly worse off then their white counterparts first their students are almost exclusively negro a fact that does not necessarily make for a weak college were all other things equal most negro students come from  poor allnegro high schools which have long suffered the pangs of discrimination in the south as well as in the north thus the colleges have been forced to take the students where they are and while southern education for negroes and whites is inferior as compared to that in the north it is worse for negroes than for whites the cumulative effects of an inferior elementary and secondary education have been reflected in the type of students who enter and graduate from the negro college the student is generally bankrupt in verbal skills on national examinations he has generally scored extremely low when compared with his white counterparts this problem stems from the vicious cycle of poorly prepared negro college graduates teaching academically weak high school students who go on to inferior negro colleges the teachers the faculty in negro colleges is predominately negro a fact which in itself has nothing to do with the quality of teaching which eventuates were it not for certain builtin conditions which do contribute to poor teaching first more than twothirds of all negro college teachers graduated from segregated high schools and colleges in the south where academic standards have been shown to be considerably lower than those maintained in white schools in the same area further many would not be in teaching were it not for restrictions of segregation having not planned to enter teaching they now feel trapped and their trapped feelings create in them an indifference to their work twothirds of them indicate that they maintain low or at least flexible academic standards in their classes they enjoy a unique kind of security of not having to compete with scholars in the wider community this often means that they may occupy positions for which they are not qualified the scarcity of qualified teachers results in edds doctors of education teaching courses in history science mathematics and english there is in general an antiintellectual atmosphere on most negro college campuses however since college teaching is probably the most prestigeful occupation among negroes there is a great deal of jockeying for position in the segregated academic community serious matters often take the backseat while they engage in society activities calculated to give them added prestige in the college setting it also means that they do not have time to read attend the theatre or give thought to serious scholarly work their society orientation results in a kind of ideaphobia they allow their lives to be subsumed by trivia this is probably one of the reasons why negro college teachers rarely have time to do scholarly research and writing there are several other reasons why negro college teachers are only about half as productive academically as are their white counterparts first they are isolated from the mainstream of academic life in this country second they are generally unprepared to do worthwhile independent research and creative writing third heavy academic duties allow them little time to write their median teaching load being  hours weekly fourth there are seldom funds available for research fifth few negro colleges expect their teachers to engage in research and creative writing this appears to be a result of the ideaphobia prevalent on many campuses the teacher who writes anything worthwhile may be criticized deprecated and finally ostracized as a social misfit in many cases he is asked to resign because of his radical ideas this happens not only in state universities controlled by segregationists but in private schools as well dr w e b du bois one of this centurys greatest scholars was forced to leave a private negro university shortly before he moved to ghana because of his radicalism although negroes with doctorates are few in number they are fast leaving the negro campuses for jobs in industry government and white colleges this is probably why today only  per cent of the teachers at negro colleges have doctorates as compared to  per cent at white institutions while the negro college teacher in general is an unhappy person usually because he although more highly educated than the general community has to suffer the indignities inherent in living in southern cities and hamlets it is the negro phd who is most unhappy educated in liberal environments of the east and the north he literally suffocates in the confines of the south the fact that most negro college presidents are autocrats is also significantly contributory to teacher unhappiness it is understandable that the greatest turnover in negro colleges is among teachers with doctorates quite the reverse of the situation in interracial institutions it is because of the phd exodus that negro colleges must rely more heavily on teaching faculty at the instructor level  per cent than do white institutions  per cent in general the negro college is a small institution with an average enrollment of approximately  students fifty per cent of them have enrollments of less than  the size poverty and lack of strong teachers cause them to restrict their curricular offerings thirty per cent of the faculty in white institutions as contrasted with  per cent in negro institu tions are teaching engineering mathematics and biological and physical sciences conversely  per cent of the faculty in negro colleges and only  per cent in white colleges are teaching education courses english physical education and home economics further negro institutions are handicapped in the areas of physical plant housing facilities for students and faculty and library limited classroom facilities make it necessary to set up large classes limited dormitory facilities force students to live in crowded and often unwholesome conditions financial difficulties also limit the number and kinds of volumes available in their libraries in general negro college libraries leave much to be desired although the negro college has prepared the majority of todays outstanding negro leaders there is some doubt that it can meet the needs of the negro student today society has become more complex and more integrated in the last few years a negro college education is hardly adequate for the majority of negro youth this is not to say that some negro colleges are not producing in spite of the severe handicaps under which they labor topnotch students interracial colleges in the past few negro students have sought admission to interracial or allwhite colleges in many cases the cost of attending was prohibitive students felt that their backgrounds were weak and they did not wish to appear to be academically dull in the company of whites also the negro student having grown up in a segregated community and having attended an allnegro high school either in the south or in a northern ghetto felt unsure of himself and anxious around whites however there are good reasons for believing that such fears are unfounded for over  years the national scholarship and service fund for negro students has assisted more than  negro students enroll in interracial colleges throughout the country in  kenneth b clark and lawrence plotkin under the sponsorship of nssfns made an extensive study of the success of these students of the  students included in the study they found that the net dropout rate was onefourth the national average fewer than  per cent of the students as compared to approximately  per cent of white students do not complete college the study further indicated that negro students enrolled in predominantly white institutions of higher learning did average or better academic work thirtyone per cent achieved an average of b or better and  per cent achieved c or worse for the four years enrolled slightly less than  per cent graduated with honors and about one per cent were elected to phi beta kappa although the clark and plotkin study indicates that negro students in predominantly white colleges adjust socially and participate fully in the activities of college life there are still some reasons to believe that negro students segregate themselves in large college and university environments although a few students attempt to lose themselves among white students and try to deny their negroness the majority form little congoes and refuse to associate with whites outside the classroom the fact that negro students in predominantly white institutions choose to mingle with their own kind is not unusual since it is observed that indian chinese african and other likecultural groups tend to mingle more freely among themselves than they do among white american students the clark and plotkin study suggests when it reports that  per cent of the negro students said that they do not read negro newspapers that attending small predominantly white liberal arts colleges tends to make negro students antinegro in their personal orientation although there may be some undesirable effects from attending a white school it is felt that the negro student will be more able to compete in an integrated society if he attends an integrated school rather than an allnegro college
it has often puzzled i d me when some amer£ icans have approached me with the question are you a negro when it is very obvious that i do represent an unmistakable specimen of that which the anthropologist will call negroid not long ago i heard over the radio that two negroes and a canadian were captured trying to blowup the statue of liberty in new york those referred to as negroes were of course americans of african descent while the canadian was of course a canadian of french descent often referred to as frenchcanadian what actually is meant by negro in the american usage could it be a racial social economic political or cultural categorization if racially categorized the term negro as commonly used in the united states of america would seem less accurate and less scientific there are only very few people who can actually be classified as negroes in the united states the greater number of the ethnic group called negroes are stock blended of africans american indians europeans and asiatics in fact there is no pure race anywhere today in the world furthermore the phrase colored people used sometimes for negroes in america appears psychologically unwholesome as much as it is equivocal and ambiguous physical science teaches that anything visible is colored otherwise it will be invisible so that colored should be equally applicable to all varieties of mankind or races if colored means noncaucasian then it should be equally applicable to all peoples not whitesuch as the japanese indian chinese tahitian samoans etc but in america the word colored seems to be tagged to the ethnic group called negroes in this case the label does not appear to describe the goods negroism is an american creation it is an american concept not based on economic deprivation or lack of education or on cultural sterility but on white americans idea of the african type of man blackman and that mans place in the american society it is an american concept that is socially derived politically sanctioned and economically abused to the typical white american negro means a man whose entire ways of life must be fashioned in the image of the white mans before he is recognized as a human being it means a person of inferior race who should do menial jobs shine shoes or wait at tables it means a man who must lose his unique identity in a country diffused with prevailing customs of racial dichotomy many white americans both literate and illiterate have yet to overcome that irrational and unscientific notion of race that has been instilled in them through their processes of socialization that irrational notion has become a deepseated mental attitude usually externalized in different degrees of intensity in the american society it is that irrational notion that seduces many socalled white liberals into feeling that they are best qualified to solve the economic social political and psychological problems of the socalled negroesno white liberal can categorically negate the psychological connotations of negroism by posing as the friend of the negroes liberalism is not an adequate cloak for paternalism and ethnocentricism those white liberals who often pose as negro friends are the same individuals who will not invite colored students to their houses for fear of what their neighbors will say they are the same academicians who will threaten their white secretaries with employment termination because they held hands with black students on the university campus they are the same academicians who will take a jab at the academic capabilities of negro students but have failed to motivate them or demonstrate teaching excellence they are the same individuals who are always concerned about opportunities for the negroes but always make sure that other white liberals are employed first they are the same individuals who insist that negro writers must write about human beings not about negroes even though those writers have accumulated their experiences as negroes could these wellmeaning academicians be inferring that negroes are not human beings it definitely seems that there is in the present american society a growing conflict between social objectives of the people and their religious consciences this conflict has definitely tinged and affected social consciousness and democratic processes it is not necessary for the negro to be what the white americans think he should be before he can fully participate in the american society or gain recognition of his human dignity it is not at all not necessary that the negro strive to pattern his entire life and personality after the white man before he can be counted no man in the face of the world is more pathetic than that man who finds himself wedged between two cultures to neither of which he fully belongs the negro has identity which must be recognized and reckoned with the negro has a history which is unique and worth teaching in all american schools it is not necessary for the negro to lose his identity before his human dignity can be recognized and respected actually until the whites and the blacks in america mutually know and respect each other there is going to be a long and bitter struggle for universal peace and progress there must be unequivocal concessions of democratic  rights social justice cultural courtesy and human dignity in america without the insidious categorizations of negroism the present negroes are no longer a people cringing and fawning but rather a people becoming more aware of their own power and potentialities a people beginning to take a pride in their marvelous achievements and ever determined to obtain a just and due treatment in a nation supposedly founded on the great ideals of freedom justice equality and respect for human personality of recent in america the black man has come to articulate the ideology of black_power many bigots racists and prejudiced individuals have distorted the ideology and equated it to racism violence and lawlessness some black americans have even joined the ranks of the biased critics and racists this is the unkindest cut of all black_power is not an ideology of hate nor of violence nor of fatalistic destruction it is rather an ideology of love and peace articulating political strength economic viability social dignity and cultural identity for the oppressed black man white power by its very nature is not analogous to black_power white power structure is viciousracially obsessed and characterized by narrowminded exclusiveness black_power on the other  hand is the expression of those who know and understand the agony pain and humiliation of negroism in america it is an expression born out of the frustrations and agony of those who have been denied human rights and objective manhood in a society supposedly founded on the ideal of freedom justice and equality white power structure that has condoned social evils and the emasculation of the black man has yet to be objectively repudiated as evil and violent but yet the same supporters of that white power structure and establishment decry black_power which by its very nature speaks of love and dignity for the emasculated black man   black_power does not speak of violence but of the right of selfdefense even as guaranteed in the constitution of the united states of america syllogistic reasoning should not be used to obviate the evil realities of white power structure and establishment because some who chant black_power articulate their ghetto frustrations by riot does not make black_power violent likewise because christianity was used to justify economic exploitation political strangulation and social deprivation in south africa rhodesia and other europeancolonized areas of the world does not necessarily make christianity evil and violent  that the pope blessed italian soldiers before their atrocious rape of ethiopia in the third decade of the twentieth century does not make catholicism racist and violent the function of an ideology is not necessarily the acid test of its truth or falsity therefore those who denigrate the ideology of black_power should read history or look far into the sociopolitical realities of the times the ideology of black_power must become the ideology of all people who share the brotherhood of blackness this brotherhood of blackness is not a brotherhood based solely on the issue of being black it is rather a brotherhood based on the hard fact that a majority of those who have been consistently denied the right of selfdetermination human dignity and respect for human personality are the blacks and the nonwhite black_power is the symbolic call to all black people to unite and organize for the assumption of the only power that will regenerate them from the onslaught of persistent sociopolitical degradation and relentless economic deprivation and exploitation black_power is the clarion call for functional collectivization of the black masses for an ultimate assumption and sharing of economic and political power through constructive and objective programs as an ideology black_power addresses itself to an old and perennially vital question to what extent can a man determine his own destiny parenthetically it is asking the question to what extent can and should the socalled negro determine his destiny in a society with a prevailing custom of racial dichotomy in such a society identity has become a crucial issue the socalled negro because of the high degree of his physical visibility continues to face unique problems despite civil_rights laws black_power articulates the issue of identity and likens the socalled negro to a guitar string an ordinary guitar string that is unattached to a guitar may appear to be free twist one end of it and it may respond as a free string but it is not free to produce music as a guitar string is supposed to do but when it is fixed to a guitar and tightened until taut then and only then is it free to be a guitar string that will produce music black_power visualizes the socalled negro without identity without culturewithout economic and political power in america as like the guitar string unmounted a thing mute inert and without power it is saying in essence that the socalled negro with economic and political power in america will be like the guitar string mountedpossessing voice and almost a soul the guitar string however great its potentialities can never wail or produce music at will it can have no autonomy or recognition its destiny will lie in the hands of its master likewise the socalled negro may have marvellous potentialities he may have made progress in america he may have civil_rights bills passed for him but he is nowhere unless he has economic political and social power as well as a proud sense of identity such identity has nothing to do with merely being black or with the sociocultural virtues or qualities of african heritage it is an identity based on the common issues of racially buttressed economic and political oppression and subjugation in the united states of america with its prevailing custom of racial dichotomy ethnic pride or appreciation is not the same thing as ethnic or racial conceit an intelligent modification of ethnic identity and appreciation has functional importance for the perspective and objective maintenance of societal image or equilibrium black_power unequivocally articulates desegregation but not integration and assimilation in the united states for those who urge integration the big questions are integration into what or whose society integration at what price is the socalled negro an american if not why is he not if he is an american then why is he a negro and why is he walking the streets of america for over  years begging for civil_rights which are already guaranteed all americans in the constitution of the united states even the displaced europeans who found refuge in america since the two world wars are already enjoying civil_rights even from the very first day they arrived in the united states yet the socalled negro who shed his blood sweat and tears in order that europe could have peace liberty and freedom is still to enjoy that same peace liberty and freedom the children of the same displaced europeans who found refuge in a merica are now the ones who spit and throw stones tomatoes eggs and insults at the children of the same socalled negroes who gave their lives blood sweat and tears to free europe from the grips of nazism and fascism what guarantees of real freedom are there for the socalled negroes in the united states with its white power structure black_power says emphatically that integration into the present american white society is not consistent with reality because this white power structure with its established system was built and is sustained through a systematic exploitation and subjugation of the black man inside and outside of the united states therefore to advocate the integration of the black man into such a system is nothing short of delusion and ethnic suicide  the call of black_power is the call for functional collectivization of the black masses for their ultimate liberation and entrenchment in a position of economic and political power it is a call that urges the oppressed black masses to unite and engage in a painstaking systematic building of an organization necessary for the assumption and sharing of economic and political power in the united states black_power is an ideology that calls upon the black masses to lead and essentially finance their own organization in order to sustain that potentiality needed for action and direction ethnic pride and identity must not be sacrificed for meaningless integration no ethnic group in america subjugates its organization under the control and leadership of another ethnic group the jews lead and control jewish organizations the polishamericans control polishamerican organizations the japaneseamericans control the japaneseamerican organizations even the chineseamericans control the chineseamerican organizations it is therefore not racism if black_power urges the black man to lead and control his organizations such an advocacy is very consistent with americanism black_power operates within the framework of americanism and therefore should not be called racist and violent unless we are saying in essence that americanism is racist and violent  for the black man in search of identity and power in america black_power is the ideology of the time it is the ideology that will expurgate the economic and political paralysis that emasculates and humiliates the black man in the white power structure and system in the united states black_power does not mean black isolationism or separatism but rather black unity and cooperation for a meaningful participation in the complex society of the united states of america black_power is not analogous to white supremacy neither does it mean racial polarization or dichotomization black_power means to the socalled negroes what zionism means to the jews the centralization of ethnic effort and the recognition of an ethnic fountain black_power rejects both white racialism and black chauvin m ism it merely articulates racial or ethnic coexistence on the basis of equality and respect for human personality
language has in rej ti £ cent years been recog i i nized as a sociological factor in the life of a society both consciously and unconsciously language can influence the attitudes of a people as regards the components of their environment it has been generally overlookedhowever that language can have a decided effect in engendering racial prejudice cultural anthropology has much to say on the broad question of culture contact between the dominant and minority groups in a society and language has been delineated as an area of such contact however this delineation has been generally restricted primarily to the origin and development of language little emphasis has been placed upon the link between language patterns and race relations an examination therefore of the connection of language and prejudice towards the negro could illuminate those areas of race relations not heretofore stressed language as a potent force in our society goes beyond being merely a communicative device language not only expresses ideas and concepts but may actually shape them often the process is completely unconscious with the individual concerned unaware of the influence of the spoken or written expressions upon his thought processes language can thus become an instrument of both propaganda and indoctrination for a given idea the dominant majority in the united states has introduced the element of language in buttressing negro stereotyping it is generally accepted that such stereotyping is one of the prime contributory factors to the development of prejudice so powerful is the role of language in its imprint upon the human mind that even the minority group may begin to accept the very expressions that aid in its stereotyping thus even negroes may develop speech patterns filled with expressions leading to the strengthening of stereotypes an analysis of the symbolic meanings of some of our language components that can release the trigger of the stereotype reveals that these meanings are a force of underestimated potency in race relations the analysis that follows is admittedly a cursory review of the subject however it is hoped that it will lead to further discussion and exploration it could prove fruitful to select a number of expressions current upon our present scene in order to discern their connection with prejudice towards the negro we are here not concerned with the origins of these expressions but only with their sociological significance to modern american life dark horse this expression is commonly used to describe an individual who achieves a particular goal without a previous display of ability or social traits necessary for the achievement in a sense it connotes a development arising completely out of fortuitous circumstances unrelated to the merits of the individual concerned thus the dark horse in a presidential nominating convention is a person whose talents for political office have been unrecognizable prior to his sudden emersence as a candiw date and whose success has been completely unpredictable aside from the dramatic spectacle of a political convention the term has a similar meaning for events in everyday life the dark horse for example will get the job despite his lack of qualifications for it as used by the white majority the term becomes shrouded in concepts of inferiority it is not farfetched to suggest that these concepts are carried over to attitudes concerning darkskinned peoples in general the danger of the term lies in the idea that dark somehow or other signifies lack of ability in a particular endeavor a dark person therefore begins his ascent to a particular goal devoid of the characteristics necessary for its final achievement and only fulfills his objectives as a result of a completely unexplainable accident the effect of the expression upon a white person may be unconscious but as a symbol it can become ingrained into the mental processes and lead to the formation of stereotyped thinking black in general language use throughout the history of western civilization the word black has had a particular significance with the rise of the commercial exploitation of the peoples of africa and asia this significance has solidified into a format that evolved from the dominant socioeconomic forces of western society our own english language has carried over much of this significance and developed some of its own again even the minority group whose interests run counter to the symbolic use of this word in our culture may accept it as a part of its language patterns in the evolution of language certain components have evoked images created in the context of a culture thus the sociocultural setting in which the word black becomes a part of language can shape its symbolic as against its formal  meaning in our present day culture black symbolizes evil uncleanliness defamation such usage is found in both everyday speech as well as poetic imagery this conception of evil is also found in our designation of magic as black or white with black magic connoting a greater degree of banefulness than white magic even a cursory examination of websters new collegiate dictionary reveals the existence of adverse implications attached to the word black perhaps it would be valuable to pointup these implications by listing the following sampling blackballto exclude from membership or ostracize blackbook  a book containing names that are out of favor or in disgrace blackendefame or sully blackguarda person who uses scurrilous language or treats others with foul abuse blackletterunlucky inauspicious as in blackletter days blacklista list of persons regarded as suspect or as deserving of censure blackmailextortion by intimidation black dogthe spirit of illhumor or melancholy as to be under the black dog the above meanings are in addition to others of everyday usage thus black looks are defined as sullen hostile foreboding black cruelty as foully or outrageously wicked a black mark as indicating disgrace or dishonor and black market as a violation of official quotas or priorities in addition a white lie is an untruth of little importance or consequence while a black lie signifies mendacity at its worst in both dictionary and colloquial meanings black has become linkedup with all that mankind should eschew while whitein most instanceshas become the symbol of purity and goodness that we should embrace both as individuals and as a community these concepts cannot be considered accidental and undoubtedly would not exist in a society wherein whites were a minority historically these concepts have evolved as a result of the need of the dominant group to maintain social and economic relationships on the basis of inequality if its hegemony was to survive the white child in our society therefore becomes instilled with the prevailing thinking on race relations through language and this thinking is difficult to overcome once the roots of language have imbedded themselves into pliant minds the child carries into adulthood the various connotations mainly unfavorableof the word black that he has garnered through the years black sheep the term black sheep is utilized in all segments of our society to denote an individual who seems almost completely immobilized in his efforts to effect an adjustment to his environment that could result in fulfilling personal familial and community responsibilities oh hes the black sheep in our family is a common description of an individual commanding little status we might ask ourselves what would have happened if in the development of language the word white were used in describing an individual whose seeming irresponsibility society condemns our answer lies again in the relation of the word to the formation of racial stereotypes undoubtedly the white majority would not accept the infiltration of such a characterization into our language the acceptance of the term black sheep however assists in the creation of a stereotype of negro irresponsibility which has become so valuable to the advocates of prejudice black and white modern liberal and progressive movements whether in politics anthropology sociology or psychology stress the oneness of the human family this approach for example has become the basic philosophy of the united nations it is continually pointed out that human beings everywhere have the same basic needs and that variations in behavior are due to a very great extent to cultural differences social scientists generally agree that the things the peoples of the world have in common outweigh their differences the language usage of our particular society however does not seem to accept the conclusions of our social scientists in such usage black and white are considered opposites in describing personalities or events to paraphrase kipling our language patterns seem to be telling us that white is white and black is black and never the twain shall meet thus we say show it to me in black and white that is in all the different phases of the problem here we have an implication not of unity but of divergence the fostering of opposition through language can be responsible for lack of identification with the problems of minority groups the concept that the differences between peoples are greater than the similarities may become paramount at times this may not be discernible in mass movements for economic and political equality but may be revealed in the day to day relationships of negroes and whites in the large urban areas in which both groups are heavily represented language in a society does not develop apart from that societys historical economic and political evolution the interconnection of language with other forces can be best seen through its usage as a form of symbol pure language does not exist a word may have a particular meaning in a society and a totally different one in another in modem american life language has become the fulcrum of prejudice as regards negrowhite relationships its effect has been equally potent upon the overt bigot as well as the confused member of the public who is struggling to overcome conscious or unconscious hostility towards minority groups in the case of the negro language concepts have supported misconceptions and disoriented the thinking of many on the question of race and culture the concept of racial inferiority and the stereotyped thinking that accompanies it is one of the products of our current language usage described herein the entire area of semantics has been explored in recent years as it relates to propaganda of various types here however we are dealing with meanings of words that the semanticists often ignore the dictionary meanings that metamorphize into symbolic connotations because of their connection with the color of a minority group the semanticist may deal with abstract words like liberal reactionary banker or monopolist and stress that the dictionary meanings have been obliterated in a war of points of view the words dealt with in this article have infested our culture through both dictionary and pointsofview meanings they are in a sense more dangerous and more difficult to counteract than such abstractions as liberal or reactionary language is the mirror of a society reflecting its attitudes and thinking as a society changes its concepts through political action and education its language patterns may be modified thus in years to come the symbols black and white may no longer take on divergent meanings and much of the other terminology referred to in this article may become extinct in its place there may be substituted a more honest appraisal of color with a resultant favorable effect upon race relations until that time however the relationship of language to prejudice towards the negro will be of import to the social scientist working to meet the challenges arising out of the problems of race relations in present day america
when douglas turner wards two short plays happy ending and day of absence opened in chicago critic glenna syse of the chicago suntimes provided a perfect illustration of both the dilemma of the negro playwright versus the white critic and of the fact that negro playwrights have no alternative but to turn to black audiences the dilemma has been dealt with by ward himself in the pages of the new york times and to some extent by addison gayle jr in negro digest january  and by hoyt w fuller in african forum autumn  and the progressive october  but the problem of the black writer and the white critic is so important that it cannot be confronted too frequently indeed it must be dragged out again and again until finally the black writer understands the direction he must take and the black audience recognizes its responsibility to the black writer and to itself the white criticwell he will do what he has to do when he is not catered to when his opinions and his assumptions no longer have power over the black playwright but first a word about the authors two plays both plays are comedy satires with sharp jagged teeth drawing their substance and their thrust from the bittersweet reality of race relations as seen from the bottom side of the coin position then is of the essence here for it is position which ultimately draws the barrier between the playwright and the critic in happy ending two sisters maidsofallwork in the home of a rich white couple gloomily face the possibility of a divorce for their employers they are weeping and moaning at home when their young nephew a raging rascal of a militant finds them discovering the cause of their grief he launches forth into a tirade of reprimands evoking the shades of freedom now and relegating his aunts to the nether world of aunt tommies then just as he in disgust starts to leave all togged and debonair the aunts call him back and on the carpet with elaborate sarcasm the two women remind the young man that every thing he owns and enjoysfrom the clothes on his back to the thick steaks in the ice boxcomes from their rich white employers that in fact they have all been living in the lap of luxury for nine years on the largesse the white family unwittingly has bestowed upon the maids a divorce would spoil all that for it would break up the white family and force the aunts to find new jobs realizing all this the brash and roguish young nephew feels like shedding a few tears himself the happy ending of the plays title comes when the white employer phones and asks one of the aunts to come over and babysit announcing that he and his nymphomaniac of a wife have reconciled and that there will be no divorce in day of absence billed as a reverse minstrel show the comedy is broad and heavy the negro actors wear white faces and a few of them are wildly ingenuous a lilywhite young southern matron for example is played in bright blonde shirley temple curls and a sheer white nightgown the towns mayor expertly mugged by playwright ward is all southern colonel blimpy and blustery and one of the local gentry cruelly a prototype is a lazy drawling obscenity the plays proposition concerns the reaction among the whites in a southern town when all the nigrahs suddenly vanish panic and pandemonium garbage collects services go lacking households go unattended families cannot function industries grind to a halt hospitals are menacedthings fall apart in desperation the town even tries to borrow some nigrahs from some other town it is all a clownerie unapologetic buffoonerybut it whacks the funny bone and it drives home a deadly stiletto so what happened well the audiencewhich was about threefifths black on opening nightate it up they were practically rolling in the aisles but bright and early the following morning critic glenna syse gave the impression that she had attended a wake pronounced she okas satirethe subject is on target sitting pretty for a sharpshooter trouble is ward takes aim kills and then keeps shooting at the body he doesnt know how to develop his premise dramatically after his first volley he loses grasp instead of gaining momentum it just lies there and soon becomes tiresome    tiresome tiresome for whom certainly not for the audience but then miss syse winds up her critique a pity the tiresomeness because his wards ideas are good but his execution is completely inadequate and unfortunately his olayers do more to handicap than ielp his material plain poppycock and she never once mentioned the hilarity in the audience however miss syse had given her real thesis away in the first paragraphs of her review and it actually was unnecessary to read through to the conclusion here is the way she began douglas turner ward is that uncommon combinationboth playwright and actorand he appeared in both capacities he proved among other things that he is a versatile and vigorous voice in the american theater    but then came this there are far too few negroes acting in and writing for the american theater and that is one reason why wards contribution deserves special attention    all the old crowing condescension in between her beginning and her ending miss syse glossed over the essence of the two plays she even judged day of absence as a more significant work when that evaluation is questionable for happy ending is rooted in hard fact day of absence is flight of fancy the first play suggests something of the ingenuous strategy negroes have had to fashion for survival while day of absence chiefly highlights the ironic need and the neurotic fixation white southerners have for the black pariahs among them significance too is subjective miss syses review appeared in the suntimes under a banner headline which proclaimed negro playwrightactors satires fail in execution that was at least a matter of opinion among the whites in the audience and it was a baldfaced lie for the blacks but there you are back where we started the black playwright and the white critic are residents of two different worlds clearly the worlds are moving no nearer together just as clearly it is useless for the residents of the one world to keep trying to impose their values and their views on the residents of the other world happy ending and day of absence speak to black people with the resonance of experience the tragedy is that too few black people will avail themselves of its melody and mirth but that is the greater part of the probl
the history of the jazz v r ifa y musician in america is the history of the worst kind of oppression ever perpetrated on a group of people worse because the individuals being oppressed are undoubtedly highly talented persons worse still because they have always existed on the periphery of success they have seen their art make millions for others while they themselves starved or at best barely lived at a subsistence level and for many complex reasons as a group they have been unable to do anything about their condition they go on hoping for individual success hoping for that one chance to break through but it goes without saying very few of them ever break through the best of them die like charlie parker and herbie nichols tragic and broken men who spent the last days of their lives desperately seeking to reaffirm the validity of their art and dignitv a b spellman a young poet political analyst and music critic has attempted to tell the story of four of these men in the book four lives in the bebop business pantheon  the four musicians are ornette coleman cecil taylor the late herbie nichols and jackie mclean spellman has allowed the musicians to tell their own stories and has himself been contented with writing an interesting introduction and with occasionally interpreting the personal comments of the musicians in a larger social context therefore it is not an accident that the experience of these four musicians is ramified not only throughout the lives of other black musicians and also serve as a microcosm of the experience of black america in general essentially it is the experience of rejection no they are asking for acceptance for some intrinsic value that they may have they have seen their legitimate attempts to develop a meaningful art thwarted by everyone from the manager in a night club to those white music critics who set themselves up as judges of black music and then begin to dictate what is right and wrong critics who approach the music with the usual white western prejudices this latter aspect of the problem for example has led cecil taylor to hold most of the critics in great contempt spellman quotes him as saying critics are sustained by our vitality from afar the uninformed egos evergrowing arbitrarily attempt to give absolutes often the absolutes are the classical norms of western music and have very little to do with what black musicians are attempting taylor points out that the critics often look for european derivatives in his music while overlooking  references which grow out of his experience with afroamerican musicians like duke ellington milt jackson and miles davis the trouble was cecil explains they couldnt hear they are listening to the music from a culturally biased point of view this helps nobody and it incenses the musician driving him to a more bitter state of mind this is the aesthetic side of the question on the business side musicians are forced to work for incredibly low wages the record companies are really no help binding the artist to ridiculous contracts and further it has been asserted cheating on the royalties its all one large mess and the pain goes on and on when the breaks come they are never enough they couldnt possibly be since they are often obtained at the expense of artistic integrity and because of the particularly racist nature of american society the jazz musicians entry into the mainstream is untaken with mixed emotions further his relationship wth the establishment is not an equitable one several outspoken musicians like andrew hill a very talented pianist and musicianwriter archie shepp have pointed this out on numerous occasions the black musician is never presumed by white america to be on an equal footing with the classical performer another aspect of spellmans book which should interest us is the tendency towards social alienation which is characteristic particularly of the socalled new musicians this alienation is directly related to the social life of the artist and it is somehow related to the audience which is attracted to the music unlike black music of a few years ago this music is very often played in places more frequented by whites than blacks therefore around a musician like ornette coleman for example there exists a mystique founded primarily on the unstable interest of whites this statement is not intended to take anything away from colemans music it is intended more to put it into its proper social context although coleman has his musical roots in the honking blues sound of the forties and fifties his music is rarely played in the black community the reasons are both economic and social the most apparent hangup in this alienation is that here is an art which is forged out of souls of black people but which black people rarely have the opportunity of appreciating aside from the personal alienation that affects black artists there is the lack of economic security in the black community economics should not be viewed as the prime reason for this alienationthis tendency of our creative individuals to seek refuge in what leroi jones calls the liberated zones of the metropolis most of the black communities of america have not developed the cultural institutions that would sustain and develop a legitimate artistic expression part of the blame for this lies with the negro bourgoisie which for many sociohistorical reasons has not been persistent enough in turning inward on some of its own problems this leaves the musician ready prey to those outside of his group who will throw the slightest crumbs his way and it leads to the torture of a cecil taylor or an ornette coleman spellman has touched on this in his book and the substance of these remarks is reaffirmed in his discussions with all of the musicians represented the other two musicians herbie nichols and jackie mclean do not express the same sense of frustration as taylor and coleman that is these latter musicians express almost an existential aloneness that is not apparent in the lives of herbie nichols and jackie mclean and it is interesting to note that neither nichols nor mclean have had it any easier than coleman or taylor a partial explanation lies in the natural differences in personalities and life experiences otherwise the differences can be explained in the general direction of the art of these musicians the development of nichols and mclean is more closely tied to innovations in the jazz tradition and the concomitant social relations which relate to that tradition while for taylor and coleman there seems to be a tendency to depart from the tradition i say seems to be because i am certain that cecil taylor does not see himself as departing from the tradition of ellington monk and nichols but in artistic terms extending it  what i am attempting to describe essentially is a tendency to socially escape from the wellsprings of the music which has its roots in the black community herbie nichols for all his employment problems is seen intermittently playing before black audiences spellman further points out nichols interest in the popular dance rhythm the mambo and his interest in african music on the other hand mclean was very much associated with the uptown scene in his early musical development and even now is active whenever possible in the social welfare of the community recently musicians and writers like archie shepp and leroi jones have referred to the music personified by ornette coleman and cecil taylor as revolutionary music i feel that this is an abuse of terms the music of archie shepp cecil taylor albert alyer ornette coleman and many other similarly orientated musicians is not revolutionary in any manner that is socially observable this music is exciting however and extremely artistic and it could stand on that alone the appellative revolutionary is not necessary however in order for this music to become tionary it must extend itself into the black community in a manner which heretofore it has failed to do it must mean to the community what the supremes the impressions and james brown now mean and it must have a direct bearing on the political and social life of the community the struggles of the community must somehow be mirrored in the music and in a manner that is readily felt by the people currently the only things revolutionary about the new music are its technical innovations and those are not enough four lives in the bebop business is a significant contribution to the literature of jazz nevertheless there is a need for a more definitive work the field is wide open with many important musicians fast fading into the past and no significant work which evaluates their lives and art spellmans book does not propose any solutions to the problems of the jazz musician and many of the musicians themselves are confused about what to do most of them see their problems from a purely individualistic point of view the problem becomes simply one of failure to obtain employment this is at base true there is also the question of race and the prejudiced manner in which the critical establishment evaluates the music all of this is in spellmans book but a way out of these problems is not so the question iswill more exceptionally gifted musicians like taylor coleman and mclean continue to subsist semirecognized by white america die unknowns like herbie nichols or will they rescue themselves through the unity of their numbers this was attempted once with the jazz composers guild which spellman speaks of but was perhaps a premature effort several young musicians eg milford graves and andrew hill have proposed constructive programs these go from financing musicianowned recording companies to establishing music institutes which could be supported by the community and as well receive funds from private and governmental sources but time is running out there are more and more musicians with no place to go it is also essential that the black_power movement begin to address itself to this whole issue of preserving and controlling the cultural products of the black community the movement must also give the artist a way of expressing his view of the world regrettably many people in the movement view the black artist with the same disdain as the overall white society spellman has helped us all by providing us with an intensely human look at four musicians who deserve far more attention than they are now getting four musicians whose lives have been marred by the appalling malaise of the american cultural scene
the house hidden in a grove of fir trees was made of wood wetly painted so that the boards almost glowed in the dark because wood is so plentiful most of the people who lived in the community surrounding the forest preserve preferred brick houses only people living within the forest had wooden homes and they were few in number if the census takers knew of the familys existence mr mack the head would have been classified as a dragger since chopping down trees was illegal in the forest preserve he had to wait for a natural calamity such as a thunderstorm to uproot trees and shrubbery then he dragged the dead trunk or as much of the wood as he could chop and carry to his back yard once a year usually in the spring before the beginning of the tourist season mr mack took the animals and dolls he had carved from his dragging to the main craft shop in town the women who owned the shop were always pleased to see him his squirrels and pigs were very popular with people shopping for souvenirs driving through to the western states he never said anything other than to discuss prices and ask about the advance on his commission he never tipped his hat or said thank you or even called the women by their names but of course one could not expect too much from his kind no matter how respectable he lookedthe ladies knew that and when the customers asked about the artist the sisters were quick to point out that he was the towns talented negro citizen we get along with him awfully well the fatter of the women would say yes the other sister usually completed the dialogue we can count on seeing him once a year like clockwork i dont understand places like the south we never have racial trouble here mrs mack never came into town her last trip down the path occurred several springs ago mr mack brought the bicycle from under the leanto to drive to the hospital for the birth of their son alvin alvin one of two living beings they brought from mississippi died three days after birth her doctor could not understand what extinguished the babys thin cries when she had seen the stiff little body for the last time mrs mack heard the physicians talking in the corridor of the shining hospital its almost as if the little fellow was afraid to breathe one doctor said mrs mack shut her ears knowing that the doctor spoke the truth she could do nothing but be grateful that her infant son would be buried in this quiet land their other son called rabbit grew into a healthy child with long limbs like the trees he climbed now that he did not require careful attention her days were spent in cooking and in cleaning the housea house that belonged to her she seldom thought of her white family in mississippi the baby boys whose diapers she changed between cleaning and cooking were no longer a part of her mind ever since she and mr mack shut the cabin door for the last time she had succeeded in putting the town out of her thoughts the town with all of the pale faces that ruined her baby frightened and angered her but she and mr mack knew better than to become angry in their town at first they decided to stay hoping that holding him and cuddling him would make their son forget the circle of bright faces in the mississippi field he had come home from playing shirt torn pants caked with red dirt where the boys from town had sat him down and pinched his nose threatening to stop his breathing they had thrown him one from the other sometimes dropping him the way a child bounces a rubber ball by some miracle he had limped home letting the boys take with them his power to speak they could take no chances with other children a voiceless child is after all powerless so during county fair week when she was pregnant again and the whole town was beset with confusion they put on their best clothes left the furniture and starched uniforms in the cabin and walked into town at the bus station they purchased tickets to jackson a usual event all of their friends had relatives to visit there at the jackson bus terminal they walked straight to the map on the terminal wall mrs mack closed her eyes and pointed to the state where they would live when the bus arrived at the town they walked out of it feeling their way toward the forest preserve during the summer the weather was warm in the day life in the forest was like being at home except for sleeping on the leaves by the time fall came mr mack had begun building the house adding to the two rooms year by year a sturdy house he built he himself hauling the logs and painting them white somehow he had managed mrs mack never understood these things to tap a power line so that they had electricity for the small stove mrs mack did not mind the limitations candle light was a small fee for her own life and hers was a good life she was comforted with the thought that alvin was at peace in his new world and rabbit seemed to find some quiet in the woods away from the pale faces in his head if she had her way he would never meet any people of the other kind at least not until he was old enough to understand that some colors were naturally evil she could hear rabbit now in his own room banging the two tin cups the cups had been her measuring utensils until one day she dropped them and their clatter on the smooth floor entranced her son he refused to give up the cup  and when he saw others of varying sizes he insisted on holding them in his chubby hands measuring the two people around him the din from the next room muffled by the wooden beams that separated the kitchen was a constant reminder that he was at home safe with her until he grew old enough to protect himself rabbit sat on the floor legs tucked underneath straddling a sunbeam from the open window his head faced the screen the afternoon sun warming his wide nostrils making his eyelids blink it was time to feed the bear mixing the milk from the box with the same brisk motion he had observed in his mother he poured the liquid air into the smallest cup bearlie would not open his mouth until he pushed a finger in the orange slit and forcibly brought the cup to the bears face he held the cup just so until bearlie had drunk he turned the cup slowly in the sunlight at once washing and rinsing the silver color bouncing in his hand he put the cup to his ear and listened to his mothers footsteps in the next room she would soon be in to look at him when the soft swish of her broom no longer scratched the floor boards her feet would thump toward him in the blue slippers he could feel her shadow behind him youre quiet today rabbit her voice was puffs of soft breath tickling the hair on his neck do you want to see the picture book no he did not want to see the picture book but because she would sit down beside him he would turn the pages his fingers walking slowly stopping at pictures until she grew tired and returned the ebony to the shelf come on in the kitchen with me she seemed to sing as she spoke standing at the door waiting he looked quickly at her then at the window comparing her to the sunlight beyond the sill then slowly he brought the chunky legs together and sprang up bouncing the bearlie in his arms will you pass the milk mrs mack her husband softly touched his wifes hand before he spoke she already had begun sliding the pitcher they did not need words between them for rabbit who should grow up knowing his parents had mister and mistress attached to their names they spoke rabbit was too busy shaking canned milk into his oatmeal turning the paste into soup to notice them mr mack had raised the spoon to his mouth when the strange noise made his hand tremble he looked at his wife to see if she had heard and found her eyes paralyzed his fear caught in her eyes surely no one had driven a car into their part of the forest preserve while they sat stiffened waiting to see if the noise resumed rabbit did not seem to hear the sound he continued stirring his cereal in wide swoops pouring syrup into little wells of oatmeal when he had finished his bowl scraping the sides with two flat fingers they had not heard the noise again the family finished the meal in silence days and nights were not counted each passing evening brought the darkness more quickly to their supper table the leaves were coming down sometimes in great bunches leaving the trees behind the grove arms up in the air his mother said the trees had to undress for the winter after a while he had come to believe everything that she told him whatever she said was always so soon the trees would be covered with green making the cool spots for him and bearlie away from the sun he was walking with bearlie stopping sometimes to wait for a quivering leaf then just when the red wrinkle was coming toward him the wind would blow away the leaf he was at the top of the hill now looking down at the path his father kept cleared of grass he saw the woman walking and knew immediately she was part of the strange noise he had heard past the trees he had listened to the crunch of leaves and twigssomeone walking who did not know his way around the woods she walked in sunlight and the bits and pieces of fallen sun were woven in her hair playing games there at once he wanted to reach out and touch the curls to see if the sun would rub off but something about her made him hush she was a strange kind of person such a funny color perhaps he had seen someone like her but his head would not bring the pictures from the whirring circles into focus if he reached out perhaps she would remember but she did not look up at his outstretched arm she walked past his fingertips toward his house then suddenly he ran determined to leave the stranger behind mrs mack was measuring oatmeal for muffins when she saw him running charging straight toward her he was clutching the bear so tightly all of the stuffing in one arm had coagulated near the top making a shoulder droop he was trying to show her something his eyes glancing at her sweeping the forest preserve and back at her something had frightened her baby she reached down to comfort him and saw the woman walking up the path toward them she pulled rabbit toward her and at the same instant used him to shield herself from the creature hush rabbit its all right see what you have done to my child her eyes carried even harsher words over rabbits head what do you want mrs mack spoke surprised at the  strength of her own voice good morning the thin lips spotted with pink smiled im rosemarie langley from the county service we didnt know you people lived so deep in the forest goodness you really have a long drive into town mrs mack stood in her doorway we dont go but your husband comes in to sell his exquisite carvings he goes but we stay here we found out about you people through your husband one of our caseworkers clerks parttime at sears and saw your husband purchase a boys snowsuit just by chance she mentioned the suit to me and i started wondering why a snowsuit that big wasnt in school and here i am she was suddenly breathless but her teeth became bigger with each smile oh im not here officially today was such a nice day for a drive i parked the car by the picnic grounds and decided to try and find you people our boy doesnt talk so theres no need to send him to school might as well not go if he never says nothing miss langley took a step nearer the door have you had his hearing tested she asked for a moment she looked as if she might peer inside rabbits head he hears a lot of things we dont hear he just dont say nothing about them and we like him the way he is mrs macks voice was stubborn and with each step the caseworker took she retreated farther into the kitchen dragging rabbit on her apron may i come in miss langley asked looks like youre here already mrs mack was surprised at herself a second time at home she wouldnt dare talk like that to one of them but the woman did not pay attention to her curtness now that im here please may i sit down what lovely wood did your husband do the carving on this chair he made all of the furniture youre very fortunate to have such a talented husband is your son artistic too he likes to look at books and he likes to feed the squirrels when he gets older i guess hell learn to use a knife rabbit still had not looked up keeping very still while his mother smoothed his hair stroking away his fear the womans voice made a strange humming sound reaching into every corner of the kitchen when he comes to school of course hell learn to read and write then we can give him tests to see if he has an artistic bent he doesnt need to go to your school when he decides he wants to read the picture book one of us will teach him the words oh you mean youre educated miss langley colored her cheeks matching the pink lips i mean you and your husband went to school i can read a cookbook and he knows how to read a road map but all thats behind us now we dont have no use for your learning those we know who had it never had much use for us she smoothed her son from her apron youre sitting on his chair he dont like the others please move oh im terribly sorry she stood and fluffed the cushion she had crushed mrs mack picked up the shivering rabbit and sat him down perhaps warm cocoa would soothe him cocoa with a pink marshmallow floating on top she dragged his chair to the stove while she mixed cocoa together they watched the caseworker such a cozy little place do you mind if i look around miss langley pulled away from the table and rabbit immediately clutched his mothers skirts she pushed back the curtain only one bedroom thank heavens you have two beds she said shaking her head but do you really think thats wise having him sleep in the same room with you mrs mack felt herself blush shame on her for making such talk even if she didnt come right out and say her thoughts in front of rabbit its not good to have a child exposed to too much miss langley called from the bedroom why half the juveniles we have in court are there because they grew up too fast mrs mack continued stirring the cocoa the woman couldnt possibly think she preached something new the thing to do was not let them grow up at all keep them away from people who came prying looking into affairs not concerning them im fixing my baby some cocoa would you like some when the woman nodded she brought the cups from their hook and reached for the marshmallows my what handsome mugs i bet your husband carved those too the cocoa will take a while mrs mack answered rejecting the compliment she pulled a chair beside rabbit and again both of them stared at the intruder she had such pretty hair not knobby and crinkly like his mothers she wasnt even sitting near the door and it shone like his book when light fell on the pages his mother didnt like her either and she really had done nothing but walk into his room and other times she smiled at him the teeth locked together as if they guarded a big hole he dug his fingers into the arm of the chair wondering how bearlie would look covered with some of her hair he would like to take a single strand to cover bearlies gray fur then when  night came the brightness of bearlies new coat could light the darkness around his bed he could smell the cocoa feel the bubbles bursting in the pan as if the cocoa had hiccoughs then his mother poured three cups and allowed him to reach first with the cup in his hands his tongue darted out to catch a precious drop oozing down the side into his palm thank you mrs mack it really smells delicious there was silence mrs mack watched the pale fingers pick up the cup and hoped she would burn her tongue why couldnt those people leave her family alone why did they always have to come inside when they were not wanted looking with icy eyes freezing everything trying to make everybody in the world like them every last one of them made her ill how old is your son nine going on ten why mrs mack do you realize that other children his age are halfway through the fourth grade theres nothing you can teach him that will help preserve him why mrs mack we try to turn our children into useful citizens surely his heritage is worth preserving rabbit looked from one to the other two bright shining eyes peering over the cup attached to his nose we have such a good group of parents who come to our family meetings perhaps you and mr mack might come we have an indian couple who go quite regularly im sure the others wouldnt mind you two at all she smiled at rabbit and mrs macks swallow of cocoa suddenly turned cold in her mouth mrs mack said nothing she wished the woman would leave truthfully she dared not wish her away she would only return with more of her own kind bringing the sheets of paper and asking questions while one of them marked mrs macks answers in little boxes out of her head came memories of the surveyswomen from town walking through her door after barely knocking holding their noses and brushing the chairs before they sat down she would not live through that time again she would not let them force rabbit to talk in their words with their reason her son was much healthier chasing pictures inside his own head he did not need this pale woman would you like some more cocoa goodness no this cup is still so hot i can hardly drink she smiled again mrs mack looked over at rabbit sitting drowsily in his chair the cocoa had made him relax his fat palms drooping over the arms of the chair its past his naptime she said shaking rabbit gently on the shoulder come on now lets go to bed may i help you tuck him in miss langley stood and waited to follow the boy and his mother she watched mrs mack turn down the sheet and slide rabbit between the covers my what an exquisitely carved bedboard she said dont tell me more of your husbands handiwork rabbit had fallen asleep his face on the pillow as static as the ducks and squirrels on his headboard mrs mack walked from the room the social worker tippytoed behind her good miss langley whispered when they had returned to the kitchen now we can talk you never can tell what little children might overhear she smiled with half her teeth hidden  would suggest that you bring your son down to the county clinic early next week we can run some tests and if necessary enroll him in a special school why if the county has to send a social worker after you there could be all kinds of trouble mrs mack nodded watching her husband walk up the path straight to the back of miss langleys chair he walked silently accustomed to hunting small game now she watched him stop and sniff the air he could always tell when one of them was in the vicinity theyre not like us he always said they even smell different she watched him creep to the leanto on the side of the house where he stored the carving tools satisfied that she need not explain to him she turned her eyes toward miss langley my husband should be returning soon maybe you ought to talk to him at that moment mr mack walked through the door he put the bag of hazelnuts on the floor the wooden mallet he used as nutcracker was anchored on top im glad to see you mrs mack said this is miss langley she wants to bring rabbit down to the clinic and she wants us to go to some meetings miss langley turned her smile to face him she saw the heavy mallet coming down but even then her eyes did not believe he hit her four times because she was after all the fourth visitor i didnt think you were ever coming his wife said putting brown paper bags under the bodys head to catch the blood she began scrubbing the floor with soda before the stain set in the wood too bad robert had to see her he answered picking up miss langley im really sorry if id known she was here pestering you i d have come straight home he opened the screen door will you please bring the shovel its on the side of the house she finished scrubbing and carried the bucket to the porch toss ing the pail so that pink sudsy water melted into the ground they walked past the fir trees deeper into the forest preserve here he asked depositing the body on the ground she nodded and handed him the shovel at least this one is full grown she said remembering last winter when the boy with spotted glasses was lost from his hiking group he came to their door for something hot to drink cold to his toes he had said he was surprised to see people living in the middle of the woods and then mr mack knocked him unconscious dragging his body to the front yard the forest preserve was so large he knew the search party would not reach their part of the woods until morning by then he had carried the stiff body to a spot close to town the newspaper account that mr mack read said the boy apparently fell struck his head on a rock and wandered dazedly before collapsing he froze to death over night the other two did not matter they were old ladies hunting mushrooms and herbs so they said mrs mack watched her husband uncover the hole then drop the shovelfuls of dirt over the slender body completely covering the golden hair she wished he would hurry updarkness would soon catch them she had to get home and sweep the air out of the house anything she thought to remove that terrible odor before bedtime
they say that she got  ri   on the train in chii cago after transferal  ring from the dearborn station she was plump and matronly and her glasses were tinted so that she might have been a tourist seeking protection from the sun but there was neither sun nor fresh air on the train and she was very pale and very wrinkled the way clerks or indoor people grow after many years of their special protected colorless kind of life she was indeed that nondescript type of person one might be aware of but never really see in a supermarket or at a bargainbasement sale carefully and methodically fingering each item or on a busy streetcorner waiting for the light to change while others with less conscious respect for the letter of the law flowed around her she rode for a whole day before coming into the dining car for a meal she had the  special she asked for buttermilk and wanted lightbread instead of rolls the negro waiters all grinned at each other in their secret way when she finished her meal she sat reading a book and looking out at the green flatlands of north dakota until the steward had to ask her to leave so that the waiters could clean up for the next setting she did not protest but left with an indignant flourish of her dress the automatic door to the car leading to the pullman section hissed angrily behind her the steward called her a bitch between his teeth and the waiter who had served her standing next to the steward with his tray under his arm grinned broadly showing his smokestained teeth but when he saw that she had left no tip he called her a cheap bitch aloud and the steward scowled at him after the last setting the waiters sat down to eat their dinner two pullman porters came in with their coffee cans begging for handouts they were very greedy and if given one can of free coffee would always come back expectantly for more as if they had been initially granted all that they could drink they sat down at the waiters table and watched them eat the waiters were very greedy too they ate ravenously the porters watched the waiters for a while then one  of them closed his eyes and began to doze the other one an old fellow with eyes aged and tired like an owls looked out at the floating gold of the sunset across the passing wheatfields he watched until the fields became patterns of black and fading gold then he turned to the waiters we got a old southern gal back there he said we had her up here one of the waiters said between huge mouthfuls of beef she got good service but she didnt leave no tip she had me polishin her shoes the porter said but i dont reckon shell pay off when she gets off i didnt put much work out on it anyway he stretched his thin legs under the table they cracked with the sound of dead branches underfoot when it is autumn a woman in pants passed through the car her hair was cut somewhat like a little girls dutch boy and a ringlet of it curled against her cheek she blew at it out of the comer of her mouth and smiled knowingly at the men seated around the table which way to the club car she asked her lipstick was above the line of her mouth so that it looked like a red moustache she was not at all pretty and not at all young two cars ahead one waiter said she turned to go took a few steps and then looked back at the  men the two waiters were looking her over one porter was still dozing and the other tired one was seemingly not aware of her how late does it stay open she asked and she tossed her hair batted her eyes and blew on the ringlet all in the same quick movement till twelve one waiter said chicago time the other one added they watched her move through the door shell tip big tomorrow one of them said yeah that old biddy knows where the club car is she been in there all day i seen her battin them greasy eyes at john perry on the bar maybe hell take care of business for her tonight the tired pullman porter said but there was no humor in it and all of their laughs were only polite if he does shell tip big tomorrow one of the waiters said again the porter with the owl eyes pushed the dozing porter time to get the beds down tim he said tim got up slowly and they took their full coffeecans and trudged down the aisle toward the pullman section as they reached the door it opened and the lady who had transferred from dearborn came into the car the two porters stood on either side of the aisle and let her pass between them they wore white jackets with silver buttons which were engraved pullman company together with their black caps with silver plates which also read pullman company and black pants they looked like two painted black statues before the entrance to some fine suburban home she did not notice them but passed silently through the car leaving a scent of something sweet and strong when she entered the club car the woman with the dutch hair was sitting at the bar talking to john perry the bartender who stood behind the bar leaning with his arms on its waxed red surface they were very close and the dutch woman was smiling awkwardly there was no one else in the car the dearborn lady took a table near the far end of the car and began to stare at john perry as he said something low and soft and smileprovoking to the painted thing on the stool across from him the dearborn lady cleared her throat john perry placed his dark thick hand closer to the other softer hand on the bar and did not look up the painted lady made a throaty chuckle like the confusing sound one might hear near a car parked by a frog pond on a summer night i want some service the lady at the end of the car finally said ive been here for ten minutes and i want some service the man looked annoyed as he went over to her table whatll it be lady he said his voice was deep and smooth and almost as greasy as the painted womans lips and it had that familiar ring of professional servitude which is peculiar to small serving people who like their work i want a brandy a benedictine no benedictine this is a train lady she paused ill have a creme de menthe then we dont have that neither try bourbon and water honey the woman at the bar said and she lifted her glass for the lady to see he makes it very good im gonna have another one myself she looked at the bartender as she pushed a fivedollar bill across the bar make yourself one too she told him the lady at the table looked at her fiercely she finally took a rose and settled back taking turns watching the immediate reflections of the two at the bar in the window next to her face and the darkness of the passing countryside beyond their reflections the train lumbered on and it made the only noise save for an occasional giggle and a deepthroated chuckle from the bar finally the woman got up from the stool and said see you later on to the bartender she  said it with a contrived unnatural seductivity and she let her waving arm follow her out of the car the dearborn lady still seated at the table and facing the window saw it all through her tinted lenses the bartender began to whistle as he washed the glasses he was a robust fellow but he moved very gracefully behind the bar like a dancer still he splashed a great deal of water on the floor he glanced over at the lady once or twice as she in turn looked alternatively at the darkness beyond the thick window glass and at him but only her eyes moved then the man moved out from behind the bar and came toward her she stiffened and gathered her purse and got up all very quickly he was wiping the tables and whistling as she hurried out of the car    in the pullman car the porter was still making the beds he shuffled from one roomette to the next not wasting a single step the occupants came out of their rooms and stood in the hall while he swished and tucked their sheets then he knocked on the dearborn ladys door porter he barked the way a street corner concessionaire would say hot dogs there was no answer so he went in and began turning down the bed she came up behind him and watched his back as he moved about the small compartment she was breathing very hard what time do you lock the doors to the car she asked the doors aint never locked he said not turning to face her how do you keep people out my luggage is in the hall its very expensive  watch out for it i sit up all night inside the car yes mam but i we have to sleep we have to sleep in here she said she was very excited yes mam he did not stop his work nor did he look at her but answered her questions and made the bed with the proficiency and cool detachment of one used to confronting stupidity in the intelligent it was bargained and paid for in the price of her ticket and his was a patient and polite endurance of her right to be stupid im a pullman porter he said i been a pullman porter for fortythree years he had finished the bed and he smoothed down a light ripple in the red blanket his hands were rough and wrinkled and the backs of his fingers were very black fortythree years he repeated reminiscently half to himself she could not see his eyes well you cant stay in here tonight she said and moved back into the small compartment as if to possess it entirely with her presence the porter backed out its my job he said she was very nervous now and ran her hands lightly over the sides of her dress her hands stuck to the thin silk you go get the pullman conductor i can talk to him she began to pace up and down the little length of the room the porter returned in a few minutes with the pullman conductor the bluesuited conductor entered the compartment while the porter stood outside the door and watched them his dark old eyes flashing from one face to the other he sits up in the car lady the conductor said its his job he has to be here if anyone rings for him at night the conductor was very irritated he had already started to undress for bed and his tie hung loosely about his neck the lady was perspiring now and the little beads of sweat glistened on her temples in the glare of the white light overhead i cant and i wont sleep in the same car with that    that gentleman thats your business if you dont sleep lady the conductor said he stays in the car the conductor was very mad now the lines in his forehead grew very red and his nose which was large grew even larger and redder we have a right to sleep here without these people coming in doing things whats he done to you lady  hes black hes black and she said it with the exasperation and utter defeat of an inexperienced teacher whose patience has been exhausted and who can only stamp the right answer into the mind of a stupid child hes a porter the conductor said the porter who stood all the while like a child waiting for punishment seemed to droop and wither and grow smaller and his eyes which had only minutes before flashed brightly from the face of the conductor to the enraged face of the lady now seemed to dull and turn inward as only those who have learned to suffer silently can turn their eyes inward he was a very old man and he grew older even older than his occupation or the oldest and most obsequious pullman porter people were looking out of their compartments and the dearborn lady hearing them raised her voice in a plea he sleeps in here he sleeps in here with us she shouted to them down the hall the painted woman opened the door to compartment g and listened and smiled and shook her head and then closed the door again and the rest listened and weighed the thought which was a new one deserving some consideration but the conductor said that it was necessary for comfort and they agreed for the most part and returned to their rooms only the porter stood outside the door looking guilty it was finally decided that the dearborn lady would take a seat in the coaches for the night she wanted it that way the porter would sleep as he had always slept sitting up in the back of the car with his eyes closed and his mind awake and his coffee can by his side and the small bright nightlight over his bowed head and his ear next to the buzzer in case someone should ring everyone agreed that it was the way things should be it was necessary for comfort and besides it was his job and later that night when john perry the bartender who danced and splashed a great deal of water when he washed glasses stole into the dark sleeping car he paused for a minute before the bent old man on the hard porters seat the coffee can had fallen over on the seat and john perry picked it up and placed it on the floor next to the old mans feet then he knocked very softly on the door to compartment g and after a while it was opened and quickly closed behind him
in the final months of  writers assemsembled on the campuses of two predominantly negro colleges and at a conference on racism in £cetirs american education and in at least one instance the sparks flew at the american federation of teachers confab on negro history in washington novelist william melvin kelley electrified a gather ing of several hundred teachers by telling them bluntly that there is no hope for american education mr kelleys thesis developed to the obvious dismay of many of his listeners revolved around the murderous nature of american society he said that the early americans resolved to slay all the indians they could get their hands on then went on to take texas and southwest territory from the mexicans then invaded cuba and nicaragua and santo domingo and china dropped atomic bombs on japan massacred koreans and vietnamese start with a society that can rationalize genocide and slavery in the name of progress in the name of god in the name of  christianity in whatever way and then gets away with it and you will have a society that can rationalize anything at all he said the killing of one million indonesians in the name of anticommunism or the dropping of not just one but two atomic bombs america scored another firstandonly there too with all the talk about what china will do or russia will do america is the only country that has done it in the face of the fact that none of the ugly facts he had cited were ever taught in american history mr kelley said to the teachers its not your fault what you have done would be too much for any group of human beings to face so you will go on and on killing and justifying that killing    that is my view of an honest american history not a matter of hidden facts but of interpretation john henrik clarke one of the other writers on the panel writers look at history managed to shock the teachers by dismissing white teachers as being ineligible to teach negro history to black children that raised a storm of protest and mr clarke was forced to backtrack a few steps after all one of the chairmen of the program committee for the conference was a white person a young woman who has successfully taught negro history in the public schools and colleges of illinois the other two writers on the panel were novelist ronald fair many thousands gone hog butcher and critic robert a bone the negro novel in america both men dealt with the problem of historical balance mr fair from the contemporary perspective and mr bone from the historical viewpoint at alabama a  m college down near huntsville the redoubtable rosey e pool mounted the little colleges second writers conference she organized and directed the first one in  the writers on hand this time around were mostly poetssamuel allen paul vesey margaret burroughs dudley randall and mari evans who was a repeater poet margaret danner also appeared as a special guest of the threeday sessions miss pool is the anthologist and editor responsible for beyond the blues and l am the new negro a londoner by choice she is a native of holland she is an energetic traveler and teacher the fall semester at alabama a  m was her second semester there as a special member of the faculty her title this time was visiting professor of literature early this year she took off for south america the other campus conference took place at lincoln university in pennsylvania and the writers who participated were novelist john oliver killens playwrights ronald milner and loften mitchell and essayistcritic wilmer f lucas negro digest editor hoyt w fuller acted as conference moderator the lincoln conference interestingly was organized by dr charles hamilton who is chairman of the political science department and there were no members of the english department noticeably present during the conference the exceptions it should be added were two members of the conference itself mr milner who is serving as writerinresidence and mr lucas who is a visiting professor of english at both alabama and lincoln the old dilemma of art versus activism raised its gray head though somewhat wearily it was never much of an argument at alabama although it did raise a few hackles at lincoln some black writers persist in the doctrine which in essence states that they are just writers not negro writers meaning usually that they are free of the necessity of thinking of themselves as negroes their opposites feel that they protest too much that in a racist society as this one surely is a writer who exists as just a writer and not a negro writer is about as natural as a threeheaded heifer it is always interesting though that the division among the writers relative to this dilemma finds the young and youngthinking writers on the side where art and activism pose no problem of conciliation the alabama conference had the advantage of a captive audience since the appearance of the writers on the campus signalled a major event for the plenary session students from surrounding schools were bused in to hear the writers many of the students have rural backgrounds and their exposure to sophisticated writers from the nations big urban centers proved stimulating the story was somewhat different at lincoln no effort had been made to persuade the students to attend the conference in fact it was held on a saturday precisely the day when most of the students had abandoned the campus for the weekend dr hamilton indicated that this had not been inadvertent he was much more interested in having students attend the conference because they wanted to the turnout was small but enthusiastic and some very real questions were put to the writers both during the panel discussion and during the small group discussions which followed one of the amusing things revealed during the lincoln conference was the existence of an underground movement aimed at overthrowing the name of the institution certain of the students want to change the name from lincoln university to frederick douglass university after all said one of them theres a lincoln university in missouri and were willing to give them exclusive rights to the name 
last december some  to  teachers and laymen concerned with the problem of bringing view of history into american education assembled in washington for a threeday conference auspices of the american federation of teachers it was a historic event for the first time since public education was established in the nation an interracial group of educators of power and influence openly challenged the traditional approach to the teaching of american history and reolved to exert their power and influence to begin the overthrow of the traditional a virtual galaxy of cont porary scholars and historians dressed the conference on vari cp i osor of sociology at roosevelt university and sterling brown professor of english literature at howard u other speakers were ossie davis the actorplaywright and lerone bennett jr ebony magazine senior editor both of whom were conference conveners and keith baird a new york educator and haryouact official the spade work for the conference was done in chicago headquarters for the teachers union by a conference committee headed by benjamin solomon as temporary chairman the committee included arthur l reese director aft civil_rights dept carolyn reese materials chairman and sterling stuckey and beatrice young program chairmen other members of the conference committee were lydia lewis publicity william simons host chairman sidney harris attendance and bernard flicker and margaret s webb resolutions a bonus feature of the conference was an opening night general session on writers look at history the writers were novelists ronald fair and william melvin kelley critic robert a bone and editoressayist john henrik clarke and their perspective on history and the problem of adjusting it proved more than a little provocative kelley for example stated flatly there is no hope for american education panel discussions organized with the presence of consultants followed the major addresses and suggested resolutions were invited from all participants in the conference in the end the conference passed a resolution calling for the discarding or boycotting of all textbooks which neglect or distort the role of afroamericans in the history of the nation it did not simply resolve to do this the conference also provided those in attendance with materials and sources of materials which could help them in achieving the task of redressing the balance of history in school texts the conference was held at the washington hilton hotel
