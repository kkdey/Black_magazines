many of the stereotypes still prevailing about negroes in this country can be traced through books of various kinds written from the middle of the th century to the beginning of the civil war this proslavery antinegro writing made its impact in spite of the mass of literature written against slavery one can only say that it is unfortunate that through books the peculiar institution of slavery was strengthened the writers of these books were just as much a part of the conspiracy as the slave holders although the term slave was not applied to the negro in the early decades of the settlement of this nation the fact remains that the colonists looked upon the negro servant slave and even free man as inferiors oscar handlin documents the fact that although slavery was not legally fixed until around  the institution of slavery nevertheless was in existence and in looking at the literature of colonial america one will find it explicit colonial writers viewed negroes as inferior and different many of them said yes inculcate piety so as to save the black mans soul but remember he will never be equal cotton mather that great new england puritan certainly wanted to christianize the negro but ironically he nevertheless assumed the negros incapacity for freedom john woolman the quaker minister in an antislavery pamphlet stated the blacks seem far from being kinfolk and they are of vile stock yet woolman was a champion of converting and manumitting negroes he offered an ingenious defense of converting slaves conversion would serve as a measure of control thomas paine and thomas jefferson demonstrated their thoughts on the subject of the equality of black men in their writings perhaps jeffersons philosophy is the most glaring incongruity of all when comparing the slave in this country with the roman slave in his notes on virginia  he stated that among the romans emancipation required but one effort the slave when made free might mix without straining the blood of the master but with us a second is necessary unknown to history when freed he is to be removed beyond the reach of mixture jefferson went on to prove his point about the distinctions between black and white men by concluding that nature not slavery produced the distinctions he injected a pseudobiological basis into the  argument when he stated besides those of color figure and hair there are other physical distinctions proving differences of race they blacks have less hair on the face and body they secrete less by the kidneys and more by the glands of the skin which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odor jefferson like woolman advocated manumission of the slaves but also in the same breath he suggested returning them to africa for this manumission this ambiguous attitude towards negroes was in fact the basis of condescension among so called colonial liberals and even much later the separate but equal theory negroes know so well today there were those writers who felt the racial barrier had to be strengthened in the colonies particularly since slaves were learning to speak english and were becoming christians which of course was a threat of cultural assimilation some wrote popular tracts which were widely read on the negro being inferior because of his life in africa which inferred the worship of snakes and exotic objects this theme of the negros inferiority and godlessness persisted in books as late as charles carrols notorious the negro a beast or in the image of god which was published in  during the last decades of the th century americans began to write novels as would be expected the first novels were heavily influenced by the novelists of england and had little concern for the realities of life in this country whenever a negro character appeared he was a shadowy figure looming in the background only a few writers attempted to attack slavery in their novels and unfortunately their works were not read widely in the north and certainly much less if at all in the south after  and prior to the civil war there were those writers who included negro characters but described them as the mammy with the bright varicolored turban spotless apron and eversmiling face the uncle and the banjoplaying minstrel of the plantation slavery was depicted as benevolent and necessary for a childlike peoples transition from savagery to christianity these writers were convinced that the brutality of slavery existed only in the minds of fanatical yankees because the southerner was of a gentler breed sterling brown stated it accurately when he said that the writers of the plantation tradition felt that the grownup slaves were contented the pickinnies were frolicking the steamboat was hooting around the bend god was in heaven and all was right with the world the proslavery writers had as their model j p kennedys novel swallow barn  a poorly written work which could be classed as a modest best seller of that day kennedy depicts negroes as clowns essentially parasitical and happy as long as the meddling abolitionists left them alone it is interesting to note that many of the kennedytype novels were written by women one northern woman writer married to a southerner celebrated the mammy she had her leading character comment to her husband oh my husband i never dreamed that slavery could present an aspect so tender and affectionate in this work the husbands slaves are shown as fat sleek and full of laughter on sunday at church they are attired in the latest fashions another writer a mrs eastman wrote a bestseller that was popular among the women on the pantation entitled aunt phyliss cabin  the book glorifies slavery and denounces abolitionists all of this of course for the slaves welfare one observer of the women writers of the plantation tradition noted that they were too kind to mistreat slaves but nevertheless tarred and feathered and even lynched their characters who were abolitionists indeed a study of the proslavery women writers of that day would be very revealing harriet beecher stowes uncle toms cabin  created a mild sensation when it appeared in the three years that followed miss stowes publication there were at least  novels published to counteract it w l g smiths life in the south or uncle toms  cabin as it is  is typical of the antistowe novels which appeared in smiths parody uncle tom is urged to run off to canada by abolitionists upon reaching canada he is placed in slavery again he begs his master to return him to the south which was done out of christian consideration it is inaccurate to suggest that all white authors wrote in an attempt to dehumanize the negro we did have such writers as washington irving and herman melville to name a few irving was a young brisk manabouttown and he recorded his curiosity about the negro in knickerbocker history of new york  there is the negro character caesar who perhaps is the first comic negro in american fiction however he is comic in strictly a human sense and crafty and quickwitted as well herman melville has his character pip in moby dick  characterized as a coward not because he is black but because he is naturally human in benito cereno  we see the noble slave babo plan a revolt aboard a slave ship off the coast of chile babo is shown as a hero and a natural leader other slaves are shown as men willing to fight for their freedom they revolted as mankind has always revolted when subjugated james fenimore cooper has a negro character in the spy  who is courageous and in the pioneers  he characterizes abraham as a robust free  black man who actively takes part in the life of the frontier in his last of the mohicans  cora the negro woman is shown as a strong and resourceful character it should be mentioned that prior to the civil war the first novel by a negro was published william wells brown wrote clotei or the presidents daughter  browns work was followed by frank webbs the garies and their friends  and martin delaney followed webbs work several years later with blake or the huts of america  these three novels are noteworthy because they were written by black men at a time when whites were saying that negroes were incapable of learning and in the words of jefferson are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind as can be seen then there were writers prior to  who were sympathetic towards the negro and his condition but there were too many writers who were in favor of slavery and who never became convinced that the negro was an equal american literature reveals that these early writers exerted all of their energies in perpetuating the peculiar institution through books wherein the civil war was fought and the slaves emancipated the antinegro books made so great an impact that we are still faced with the consequences of their prejudices which were passed on through the printed word
and this too could have y y been a paean but cons y  r tradictions abound in  our history and there are historical discontinuities fortunately we are constantly inevitably moved moved by the haunting memory of minutes measured in drops of pawned manhood or by the centuriesold whip like a mule desperate bobbingandweaving uphill on this slippery road possessed with frenzied rhythms of passionate desire to grasp this historical moment and redefine man in order to keep moving with clarity so now i want to talk about somebody most of us are familiar with the young selfavowed black revolutionary artist and intellectual he says he has read marx engels lenin guevara mao nkrumah du bois frantz fanon he says he has looked into negritude and though he was somewhat moved and sympathetic he came back with a frown he likes leroi jones plays because they run the crap down like it really is this young man knows about the nature of revolutions and counterrevolutions the world over and is never hesitant to express his hostility to the western world he is so disillusioned with western values he claims that he will never ever trade in his retrieved soul rhythmic reasoning for the western analytic sensibility the upholders and defenders of western christian civilization kill lumumba and his heart bleeds the upholders and defenders of western christian democratic ideals put kaunda kenyatta sobukwe mandela and countless others in jail and his heart bleeds the upholders and defenders of western christian morality kill millions of people in vietnam latin america africa and america and his heart bleeds he probably wishes he had builtin bombs to mow down all these devils that shows a lot of potential but potential which remains potential does not help alleviate or solve anybodys problems potential has to grow and the fruits of that potential have to be realizable in very concrete terms as a way of life hence my accusation i accuse the selfavowed young revolutionary artist and intellectual of negligence  or irresponsibility should i say it might even be downright cowardice let me point out here that in ioparticular i am talking about the young afroamerican and the young south african artist and intellectual  for a number of reasons in most cases artists from colonial countries have grown up in a notsohighly industrialized urban society the south african and the afroamerican are from highly industrialized societies run by racist capitalist exploiters and judeochristian ethics at all stages of his training right from kindergarten on up the values of the colonized were are systematically destroyed by the oppressor the young colonial subject is trained to look down upon everything that is his he is trained to aspire to the colonialists ideals and to emulate the oppressor his heroes artistic and historical are colonialist the success of the colonialists damaging of our minds is reflected for instance when a young colonial subject watches an american cowboy movie he finds himself without knowing why identifying positively with the white plunderer he even sees the indian who is fighting in defense of his person and his land as the villain by the time he is through the masters college he is so whitewashed and westernoriented he might as well have had a grecoroman ancestry but as much of european culture as he assimilates he finds himself still a nigger in the eyes of the oppressor exceptional maybe or different but still a nigger to the oppressor this frustrates him and he begs the oppressor to accept him for he is ashamed to go back to his people because he looks down upon them the african in what the oppressor calls the underdeveloped countrymeaning that his country is not western christian industrialized that the people there do not worship the dollar the pound or the franc and the bombdoes not have our hangups he has never mistaken himself for a carboncopy noball whiteman his identity has never been questionable thus what we are faced with demands more discipline more tearing apart of the rot in our minds and very conscious planning the oppressor is not going to say all right fm sorry i was so inhuman when we decide we have had enough of his nonsense he will be more repressive and he will kill us any time we say his game is over anybody who thinks the oppressor will take his hold off our throats when we say it hurts lives under a criminal illusion first the oppressor throws christ and that gloryafterdeath bull on you when that ceases to work he throws money on you or a separate development plan or a civil_rights bill and selects your leaders for you he will pass laws to proscribe whatever you attempt to do if it is not in line with what he prescribes when that fails he throws a bomb on you ask the vietnamese people or any people involved in national liberation wars it is at this point that history calls upon us to try the best we can to fulfill our mission we owe it to the generations that will come after us we owe it to the dead of sharpeville watts and the harlems around the world we owe it to malcolm fanon and the rest of suffering humanity it is at this point that we must clearly realize that our problems are not going to be solved in conference rooms the fight is going to be bloody and our art if it is valid is going to be carved from that portion of history it is going to reflect explore and celebrate the nature of that blood condemnation alone spills no liberatory blood at best condemnation without action remains a tensionreleasing mechanism but people trained under fascist savagery to be so afraid settle for the least bit of comfort but that fear too like all western references must bleed to death all these years our passion and desires have been lying dormant like animals in hibernation or like leafless trees between the winter and the summer not dried up and dead but alive and waiting for the spring to blossom our spring has  been here too long and im afraid imperialist floods might ruin us before we bear fruit if we linger here too long but still terror reigns in the mind we are so full of fear where is the decolonized mind many of us realize that the attempt to establish a collective expression of a constructive revolutionary program a pulling together of our heads to work out a new system of values and an unconditional assertion of those valuesnational and international in scopecalls for discipline and responsibility of duty we are afraid to shoulder this responsibility as a result we do not even totally reject the oppressors values we rationalize we become dishonest we are never hesitant to proclaim our identification with the people but our identification remains strictly theoretical because there are no acts to give our statements substance we make an art and claim it is the peoples art but that is questionable it seems as paternalistic a gesture as that of the white liberal the liberal never hesitant to make statements about how justifiable our fight against racist domination is is not willing to fight by any means necessary against oppression and i am afraid the attitude of some people who claim to be black artists is similar to that of the liberal recently i asked a group of colleagues if they believed most of our art was truly with the people  theres a thing like selling black you know and it seems like its a commodity very much in demand in liberal circles one of them replied man dont be so naive you still think them niggers is worth dying for please note that this attitude is not representative but it exists among people who write what they never hesitate to call black poetry then there are those who do not do much more than talk about or quote marx if that is one of the best things we can do for our liberation we are in bad shape look i do not have anything against marx in fact i like him he is one of the few europeans who tried to make the white sensibility human for those selfstyled nationalists who are as antisocialist as the oppressor let me point out here that there is a difference between socialist political and economic theory and the historical sellingout of known communistsi mean cardcarrying ones every nation in the world today which rejects western racist ideologies operates from a socialist economic and political base what we have to clearly realize though is that for the solution of our problems conventional marxism is inadequate we do not have a class problem this does not mean that there is no black bourgeoisie but they do not have any kind of power in decisionmaking bodies which have shoved us where we are they are insignificant toolsshowcase stooges for the oppressor to use in defense of his sinister ways if we had a purely class problem    if poverty was the major problem to be solved in a rich country like america or south africa the poor regardless of color or race would necessarily have been reasonably united and fighting together to eliminate poverty but our problem is both economic and racial at the same time and these two are so intertwined that we do not know which one is really the cause of the other and it does not matter what is abundantly clear is that we are colonized and exploited by white peopleall of them western christian racist and even the white worker a little pawn without imagination benefits from this thus class exploitation is not similar to racial domination and exploitation and marx developed theories and strategy to guide and attempt to humanize precapitalist europe but even he did not spend all his time theorizing his peoples problems he was not afraid he was out there organizing and mobilizing those forces to get the revolution off the ground where is our program of action the salvation of the world we now clearly know lies in the destruction of the power of the western world it lies in the establishment of a system of values hostile to any manner of exploitation oppression and the domination of one race by another race or one nation by another nation this calls for an understanding of the world we live in and a clear vision of the world we want to construct this calls for collective planning our lack of planning programs of action and establishing revolutionary social institutions renders us weak as a group and i say lumumba got killed because of our collective weakness mandela and sobukwe and thousands of others are in jails immobilized because of our collective weakness brother malcolm was assassinated at the beginning of his revolutionary maturity because of our collective weakness countless other perverted atrocities are continually perpetrated on us because of our collective weakness brothers what i am driving at is for instance the following if our historical enemynow practically our natural enemyhad known that should anything have happened to brother malcolm_x there would have been chaos in harlem that night that the following day there wouldnt have been a single whiteowned store on th street that the very foundations of this system would have had to cope with a black uncontrollable power the chances are that brother malcolm would still be with us i do not accuse the group of wanting to be ownedeven remotely psychologicallyby imperialist forces i believe that we would rather die than be weak and enslaved in whatever form modernday slavery is practiced i believe that we want to live in a world with a new order of things a new image of man loving love loving life feeling and really living instead of being perverted with material values i believe that we all no longer want any stupid iffy concessions from liberals who are essentially in sympathyand collaboratewith the forces we want to destroy for the survival of humanity we know the aspirations and the needs of the people because if we are not just maladjusted western artists with black faces mere carboncopy whitemen our consciousness and collective conscience find direction from the throbbing of the peoples collective heart of course the people are not always right hence the absolute necessity for institutions that would guide the development of their values if we have this consciousness and we are moved by our conscience as men in search of a new order of things we will realize that the frustrated opportunistic dishonest white lefts anticapitalist whimpering is not our problem i believe it is time for us to stop and check ourselves out thoroughly and as leroi jones said    you might surprise yourself right out the window we are preoccupied if we are  sincere not necessarily with the atrocities of the western world but with turning the world into a better place for human habitation we feel and think as we do only because we now believe that we are inherently more interested in humanity than in the material values of the white western world this does not mean that we have not killed men and raped women but our historical experience is such that since we came into contact with the white sensibility the concentration of our efforts our attempt as a race to live has boiled down to means of survival however right now we are not concerned with what we might have been but with what we will be we clearly understand that we are at war we have always been at waronly for so long we pretended that we did not clearly realize we were now we clearly realize also that whether we fight back or not the enemy continues to molest us there are some mature artists and intellectuals around unfortunately their growth is mainly personal virtually divorced from the masses of the people though forever given momentum by the peoples collective desire for liberation in this aspect of our development our acts the constant broadening of our consciousness of the world we live in our psychological liberation have been mainly personal because we have not developed a body of thought an ideology to determine our collective behavior a firm uncompromising stand as a liberatory vehicle the people must know what is going on and what can be done this means we should be prepared to analyze situations and help to clarify the peoples vision when johnson comes out and threatens remember theres only ten per cent of you    we must clarify the implications of that move to the people a speech at a rally or an article in a magazine will not do this we have to establish institutions which will facilitate the political education of the people where our strategies can be mapped out and then there is the crucial question of symbols the symbols that the majority of the people relate to have been created by the oppressor to ensure our psychological captivity we must create more relevant symbols that the peoples development of a system bols that will intensify the peoples determination to be free politically economically and psychologically symbols that will facilitate the peoples development of a system of thought which will enable them to readily see through the oppressors strategies so that we will not be caught offguard again as it so damned frequently happens our awareness of where we are historically demands this responsibility of us finally i think our method at this historical moment as a group is bankrupt our literature and the arts i believe should be the solid coil around our collective desire and method make no mistake there is some beautiful poetry around some beautiful music and the rest of the arts too but the people do not know this the people do not read they are too busy at the grind trying to make it perhaps even if they read at this stage of our development they would not recognize the beauty because of the symbols they have been trained to relate to and poetry is not enough it is not and has never been because of a lack of poetry song or dance that we are in our present condition
somewhere tucked £ away in the recesses of  £ my being is a hazy § e memory as time has passedi have occa sionally reflected on this reminiscence and wonder whether it is a dream or an altered childhood fanft tasy with all of us the passage of time makes dreams fantasy and reality blur and mix so that our memories are a coalescence of what was what we longed for and what we were afraid of i recall a time when i was approximately nine our minister announcing that at the end of the service the next week a mr rasmussen would have a few words to say ours was the colored methodist episcopal church in los angeles in later years to further an identity search and discard an outmoded image the church changed its name to christian methodist episcopal following the announcement by our pastor there was a general buzzing in the church i became aware that mr rasmussen was white and heard mutterings that it was election time in keeping with the practices then current he was expected to give an innocuous talk and the adults in the congregation were subsequently expected to go out and vote for him except in rare circumstances no one in the church would see him again until his next political campaign our visitor would stay for just a few minutes and then visit other branches of the church in south los angeles south los angeles was an euphumism for watts which even then was the last district on the agenda of any politician in those days and i imagine even now all the children sat in the balcony or loft of the church there we could sleep pass notes and from our lofty perch make judgments on the presumed sinners in the congregation below i still cringe as i recall the minister stopping in midsermon to admonish the children to be quiet for us the voice of god himself could not have been more frightening or commanding after the announcement of mr rasmussens forthcoming visit i vaguely hoped he would not come i was uncomfortable at the thought of his observing our congregation if our pastor was in good form there was a possibility that sister tyler would get happy or that someone might get carried away with amens sister tyler was our barometer indicating whether a sermon really swung or not on some sundays the large dark lady sang vigorous solos she was resplendent in her robe and her mobile face and body conveyed her mood as much as her voice she was able to control the congregation in accompanying any speaker often punctuating the preachers message with short replies if he began to really move she served as a catalyst for the entire congre gation to pour out their feelings and shout while we could get happy among ourselves i was uncomfortably aware even at that age that we could never let white people observe us carrying on the next week was one of tremendous excitement and anticipation for me several times i went to bed and drifted off to sleep only to be awakened by a nightmare in which sister tyler had indeed gotten happy jumped up and yelled and fallen prostrate to the floor as in the past the ushers came up with their fans and placed magic potions under her nose but this time the good sister continued her assault on the devil by jumping up and starting the whole sequence over again i could never reconcile the ambivalence of getting happy in church with being joyful in that there was always much crying handclapping and body writhing accompanying the former my mother once spent all of a summer talking me out of a youthful concept that when sister tyler got happy she was really quite angry the nightmares continued all week long until sunday arrived i could hardly wait for sunday school to end so the service could proceed we had the various offerings and songs followed by the sermon mr rasmussen was to appear at the end of the service our minister seemed particularly slow that day dragging the service on and on by the time mr rasmussen actually appeared my dreadful anticipations had left me so emotionally spent that i heard only a small part of his very brief speech he came in through a side door and immediately began to vigorously shake the hand of our pastor after the introduction he began to talk in a low voice and kept referring to himself as your friend occasionally his head would nod back and forth and i vividly recall seeing a single white face silhouetted in front of the choir while the details of that face have long since fled my memory many of the feelings experienced during that day have remained from a seat in the balcony i had gotten upstairs early to be assured of a front row i looked down at the congregation sister tyler was serene and relaxed with a masklike face influenced by her the other ladies were also sitting quietly the only overt signs of any feelings were occasional nods of the head more perfunctory and habitual than anything else i have often reflected on my week of painful expectation mr rasmussen came and spoke and left for watts i wondered what he did when he was not making speeches did he have any children did they go to church i felt he did not know us and we did not know him the minister had not sounded like himself when he introduced the guest no one had gotten happy all of us had held back and i perceived that mr rasmussen had also held back i wondered if he would make the same speech in watts and if he would know the people there any better or if they would know him something had been missing in us when mr rasmussen came and i felt sure something had been missing in him also we did not know ourselves in the presence of each other at first this realization was one of relief later it was pain i one of the most significant and disturbing problems of contemporary america is the continuing and as yet unsuccessful effort to delineate a national identity in our sloganeering culture this effort has been characterized as a quest for identity writers discussing this search have had many and at times conflicting views but the concept of identity itself has remained an important one identity now appears as a central idea among people of the modern world from peoples all over the globe the word is heard to describe the highest ambitions of men in some unifying manner the patriot in africa the slum dweller in rio de janeiro and many people in this country all appear to be making the same appeals new national entities such as kenya and established ones such as france all use the term to exhort their people to more eloquent heights erik erikson the foremost student of identity defines the term simply an identity provides the ability to experience oneself as something that has continuity and sameness and to act accordingly he was the first social scientist to relate man to an environment that was both internal and external only after the contributions of erikson did we begin to take into account how a mans caste and class influenced so totally his thoughts about himself a healthy identity encompasses basic thoughts that one has about his body and sex parental love and admonitions which have been effectively assimilated an important aspect of a viable identity is the capacity to perceive oneself as something having a past present and future in short a personal historical sense this is seldom conscious but more a subtle awareness that one has alternatives and can make choices the familiar adolescent crisis is our most visible example of an individual groping for identity as adolescents make the transition from dependence and reliance on others to independence and selfsufficiency there can be many outward evidences of change some of these are delicate and barely noticed and some are explosive and frenzied for an individual to achieve completeness and the ability to give and receive mature love then many basic questions surrounding identity must be resolved contrary to popular misconception these are rarely if ever accomplished by asking who am i outside the offices of psychiatrists or the imaginations of philosophers few people ask themselves this question they may unknowingly pursue an identity adopting or discarding several but the question is invariably asked inwardly the question manifests itself with patterns of thought or by feelings and behavior but seldom by open conscious questions another important consideration is that an individual is never without an identity it may be hated devalued and despised but it is present nevertheless in this context the negro in this country has always had an identity namely that of an anomalous black man in a white mans country one of his core problems remains the assimilation of his blackness into the white american identity he has been seen as a person of sorts but not as a whole man with a full range of choices of central importance here is the following concept where expression of ones identity has been denied one of the dangerous paths open is the seizure of identity through destructive action
the article on a philip  f ir  randolph portrait of   £ an afroamerican d radical by john henrik clarke ne gro digest march  raises serious questions about the way our history is treated in the popular press although mr clarkes purpose in writing this piece was ostensibly to present a brief sketch of what went into the making of an afroamerican radical it so happens that radicals such as mr randolph do not make history solely according to the dictates of their own personal designs such leaders are also shaped molded and propelled by social forces outside of and beyond themselves hence it is impossible to get an understanding of a radical fortyodd years after his beginnings by telling only what he accomplished we have a right to also know some of his failures and at least a hint of what outside trends and forces during his career made for both his successes and his failures mr clarke failed to do this although he could very well have a philip randolph is one of the more outstanding leaders in the th century history of the american negro this is emphasized in order to separate the th from the th century this is done because the most serious weakness in the outlook of the negro civil_rights niques is blunted by racial realities in america the militants are in serious trouble they are forced to retrench behind slogans like black_power etc and to formulate new programs for action there is very little understanding here that as leaders and activists this new militant breed of the s is nothing but a conmovement in all its factions is that most of the new leaders and ideologists have very little understanding of the negro movements th century beginnings and the mixture of ingredients that went into those beginnings this ignorance of the th century is most glaring in the socalled militant nationalist black_power wing of the negro movement once the effectiveness of militant direct action tech tinuation or repetition of similar trends issues slogans and programs brought to life from  to the s the very period which produced a man like a philip randolph our movements for freedom equality liberation emigration separation integration and even migration from one state to another section are th century movements they have only the most tenuous historical connections with th century trends of frederick douglass and others yet there is a persistent belief in articulate negro circles that our present day movements are traceable back to precivil war slavery emancipation reconstruction etc but this is true only in a historical romantic sense we honor a frederick douglass in this historical sense but all that douglass stood for and fought for in postcivil war reconstruction was washed away by southern bourbon restoration of the s and s douglass died in  during the very decade when the united states became an openly aggres sively imperialist nation in its war against spain in cuba and the philippines when america became imperialistic in foreign policy the relationship of the negro to american society changed character and became something else not experienced by frederick douglass and the leaders of his heyday the negro was still committed to struggling for the same objectives as douglass had but under radically changed social economic political and cultural conditions it was for these reasons that the s and early s produced two entirely new leaders in the person of booker t washington and w e b du bois who came into mutual conflict over program in a way that douglass never had to experience with his own black contemporaries over slavery and emancipation thus the th century produced the movements the leaders the trends the ideas the conflicts which formed the historical and organizational beginnings to which our current  movements are heirs from  to  we had washingtons tuskegee movement in  we had du boiss niagara movement which helped establish the naacp in  in  the urban league was formed and a few years later began the greatest mass migration in american history of the negro out of the south into the north in the meantime the american socialist party had attracted a corps of negro intellectuals of whom a philip randolph was one of the most outstanding the messenger magazine which he edited along with chandler owen was a black socialist organ which grew out of the hotel messenger which randolph had founded in  in  the american communist movement was established following the russian revolution of  as a result certain negro socialists associated with randolph on his messenger broke with the socialists to become communists randolph however remained a socialist and became an anticommunist thus there developed a bitter political feud between randolph and certain of his former socialist colleagues in the communist party which lasted from the s into the s and beyond a philip randolph emerged as a socialist leader just prior to the time marcus garvey established his nationalistic back to africa movement in harlem after having failed to set it up in jamaica british west indies there developed a bitter feud not only between randolphs messenger group and the garveyites but also a fight between the garveyites and the very same excolleagues of randolphs who had become communists there was also a violent polemical conflict between marcus garvey and du boiss naacp at the same time the young writers on randolphs messenger were criticizing w e b du bois as an old leader from the old school who no longer spoke for the new negro this was the same thing du bois had told booker t washington about  years earlier when he revolted against booker ts conservative economic nationalism with the niagara movement what was going on here in the s negro movements it was a fateful clash between naacp civil_rightsism garvey nationalism negro socialism negro communism plus black trade unionism when randolph launched his brotherhood of sleeping car porters organizing drive in  then to add to this wild conflict of black politics and economics came the provocative and as yet illunderstood question of cultural consciousness of the negro renaissance movement which produced langston hughes paul robeson claude mckay countee cullen etc and the jazz age the grass roots ferment underlying all of this provocative social ferment was the mass migration into new york of southern negroes and west indians the west indian character of the garvey movement spawned a clash between west indians and american negroes over group social values leadership priorities and accommodation to the ways of life in american northern cities the attacks on garveyism emanating from randolphs messenger and du boiss naacp took on an antiwest indian flavor and garvey saved his choicest blasts for du bois yet the facts are that behind the scenes garveys most effective enemies the ones who had him jailed were west indians all of these and more were the basic ingredients that went into the formation of the th century negro movement we know today and every single one of these issues are still with us only in a more complex and exaggerated form what we are dealing with in todays civil_rights movement are the unsolved problems not of the s but of the s it was against such a background that a philip randolph started the brotherhood of sleeping car porters but for mr clarke to merely cite the opposition of the pullman company against randolphs efforts is of little crucial importance today everybody knows that industry management was always antilabor whether white or black what is more important for us is an insight into randolphs personal socialist politics before he started organizing porters for example who were some of the other prominent negro socialists randolph was allied with why were they so critical of the politics of w e b du bois clarkes freedomways magazine is a very produ bois publication but in  randolphs messenger said that du boiss conception of politics is strictly opportunist within the last six years he has been democrat socialist and republican he must said the messenger editorially make way for the new radicalism of the new negro during the same period several of randolphs socialist colleagues around the messenger broke with the socialist party and joined the newly formed communist party movement they became the pioneer negro communists of the s it is important for us to know why randolph refused to become a communist himseff while some of his friends did randolph always remained an anticommunist at least two of randolphs former s friends are still alive and one of them even writes for freedomways occasionally in view of the fact that w e b du bois finally joined the communist party in  some  years after it was formed and in view of the fact that freedomways is produ bois how can mr clarke as a freedomways editor call randolph a radical what was the precise difference between du boiss radicalism and randolphs radicalism the communists of the s looked with disfavor upon randolphs organizing of the pullman porters into a separate allblack union none of randolphs exnegro socialist friends who had become communists supported randolph in his efforts to organize the porters why did they take this attitude during the same periodrandolphs messenger said editorially that negro communists were a menace why did randolph believe this what about randolphs relationship with the garvey movement it is a fact that randolphs messenger writers were implacable enemies of the garvey movement in  the messenger attacks on the garvey movement were so bitter that a w a domingo one of randolphs exfriends among the negro socialists wrote a letter of protest accusing the messenger of being antiwest indian domingo had quit the messenger as a staff writer because of randolphs handling of the garvey question domingo complained who are the bitterest enemies and most persistent opponents of garvey arent they west indians     w a domingo was antigarvey randolph was antigarvey and the communists were antigarvey and garvey was particularly anticommunist but what was garveys attitude towards randolphs organizing of the pullman porters this question is no longer crucial for garveyism today since garveyism is no longer an important force however it is still important relative to the communists because the enmity between randolph and the communist party has been an everlasting fact mr clarke however must pass over many of these facts as if they were not important but they are not only must we review all these historical trendsgarvey nationalism black socialism black communism black trade unionism black civil_rightsism etcwe must also have some historical understanding of why all these factions were at each others political throats what were they really fighting over consider mr clarkes treatment of randolphs role in the organizing of the national negro congress clarke gives us a long quotation from randolphs speech at the  founding convention of the nnc in which he optimistically accepted the presidency of the new organization but mr clarke has nothing to say about why randolph quit the nnc four years later he quit because the national negro congress very quickly came under the control of the communist party and randolph the radical did not go along with the communist takeover again randolph clashed with the communists as he had back in the s why this conflict according to one historian of this period randolph quit the national negro congress because the nnc was now nothing more than an enlarged communist party cell he knew that to continue in office would mean acceptance of a program which he could not endorse in principle he knew too that it would mean serving as a stooge for the party bureaucrats and their errand boy who now firmly held the reins of all the governing committees randolph stated his own reasons for quitting the presidency of the nnc in the new york times of april   the national negro congress should be dependent on resources supplied by the negro people alone the grounds for my belief is that history shows that where you get your money you also get your ideas and control  e franklin frazier writing of the national negro congress meeting of  said the large attendance of whites in  was the result it was reported of the influence of the communist party    when one considers the diverse interests that were represented in the organizations officially affiliated with the national negro congress it is obvious that its unity and solidarity rested upon a precarious basis from the beginning these were some of the facts concerning randolph and the national negro congress thus for mr clarke to contend that the nnc was a forerunner of presentday civil_rights groups such as the congress of racial equality core and the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc is a gross distortion of historical fact core started in  as an independent nonpolitical noncommunist affiliated civil_rights group while sncc started in the sixties as a studentyouth movement under youth leadership the nnc was certainly not a youth group how can a historian as experienced as clarke make such shallow and inaccurate comparisons the nnc was a product of the severe economic depression of the s plus the ciolabor organizing upsurge that distinguished this period it was a product of its times and had little in common with the issues of the s except civil_rights which has always been with us through the lean years and the fat lastly comes mr clarkes glowing account of randolphs role in organizing the famous move for his march on washington of  the threat of this march caused president roosevelt to issue his renowned executive order  establishing the presidents committee on fair employment practices committee fepc this order was effective in outlawing racial discrimination in war defense industries randolph then called off the intended march on the capital having achieved his aims but here again it is important to note that none other than the communist party randolphs antagonist since the s was in opposition to this march on washington in fact both the communist party and randolphs former organization the national negro congress were against randolphs march on washington movement the reasons for this opposition were too complicated to be analyzed here but they were based mainly on the communist partys enmity over randolphs undisputed influence in the negro community which the communists tried mightily to undermine the historian quoted earlier wrote some of the most vitriolic attacks ever leveled by the communist party at a negro organization were visited upon the march on washington during this period if it was mr clarkes intent to merely write a laudatory piece on a philip randolph as the dean of negro leaders that is his privilege yet clarke is a historian and more is demanded of a historian today mr clarke however succeeds in lifting randolph out of too much of the social context that is pertinent to our understanding of what made randolph what he is and was randolph as a leadership personality was molded by a great conflict of th centurytrends that emerged between  and the s it was practically these trends which created the th century negro struggle in all its complexity the negro movement in all of its aspects we know today are nothing but a continuation of those early trends on another level anyone who does not understand these early trends cannot grasp what is wrong with the negro movement today the negro civil_rights movement is in a serious crisis now therefore it is necessary that the entire th century development of leadership trends must be researched analyzed and reevaluated from booker t washington to du bois to randolph to garvey to robeson to elijah muhammad down to malcolm_x and even adam clayton powell for without such a thorough going reevaluation and reinterpretation all such slogans as black_power remain empty talk this should be the objective of all history writing today especially about leaders oddly enough the editorial of mr clarkes freedomways magazine for fall  supports the freedom budget another of randolphs achievements it says the freedom budget proposals have the support of all of the major organizations in the negro freedom movement although a philip randolph guided the preparation and publication of this budget freedomways does not mention him in the editorial
we the members of the students afroamerip can society realize the need to comprehend more fully our perspective and our roles both as negroes and as members of the society in which we live we form this organization seeking to unite and utilize the resources and experiences of the students of columbia university in order that we may achieve a greater understanding of the complexity of racial problems in america thus states the preamble of the constitution of an organization which appears destined to play an important role in the future of the human rights struggle in the united states that organization is the students afroamerican society sas of columbia university this society of afroamerican students founded in  by hilton clark son of the noted psychologist dr kenneth clark has one of the largest memberships of which  are activeof several such societies which have sprung up on the ivy league campuses it is an example of a new much needed and muchwelcome trend of group identification which is developing among black students on prestigious ivy league campuses for many years and in most instances rightfully so black ivy leaguers have been accused of practicing a genteel uncle thomasism the chief purpose of which was to achieve individualistic material prosperity without a second thought to the wellbeing of their fellow afroamericans this tendency has severely hurt the overall progress of the human rights movement for it meant that afroamericans as a group were denied the benefit of skills that these highlytrained group members possessed with little if any group identification they felt no sense of group responsibility on december   sas hosted the first intercollegiate conference of afroamerican students according to robert belt a senior government major at columbia college and current president of the columbia group the purpose of the conference was to examine the role afroamerican college students should play in the black revolution and their responsibility both individually and collectively to the civil_rights effort also according to mr belt the conference hoped to encourage the formation of afroamerican student societies at other universities and colleges and to lay the groundwork for the eventual federation of these groups into a nationwide association of afroamerican students among the schools represented at the conference were harvard yale princeton mt holyoke radcliffe barnard and vassar delegates also came from howard university and morehouse college speakers at the conference included james farmer former national director of the congress of racial equality core ivanhoe donaldson of the students nonviolent coordinating committee sncc roy innis president of harlem core floyd mckissick current president of national core and james meredith when asked by this writer to give their opinion as to the chief significance of the conference farmer replied that the chief significance is that at long last black students have overcome their fear of associating with other black students the students gathered here are wrestling with the major debates of the civil_rights movement and we need their minds in those debates innis said it gives me a chance to meet a good crosssection of the young black students and to sample their thinking this group is extremely important because like it or not they are future leaders and it is my job to try to influence them as much as possible in the interests of black people we have to compete with the enemy for their allegiance mckissick felt that it had brought afroamerican students together from all over the east this will benefit the cause of black_power and should hasten the end of uncle  thomasism to meredith the very occurrence of the conference was the chief significance most meetings of black students have been for purely social purposes and the fact that they have met together for such serious purposes is the utmost importance donaldson of sncc told the students that it was important that they use the knowledge and skills gained in the prestigious universities not just for narrow individual attainment but as a means to help improve the nationwide and worldwide position of their group mckissick innis and donaldson also warned the students to    beware of greeks bearing gifts they told them that the white power structure would expect payment for the honors scholarships and awards currently being bestowed upon them the payment of acting as a somewhat privileged buffer group between the white majority and the black masses the chief protection for the students against these notsosubtle attempts at seduction is a strong sense of group identification which will insure group loyalty the involvement of afroamerican student societies such as sas  in the human rights movement indicates a new awareness among black students an awareness which should be supported by all elements of the black community the skills they are acquiring if put to the use of the total group can change the course of the movement and help to speed up the groups progress towards liberation afroamerican experts in such fields as history economics sociology journalism social science and politics should volunteer their services to the students the student movement if successful could eventually lead to an effective alliance between black students and the black masses such an alliance are dreams made of 
 i was stationed in  nigeria for the us information agency during  eight of frdjrilkragj  ° ® jts seventeen officers in the country were american negroes the spring of that year and the advent of birmingham presented the american negro officers with a particularly difficult informationpersuasion problem several who became especially adept in parring nigerian questions about us race relations frequently resorted to the expression its bad yes but lets put it in perspective then followed a carefully contrived monologue that left the nigerian feeling that in essence what was happening in birmingham was a good thing painful evidence that a basic change is being wrought etc at no time during nigerias current crisis have i had the opportunity to ask a us based nigerian information officer whats going on over there whats the trouble all about but if i did ask one and he were a good information officer hed probably tell me precisely what we told him its bad yes but lets put it in perspective he may or may not convince me that what appears to be nigerian chaos is really a good thing but the arguments he could marshal deserve far more consideration than they are getting in the current unbalanced reporting of these events what is happening in nigeria is bad but lets put it in perspective to accept the current press view that nigeria the most stable and most democratic black african republic is coming apart is to betray ones lack of information regarding what the real precoup nigeria was like for one thing it was never really stable or united if we mean by that a relatively permanent sovereign systemit was a subsystem of the british colonial em pire and in spite of a series of constitutional conventions sponsored by the british in preparing nigeria for independence little effective preparation took place instead the british left the country «« firmly in the hands of its favored tribe hausanortherners via a suspicious head count census that turned out to be the seed of the troubles currently reaped hence precoup nigeria   never successfully solved  the riddle that baffles newly sovereign states the problem of powerwho shall rule in accord with what authority this problem was particularly crucial for nigeria because this was not a country of disorganized tribal groupings but a combination of several peoples who as basil davidson put it had every right to consider themselves nations even within the narrowest meaning of the term he later remarks that it is extraordinary after all that nigeria should exist at all  this was indeed extraordinary because the differences that existed and still exist between nigerias big three nonnations yorubaland iboland hausaland include differences in language religion in the ways communities are organized and ruled and basic differences toward the nature of life itselftheir only  significant common heritage was british colonialism and that even differed between northern and southern nigeria the hard truth is that the multitribal multinational combination called nigeria  was never the united sovereignty we came to hail in our press but rather a trial marriage in which the issue of who should be boss was never really settled in retrospect the myth of one nigeria was perhaps as much the creature of nonnigerians as nigerians and one of the side tragedies surrounding this myth was that we the west needed and wanted a united nigeria more than the nigerians so what relevance does this have for what we are seeing in nigeria it means that what we are witnessing is not the disintegration of in the us than to the failure of a colonial effort to make it so this event is less akin to the civil war in the u s than to the failure of the league of nations if we concerned ourselves less with predictions of doom for the rest of africa and more with an analysis of why this is happening we may well learn a few things as important to africaafterthenigeriancrisis as was the myth of one nigeria to the africa before the crisis the most potent lesson to be learned is that most of black africas nations created by the arbitrary groupings of former colonial simply may not survive under the circumstances it may be better to let them come apart and regroup along lines of their own choosing forming new nations with more workable economic and cultural eombinationsand certainly with more harmonious tribal groupings this possibility of complete disintegration followed by a more meaningful reintegration is a bitter pill for most africans and their wellwishers to swallow facing the first part of the proposition disintegration would be less painful however if they had more confidence in the ability of the africans to pull off the second part reintegration  i am one of those who is confident that they can all the africans talk about african personality and african unity simply has to mean something and it could mean much more in more meaningful african states whats happening over there is bad yes but lets see it in this perspective
during world war ii the nd infantry di£ vision left its heado quarters in the arizo w m na desert and crossed the atlantic to italy to engage the nazi and fascist enemy in the mountains of tuscany and in the valley of the po trudging to the front and in the cities that served as leave centers between battles the black soldiers of the nd division took up fists and guns against still another enemythe white fellowsoldier from back home across the nation now veterans of vietnam are returning home to take up their lives after having foughtstill one more timefor the preservation of democracy and the black veterans among them face as did their fathers after world war ii and their grandfathers after world war i the same denial of their rights of citizenship they have put their lives on the line for an idea which for them remains a promise such is an old american custom as old as the republic itself for crispus attucks the bold black man who was the first rebel to give his life in the revolt against the british would have fared no better than his heirs had he lived to enjoy the fruits of his heroism partly because black men have been refused their due as citizens and as warriors history has not underscored their roles and their heroism but there are movements afoot now to put history in perspective and a number of books are being published which unearth facts of the black mans contribution to the story of america which historians once very carefully buried one such book is the buffalo soldiers a narrative of the negro cavalry in the west  written by william leckie and published during last spring by the university of oklahoma press the author is dean of the graduate school of the university of toledo ohio and author of another book on the west also published by the university of oklahoma press the military conquest of the southern plains the buffalo soldiers is a carefully researched report on the black men who were recruited for the ninth and tenth regiments of the united states army following the civil war they were taken into the army primarily to use in controlling and pacifying the indians whose lands the government had seized there were no experienced negro officers and the congress provided that all the officers    were to be white mr leckie says and he indicates that the officers selected to head the two regiments of cavalry were capable and compassionate men considering the circumstances the commander of the ninth cavalry was edward hatch a blond blueeyed native of maine and a veteran of the civil war who had ended his duty there as a brevet major general of volunteers the commander of the tenth cavalry was benjamin grierson a scarredface former music teacher who had contributed materially to grants successful operations around vicksburg the order to form the two regiments was sent out by general ulysses s grant in august  and colonel hatch established headquarters in greenville la while colonel grierson set up headquarters at fort leavenworth kansas there were the usual arguments about the impossibility of black men becoming good soldiers and the recruiters who fanned out over the east and south to enlist recruits made little effort to select ablebodied men the pay was  a month plusof coursefood clothing and shelter which seemed a very good proposition indeed to many freedmen despite the fact many of them were too light too young and had weak constitutions also white officers were extremely reluctant to join units made up of black recruits and the securing of a necessary complement of officers delayed formation of the calvary unitsmr leckie sheds an amusing sidelight on one of the officers who refused to command black troops the dashing boy general george a custer refused a lieutenant colonelcy with the ninth and wrangled the same rank in the newly formed seventh calvarya decision that was probably a stroke of good fortune for the ninth and launched custer on the road to the little big horn and a dubious niche in history  years later in the training camps the black soldiers were quartered in the least desirable areas causing many to become ill they were not permitted to march in review along with white troops on the post and they were the victims of general discrimination at fort leavenworth colonel grierson complained against such treatment and against the fact that the horses supplied to the troops were for the most part old and cripple by august  eight companies of the tenth calvary were in the field three in indian territory and the others stationed at posts and camps along the kansas pacific railroad then under construction soon afterwards colonel grierson transferred his headquarters to fort riley kansas where the organization of the other four companies of the regiment was completed for more than two decades following  the ninth and tenth cavalries served the nation on the great plains and in the mountains  and deserts of arizona and new mexico during the first decade the black troops were pitted constantly against the nomad indiansthe comanches the kiowas the kiowaapaches the southern cheyennes and the araphoes the troops won the indians were forced back into reservations it required at least another five years for the black troops to defeat and pacify the indians along the rio grande frontier with mexico and during this time the buffalo soldiers also fought the apaches of new mexico and arizona in mountain nests and on waterless desolate desert wastes writes mr leckie the duties of the regiments would not be limited to fighting indians law and order were little more than a hope in the postcivil war southwest and civil authorities were compelled constantly to call upon the army to assist in rounding up border scum the region swarmed with cattle thieves as well as men who killed with little or no provocation petty scheming and sometimes murderous politicians combined with greedy land and cattle barons crooked government contractors heartless indian agents and landhungry homesteaders were the source of civil broils of a scope far beyond control of local or state authority the result was inevitable involvement in civil affairs for the ninth and tenth with little hope or expectation of gratitude regardless of outcome or contributionthe two regiments moved west right into the middle of an indian war of almost unprecedented scope and violence the indians had brought the building of the railroad to a virtual standstill and were chasing away settlers scalping traders and scattering cattle the troops moved in to protect railroad workers and stations escort stage coaches and trains and generally scouting the area even an outbreak of cholera among the men which killed a number of them did not relieve them of the heavy responsibility to guard the encroaching forces of civilization battle experience and responsibility mellowed the black recruits and turned them into efficient soldiers mr leckie reports the indians gained a great respect for them as fighting men and it was the indians who gave the troops the name buffalo soldiers many of the individual tales of extraordinary heroism and valor exhibited by the black troops are recounted in the book as well as the facts of the governments lack of consideration of them and the tendency to overwork them an example the buffalo soldiers hardly had time to cool their saddles detachments were necessary for constant escort to stages and trains to protect workers at the end of track and to scout along the smoky hill saline and solomon rivers in august alone the overworked troopers scouted more than  miles searching for the flitting red raiders    september was more of the same until the middle of the month then captain g w graham with  men of i company struck and followed a trail along the denver road until they reached big sandy creek here  cheyennes were waiting and engaged them in a bitter fight at close quarters the men of i in their first encounter and outnumbered badly fought like cornered wildcats when the engagement ended at nightfall  cheyennes were dead and  wounded graham reported his loss as one man wounded and  horses either killed or missing the book throws significant light on the career and fate of lt henry flipper the first and only negro officer in the tenth regiment a hero on the front lt flipper later faced disgrace because of the jealousv of his fellow officers all of   whom were white the summer of     found lieutenant flipper in major trouble the only negro officer in the    united states army flipper had been assigned to nolans a company he was well received by officers and men and proved an excellent soldier his services in the victorio war had won plaudits from both nolan and grierson and a bright career seemed assured clouds appeared on the horizon when a company came in to fort concho flipper found a riding companion in one of the few eligible young ladies at the post and his attentions aroused the resentment of some of his fellow officers one of the officers who resented lt flipper was a lt charles nordstrom who previously had enjoyed the ladys favors the upshot of the antagonism was that lt flipper named post commissary was arrested for embezzling  and confined to the post guardhouse the black officer was later cleared of embezzlement charges but nevertheless convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer and booted out of the cavalry to the end of his days flipper maintained that he was the victim of a plot hatched by colonel shafter lt nordstrom and lt louis wilhelm by  the tenth was no longer needed on the texas frontier settlement law and order which the regiment had done so much to further had arrived    the sioux troubles of  and the fight at drexel mission capped the long career of the ninth cavcontinued from page  airy on the frontier this performance was in keeping with the record of the regiment since its departure from san antonio  years before four companies marched an incredible  miles under blizzard conditions fought two engagements and saved a command twice their strength from grievous loss they received little official recognition    alas that is a familiar story it was true of the original buffalo soldiers and true of those who followedunder the buffalo bannerthree quarters of a century later in the mountains of italy and no doubt it will be true of all those black young men now fighting the nations war in southeast asia the buffalo soldiers were brave and valiant men and though there is little reason to be happy that they helped to destroy the indian tribes who were the original settlers of this land it is more than a little appropriate that their role in the development of the west be toldat lastin detail and with fairness
it was not until rash   man x the little black muslim began talking to us my friend teddy crawford and me that i began to notice for him the teasing seemed all for fun but i was  living through a very serious vulnerable summer so there was something deeper than fun in it for me rashman was a small man four inches shorter than i and though i was skinny then rashman was skinnier he was a neat taut man with skin the color of pitch his neatness and his dignity prevented his looking scrawny even with his knees and elbows coming to points as they did when he bent them beneath his starched white barbers uniform his hair was peppergray and always neat and parted and i never saw him once when he needed a shave that saturday morning when teddy crawford and i entered his barbershop the bums off ninth street followed us bringing with them their usual odor of tobacco filth and wine to mix with the odor of talc and aftershave lotion in side they took seats along the wall to wait for the teasing that always followed when rashman and i got together rashmans wit was as sharp as the razor he shaved himself with and i was foolish enough to challenge him he had a clever way making small things seem significant thus leaving them no longer small for example that saturday while i was in the chair he brought to my attention that all the women in my fathers churchs woman society for christian service were even as dark as teddy crawford and i and we were only medium brown yes and i remember how rashman had stopped me when i said only medium brown thus succeeding cleverly at making the bums think that i had said that we had fallen away from grace by only that much that at least we were not black i didnt say that i challenged quickly but rashman was already laughing what i called then his little wickerwire laugh way back in the roof of his mouth he cut me off so i would not have a chance to explain myself dont let folks brain wash you son he said whenever we faced off like this and he scored first he always spoke rapidly so i would not be able to score back i guess the christians taught you that black is the color of evil he laughed deliciously be careful son be careful     then of course brain washing is seldom very painful and if its done subtly you never know its happened i knew a fellow once who went his entire life brain washed died happy though he winked at the bums and bent over to pump my chair up a little higher the bums smiled a few of them cleared their throats and there i was defenseless sitting in the middle of the shop with the silly barbers cloth tied around my neck wait youre trying to make these gentlemen think that i    no im not criticizing you nooo i dont blame you one little bit its very hard to stand against an entire christian civilization its no fun having to make up everything from scratch    better a servant in the house of the lord than a king among the unholy huh is that the way the bible says it he laughed again i dont blame you one iota why    why enter the woods if you are not sure you can find your way out the bums laughed partly at me and partly with me we all have to enter the woods sometime i said oh sure yes yes its not bad to come in just dont come too deep come in look around then scat back he spun my chair you jump to conclusions too fast i said but this was not one of my good answers it did not get a rise out of the bums as some of my cracks used to doyes i do i do i shouldnt blame you for    give me a chance to talk oh yes alright i got down out of the chair talking trying to hit on something that would swing the bums to my side but rashman had me too far down he could afford to smile complacently while i argued someone else got in the chair and he began pumping the chair up again after much grumbling from teddy crawford we left but only after i declared that i would be back as soon as i got myself together he sent me out onto the sidewalk with laughter and catcalls following me i laughed myself i liked rashman and i knew that he and the bums liked me but the only bad thing was he had been defeating me too soundly and too often ever since back in may when too much seriousness began to creep into my mood rashmans barber shop was the cleanest business on ninth street however my father warned me many times not to go there and listen to rashmans bile but teddy crawford and i with our money in our pockets would go down to ninth street on saturday morning and wander around until i could talk teddy into going to rashmans shop instead of to one of the others i always had to promise him that afterwards i would go with him up to maxine greens apartment over the tom thumb tailor shop maxines mother was never home on saturday mornings so i kept maxines three younger brothers outside while teddy slipped the meat to her in the bedroom okay teddy said on the first saturday in july only one week after he had promised never to go with me again ill go if you promise not to waste all day arguing with that nut okay to hell with rashman i said as we were coming down from teddys house toward the upper end of ninth street now youre talking baby teddy said walking widelegged filling his lungs with air obviously thinking about maxine green hey looka here rashman said as i pushed his front door open my little friends from the hill have come back the heavy glass door sucked close behind us i thought i scared you children away last time making light of your lord and saviour jesus christ like i did he spoke loud enough for everyone in the shop to hear at least ten men had followed us in two of them had to stand because there were not enough seats teddy and i took our seats along the wall under the row of gleaming mirrors to wait our turns in the chairs rashmans assistant a leanquiet boy who came in from st louis each weekend to work at rashmans mosque  barber shop always cut teddys hair he liked to cut close and that was the way teddys mother liked it rashman did not say anything more to me until i got in the chair this was a tactic of his then how are things up home he said as i sat down did you tell the reverend what i said last week yeah i lied he said one of these days a bolt of lightnings going to hit your vilifying soul shaderow who had just sat down in the seat i had vacated laughed and repronounced my word rashman laughed and shook out the large pinstriped cover cloth he waved it in front of me like a magician teddy got into the chair next to mine the two men who had been playing checkers back near the shoeshine stand turned around to watch the bums seemed out of place with their tattered clothing and dirty bodies in the gleaming tile glass and porcelain shop the bright july sunlight passing thru the large clean front windows highlighted their filth it showed clearly the spittle in the mouth of one toothless one who was smiling as rashman spun me around rashman began by combing my hair briskly it was kinky because with all the reading i was doing i did not have time to care for it he  made it pop and made the dust fly to put me further at a disadvantage by now all the bums were smiling waiting for the argument between me and rashman x the only negro in town who had courage enough to turn his back completely on christianity what words of wisdom do you have for us today my young man rashman asked none i answered and looked over at teddy crawford still believe in the saving grace of jesus christ he asked biblically knowing that i was going to say yes doesnt it frighten you being in here where lightning might strike then no how about you young man rashman asked spinning teddys chair so abruptly that the other barber had to jerk his clippers back teddy smiled fawningly his oily peanutsmooth complexion reddened his fat slick cheeks and round slick head seemed to fill up with blood no sir rashman let him go teddy was not the one he wanted he wanted me i was the outspoken one besides i had secretly been considering following my father into the christian ministry i suspected that rashman knew this and this was why he taunted me more than teddy we argued but everytime i was about to make a good point rashman would spin me away from my audience i would be facing myself selfconsciously in the mirror behind the chair the image of the row of bums bouncing back and forth between the mirrors on the opposite walls then rashman would pop my hair and the bums would roar i stood up when he was done and let him brush the hair off my green and yellow polo shirt teddy was finished long before i was he was in a hurry to get up to maxines christianity is dead thats a fact and it makes you a necrophiliac rashman sang the bums broke up over this word they smacked their thighs and laughed amen yea tell it like it is i waved rashman away as i followed teddy toward the door i had to laugh too when shaderow almost choked trying to repronounce necrophiliac but my laughter was not deep too much of what rashman said was too important the next sunday was a bright hot day i got up early let the sun into my room dressed carelessly and went outside thinking about rashman i wanted to skip church but i knew that i would not be able to tell my father why i walked around for a long time trying to decide what to do our church was the largest negro methodist church in the district and there were only three or four white churches largerall of them city churches up in st louis it was a natural stone building like the parsonage in which we lived they both sat on a grassy plot a block and a half from the negro college the neighborhood was not at all like you would picture a negro ghetto the houses and lawns were all wellcared for most of the houses were brick or stone and the few of them that were woodframe were in good repair the vacant lots around the campus and the church were all well cared for the streets were all paved sidewalks ran on both sides all the way up from ninth street back past carson avenue and laterally on all sides from bullock to canterberry except for the two blocks where the wall and the iron fence of the community cemetery precluded sidewalks nearly everyone in the entire neighborhood was a member of my fathers church most of them were teachers at hl single high school or over at the college ours was a world of secure jobs and easy living the bigotry and injustice which menaced the lives of so many black people during these years was closed out of it i walked down toward mason street thinking about that when i got down almost to where teddy crawford lived younger children started to come out of the houses dressed for sunday school i thought it best that  beat it back and get ready to teach my sunday school class all during the hour i was hot with anxiety in the airconditioned building the lesson was about david the shepherd what i wondered did that have to do with anything obviously rashman had a way of getting weekly bulletins from the church for just as he said this was installation sunday for the new officers of the womans society for christian service i watched them as they filed past me toward the front of the church ah and you watch them rashman had said everyone of them past the age thirty has to wear glasses because their eyes are weak mongrelizations done it and you watch every one of them will be fat from over indulgence and lack of discipline on sunday as i watched the women i hated their stuffy sanctimonious smiles all of them were lightskinned plump and slightly bent all except two wore glasses i wondered if this was just a coincidence that rashman had noticed and decided to use against me or whether however silly scientifically it might seem his statement about mongrelization had some truth to it i thought for a moment then i shook my head no i could picture him behind his chair his image in the mirror showing his scissors poised above my unkempt hair his face caught for one static moment between smiles his own eyes aided by thin rimless glasses as i sat there in church i thought that i could hear his brief wickerwire laughter old mrs turner my high school civics teacher was standing two down from the end she had been called forward as the new recording secretary i focused my attention on her she used to call me her little preacher i shook with fear at the prospect that rashman might find out and tell it in the crowded barber shop as i looked at mrs turner i filled up with anger because even now i was arguing with rashman and losing mrs turner was too much for me to explain to someone like the bums rashman would get the better of me mrs turner was a big buttercolored woman who wore heavy coke bottlebottom glasses she hated her job and she hated the kids she had to teach all she taught for was the money in it that was plain from the way she acted i knew how much rashman would make of the contempt she had for the poorer kids from over in chambers who came to school poorly dressed and often a little dirty these kids were either timid and backwards or too manish or womanish for their ages to suit mrs turner the one group she ignored as often as she could and the others she expelled whenever she could get away with it i knew how rashman would tease me about the way mrs turner complimented me for not being like them her little preacher i shook my head again she did have the biggest tits on the faculty i could score with the bums by mentioning that and by adding that i was sure they didnt grow because of heavy sexual activity she must play with them every night and boy you ought to see them big yellow thighs when she sits up in the window sill at school i would say to make the bums laugh id sure like to get some of that stuff they would break up over thatlittle skinny me and big mrs turner still i would lose the argument with rashman because he knew me too well to be sidetracked but i was beginning to know rashman too he was wrong his science was screwed up shaderow and the others knew he was wrong too they were christians i had heard how groups of them would get juiced up on saturday night and pile into filberts car and go over to elder nashs church and sing and cry about whatever they had losta mother or father or something but rashman was right about them in a way christianity would never do more for them than make they feel a little better for a little while like a piece of blues
for a month i did not go back to see rashman i was not ready to face him he was wrong but i did not know how to convince him his house sat across a vacant lot from his shop it was one of only three or four neat houses amid the squalor that was ninth street the house seemed very small sitting by itself behind a very straight wire fence unlike most of the houses around it it was freshly painted and all the boards were in place the house sat on piles and back under it the dirt was raked as level as concrete usually after eight oclock in the evening the windows in his house would darken i would see them as i passed taking nancy adkins home to chambers as far as i knew the lean boy from st louis was the only nonrelative who had ever entered rashmans house shaderow and filbert never had even the insurance man left him alone often i wanted to stop by nancy would say that it was all right with her but i was always a little too afraid i knew that rashman would be different without the bums to show off fordifferent and deeper often as i passed the house i would comment on how lonely it must get for rashman in there because at heart he was a talker the windows in the little old house would seem like halfclosed darkened eyes looking out on this dumping ground of christian civilization i went for six weeks without seeing rashman when my mother made what seemed her final threat i went to mr granisons barber shop to get my hair cut but the sunday after father let the man from the state fish and game board mealymouth the morning service i decided to go down to see rashman i was met at the door by his wife she was a small black woman who looked  or  years older than rashman my husband is not home she said but do come in she did not wait to see if i was going to follow but simply turned and walked ahead of me down the hallway into the living room the house had a stale odor inside like the odor inside the houses of very old people no sunlight came through the windows which were heavily draped the living room that we entered was small the heavy oldfashioned chair and sofa were covered with matching faded flowery slipcovers the rug was of a hard weave on the wall was a picture of rashman receiving his diploma from a high school in st louis this made me wonder how old rashman really was he had many gray hairs but his skin was very smooth he could be any age i examined the picture for a date but found none when i turned away from the wall mrs x  motioned for me to sit in the chair under the picture she sat on the sofa across the room rashman has gone to st louis now for a little while she said he was very discontented here  he told me a lot about you said you were the smartest youngster he had seen in a while not really i said and waved her comment away she looked at me and smiled he said when you get out of college you will be a great asset to the race the masses of our people need so much it always must be hoped that your generation will do much better than ours she examined me again with that curious look of hers two barefooted baldheaded boys of about four or five ran to the living room door and peeped in she laughed and called them forward pharoah and benda this is mr billy aaron she pushed them forward to meet me the bigger one took his fingers out of his mouth and gave me his wet hand to shake i was glad for their presence because i felt that their mother was very sad about something and i was not sure that i would know how to respond to it if she would decide to tell me what it was i took the smaller boy and tossed him toward the ceiling the bigger one pushed into my arms for some of the same treatment while i was engaged with them their mother slipped out of the room and brought back a glass of iced tea the two boys sat on my knees while i drank then i heard their sister come downstairs i knew that it was shera because i remembered that she was a very slow walker at home she was a much more imposing girl than at school she wore no makeup and her hair had been cut very short and had not been hot combed in a long time how was church this morning she asked she did not call me billy as she did at school but mr aaron as her mother called me when she asked shera you do know mr aaron do you not yes mother mr aaron is the best athlete in the tenth grade well her mother said rather sagelike rashman told me that how was church shera asked and smiled good i said and shrugged she must have known about the man from the fish and game board i did not know if she were going to tell rashman i did not know if i really cared we were christians once even shera was mrs x said we were church of god in christ she waited for a moment she seemed happy remembering you dont sing spirituals in your church do you no we sing anthems chorals neither word sounded right so i tried again you know hymns yes she said chorals are nice i knew she was saying this to make me feel good she looked like the kind who had loved spirituals in that other life of hers i talked for a long time with shera and mrs x about my plans to go to college and someday to be a writer as i talked i kept thinking yes education i must get that i cannot allow this disenchantment in me to drive me to the same conclusions that rashmans had driven him for i was sure now that his wife had with sadness let him go away to do whatever his restlessness was forcing him to do i was sure that when he left home he did not know himself exactly what that was in st louis the black muslims had started to make stands against the police i hoped very hard that this would not lead to violence in his absence i felt closer to rashman than i ever had i was afraid for him i was afraid that he had gone away to do what he said to make a stand against an entire civilization i wished that he had ¦ not gone i wanted to argue with him again i wanted to convince him that what he felt he had to do was not necessary but i was sure that if i had been given the chance to talk to him again i would not have known what to say
the second annual fisk university writers conference settled into the comfort of an established institution during the threeday session april  the fireworks of the student rebellion earlier in the month echoed on the campus and in the city of nashville but the conference proceeded in an atmosphere of calm and congeniality the conference theme was the black writer and human rights and novelist john o killens who as writerinresidence and head of the campus writers workshop had organized the conference invited seven writers to participate in panels devoted to a consideration of human rights as relates to the writers particular literary disciplines the writers were novelists ronald fair and mr killens nonfiction authors lerone bennett jr and john henrik clarke poets gwendolyn brooks and margaret danner and playwrights leroi jones and ronald milner mr killens was assisted by workshop students bessie frazier lonnetta gaines donald graham phyllis griffith harold lazard and kathryn mickens four of whom introduced the visiting authors to the audiences in the appleton room of historic jubilee hall the turn out for all the panel discussions was large and enthusiastic and the final sessions drew a crowd which left even standing room at a premium the attraction understandably was leroi jones the poetplaywright delivered a meaty and provocative speech and then ignited the student audience with a thoroughly effective theatrical reading of a group of his poems the conference proceedings were marked by a notable lack of controversy probably because those who might have disagreed with the panelists declined to appear or if they were present in the audience they remained silent from all indications also few members of the faculty were in attendance with one or two exceptions the visiting writers were not received by faculty members and those faculty members who made the effort to greet the writers were not from the english department on a singularly unfortunate occasion two panelists were forced to answer one of the young workshop hosts who implied impertinently that older black poets had not been paying their dues the student might have saved himself considerable embarrassment by reading in advance some of the work of the poets who shared the platform with him lerone bennett jr who is senior editor of ebony magazine as well as author of four published books and a fifth to be published this summer was asked to explain how he a blackoriented writer justified his association with a magazine which appeared to disdain blackness in its advertisements and in some features and to idealize white middleclass values in its features the author who is frequently confronted with such questions made no effort to justify the magazines editorial policies and directions however he did point to the magazines contributions in the area of negro history and black consciousness and sought without much success to explain the hard facts of economics which influenced the magazines publisher in catering to what is demonstrably the general public preference the growth of black consciousness on the fisk campus was evident it is not possible to gauge novelist john o killens direct influence on this phenomenon but the writers relaxed informal manner and his total lack of pomp and pretention cannot but have proved a remarkable change for a faculty member on the campus the thrust of his relationship with the student has been to narrow the distance between teacher and student rather than to expand it during the final session of the fisk conference those in attendance drafted and approved a statement in support of dr martin_luther_king jr and his stand relative to the war in vietnam the statement which had the prior approval of writerpanelists who had departed for home lerone bennett jr ronald fair read as follows we support dr martin l kings stand in his opposition to the war in vietnam for many diverse personal reasons but most especially because dr_king has been consistent in his desire for nonviolence both within american borders and by america herself abroad we find it difficult to understand why a man hailed for his stand on nonviolence and a recipient of the nobel peace prize should now be castigated because he refuses to mount the white charger to lead brave young men into armed battle dr_king has never stood for armed battle and we can find no overwhelming reason for him to send young men to kill now he has stood ready to give his life in love for peace not in malice for war and for this we commend him those endorsing the statement included john o killens john henrik clarke leroi jones ronald milner the week following the writers conference ushered in the th annual festival of music and art on campus during which at least three other noted writers appeared before the students paule marshall novelist and short story writer spoke on legacy in black robert hayden poet and fisk teacher read from his recently published book selected poems and robert e lee coauthor of the comedy auntie mame addressed the assembly other highlights of the festival included an exhibition of sculptures by john w rhoden and paintings by walter williams a concert by miriam makeba a concert by the fisk jubilee singers and a dance recital under the direction of mrs mabel r love choreographer
should the new african nations try first to organize their own human resources and concentrate on building viable economic institutions at home or should they seek to develop into modern nations through allout policies of economic interdependency with the great industrial countries of the west this was one of the questions posed during a conversation with africa seminar sponsored by the phelpsstokes fund may  at holly knoll the robert r moton conference center at capahosic virginia during the seminar an american employee of a federal agency advanced the suggestion that emergent africas best bet for development lay in economic interdependency with the industrial giants the american was forcefully challenged by the ambassador of an east african nation who described the true nature of economic interdependency between africa and the west as one of western rapacity of african natural resources the ambassador agreed that africa needs the technology and capital of the west but he declared thatfor his country at any ratethat technology and capital was welcome only if it came to africa on africas terms during the threeday seminar some  africans and afroamericans spoke with eloquence candor and occasionally much heat on such general topics as the nature of africanamerican relations the role of afroamerican colleges can play in the advancement of africa the urgent need for the intellectual emancipation of all black people the mutual problems and destiny of black people on the two continents and the need for afroamericans to rally to the support of freedom movements in those areas of africa still under european domination capahosic is not much of a town and the casual motorist is likely to drive past it without being aware of holly knoll or of the existence and purpose of the conference center however the group of black people of remarkably varied career backgrounds and philosophical outlook who travelled to the idyllic little retreat on the banks of the york river had the best of motives for seeking it out they came for a serious dialogue on the problems facing black people everywhere most of them believing that the genuine freedom of black people in any land is compromised so long as black people in any other land remain unfree it was the second such seminar organized by the phelpsstokes fund and possibly because of the previous experience all went like clockwork a few of the guests arrived by automobile driving in from washington points in virginia and even from new york city but most arrivals were met at the airport in richmond and chauffeured out to capahosic through verdant and peaceful country holly knoll which is growing in importance as a conference center is equipped to accommodate up to  people comfortably the spacious manor house has more than a dozen bedrooms as well as a dining room and salons there is a motel with some six apartments and a rustic log cabin with three bedrooms for relaxation there is a game room which adjoins the conference room tennis courts a swimming pool and a pier jutting out into the river which makes boating fishing or even swimming possible holly knoll was established by the robert r moton memorial foundation in honor of the former president of tuskegee institute and it is supported by gifts and guided by the phelpsstokes fund whose president is dr frederick d patterson himself a former president of tuskegee the retreat has played host to small groups concerned with dialogueparticularly on matters regarding race relationsfor a decade this years conversation with africa seminar attracted a remarkably diverse group of conversants a reflection of the acumen of the director robert s browne the africans in attendance were ambassador and mrs michael lukumbuzya of tanzania mr cofer of nigeria chauncey cooper of liberia elio samba second counsellor of the embassy of the democratic republic of the congo kinshasa david wakati information counsellor of the embassy of tanzania mrs regina dickson wife of the second secretary of the embassy of ghana and paul touba and emmanuel fernandes two student refugees from angola the afroamericans present were keith

the negro in his struggle for an equal coexistence has been fed a teething biscuit with a gradualism flavor by his white counterpart in his trips downtown to negotiate that which is rightfully his he has been sent to the bargain basement with the staging of public demonstrations no longer capable of bluffing the white social regime into complete acceptance of the negro it is necessary that he abandon this weapon worn by repetition for a new and even more effective one the negro must unite into one force and together develop new ideas and methods of achieving true and genuine equality this can best be accomplished thru a master maneuver enacted by all black people and under close supervision of sincere leaders leaders whose every move is calculated and interpreted by a nationally elected committee a committee elected by a black vote and representative of that people a committee cognizant of negroes needs desires and goals realizing that the negroes present method for gaining equality is losing its effectiveness i would like to propose an idea designed to corporate all negroes and other liberal minded sympathizers into a tactful unit i suggest first listing the names twentyfive or more of responsible negroes negroes that are nationally known and whom black america feels is capable of legislating and controlling a mass negro movement the names submitted men and women by individuals or organizations would be negroes they feel possess the necessary qualifications to represent them and whose decisions they would respect and trust without censorship after composing such a list a national vote could be taken on the names received and the ten receiving the most votes would comprise the committee each committee member representing a certain number of states would have representation in that state these representatives primarily would be responsible for reaching negroes in their prospective precincts they will act as a liaison between the committee and the negro population relaying the strategy necessary to stage an effective national maneuver it is my firm belief that this committee with a nationally pledged negro support could effectively pressure the white society into complete admission people interested in discussing developing or modifying this idea may write to ronald l lyles  central avenue washington d c  enjoyed the march issue of negro digest with its informative notes on negro writers jazz etc clemmont e vontress article should your child attend a ne gro college particularly caught my attention his points concerning the autocratic often antiintellectual atmosphere of most negro campuses are very well taken however i think what is really needed is better negro colleges rather than none at all as the authors logic would suggest in spite of much superficial instruction it is worth noting the rich history of achievement that centers around the uncf colleges after all we didnt just spring from africa and arrive intact where we are now things happened things that are part of a history every negro needs to know at a time when negro intellectuals are bitterly grasping for some kind of meaningful racial identity there are many things that can be said in favor of attending a negro school at least for a while one thing the negro colleges have given southern negroes is an academic tradition however modest and a respect for family stability community achievement and the simple yes middle class things of the good life a lack of these traditions is what really makes harlem in sophisticated manhattan a bigger hell hole than atlanta ga pfc charles s brown fort monmouth new jersey black women dear editor any black woman who suffers from the wig and hot iron mentality deserves no respect the hot iron and wig are openbook manifestations that she doesnt respect herself arent you sick of seeing the wigladen paintfaced select few being trotted before the tv cameras they lean over backwards to satisfy one never hears so many oohs and ahs or sees so much skinning and grinning to please the white program host and audience i wonder if they have  ever been schooled on the subject of a new day acomin or been hipped to the fact that there is a publication called negro digest it certainly is a sad day and no wonder a black writerprobably ? long ago dubbed responsible by the good white folkcomes out throwing love and kisses to a black woman singer for no longer wearing her hair natural the black woman must learn to respect herself the lack of her selfrespect is not limited to the hot iron and wig it reaches to far greater proportions the rank gall of some black women after reaching a certain stage in their climb to become a celebrity bemoaning the fact that there are no black men on their level is disgusting this is the best  alibi that they can fabricate in order to do what they had in mind all along have white menand not necessarily in marriage it seems peculiar that so many black women embark upon careers in which white men are their chief benefactors could be that black women should stop concentrating so much on singing and dancing which so often be  comes jigdancing footshuffling etc goodness knows that we have been entertained enough  the black woman must break that ugly alliance with the white man that j often matures in halfwhite babies sitting on black knees she must stop j trying to build a logic around wigs and hot irons by using the tired excuse that miss ann also uses the beauty parlor why not a broad  nose thick lips wide hips black skin i and natural hair all of these seem i to me to have been godgiven i i revere black women i respect a black women but only those who i live in the context of reality
