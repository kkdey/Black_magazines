this paper will deal with three subjects race war and politics t i believe they have always determined the direction of this nation i believe we stand on the brink of catastrophe right now because of them one hundred and ninetyone years ago war was the mother of our country we were born of violence the politics of revolution were spearheaded by men who believed in the dignity of man but being economically subordinate to england robbed them of that we know that those intellectuals pondered long and with both logic and emotion about the status of a man who was a man a white man was of course a man but an indian a negro slave or free     the question was left hanging and we are still dealing with it within and without the nation liberty yes freedom but of course for some but not for all let me take you back to a short time before our rebellion really got under way let me take you to boston and to crispus attucks chris attucks one of the first men to die in the boston massacre was charged with starting the riot but did he in fact by his actions instigate the massacre there are some sidelights that should speak for themselves first of all chris attucks was a runaway slave he was over six feet tall and they used to tell stories about his knockknees it seems unlikely that a runaway slave would draw attention to himself by leading a mob through boston streets and look what patriot was going to allow himself to be led by a black man anyway in any case attucks died when a column of british soldiers opened fire in king street he died instantly with two others eleven other people were wounded and two of these died later john adams above the protests of the citizens defended the soldiers and declared attucks appears to have undertaken to be the hero of the night and to lead this army with banners to form them up in the first place in dock square and march them up to king street with clubs it was attucks to whose mad behavior in all probability the dreadful carnage of this night is chiefly to be ascribed the attorney for the people samuel adams however revealed that attucks was leaning upon a stick when he fell which certainly was not a threatening posture did john adams long a prominent figure in massachusetts politics find in attucks a scapegoat a corpse could not speak for itself and wasnt it easier to charge the provocation of the incident on a dead negro slave than on a live white patriot we do not know we can only surmise what we do know is that attucks now enshrined in copper on the boston commons became one of the martyrs of the rebellion and the colonists needed martyrs whether they were black white or red three years later speaking of red  persons crept aboard three ships in boston harbor and threw overboard  cases of tea this was the old boston tea party of course the members of the party were disguised as indians why the disguises why those disguises the british werent afraid of indians they had beaten them rather badly in the french and indian wars no our patriots in order to evade detection participated in a charade of racism put the blame on the negro put the blame on the indian our minds bend naturally in that direction anyway because they have different color skins and they above all are the most vulnerable people in our society racism was a part of our national psychology before the constitution was framed from boston harbor we advance to concord bunker hill and lexington if you remember your history you know that it was every state militia for itself and every town for itself congress hadnt been formed yet there was no such thing as an american army and politics were local choose any of these shrines of liberty peer into the nearby brush or any woodpile that served as cover and yes you did find a negro therein both woodpile and brush ill only bore you with a few names peter salem salem poor cuff whittemore cato stedman cato bordman some of the northern slave owners liked greek and roman names while others had no imagination at all for some of the black patriots bore names like george negro charles negro emmanuel negro and negro james these black militiamen did just as well as the black gi is doing in vietnamonly they didnt have television in those days or high speed printing presses so not many people knew about it but when the plans for a unified war were made black militiamen were ordered to turn in their guns and clubs because the colonies decided that it would be too dangerous and unwise to keep them armed whether they were slave or free besides it looked as though there might be such a thing as an american army then there would be a lot of white men to fight for this precious thing called freedom thus it was quite natural for slaves to gather in the roads in the dust of the riders who called out to arms to arms the british are coming the british promised to free the slaves if they joined the redcoats and they did to such an alarming extent that the continental congress which was having trouble rounding up all the patriots anyway now that the fighting was to be in earnest reversed its field and once more black soldiers found their way into the ranks of the fighting men some  of them historian walter millis points out that it was embarrassing to the patriots to be fighting for liberty while maintaining the institution of slavery it was almost equally embarrassing on the other hand to be accused of raising a servile army to fight libertys battles for them many american commanders complained about their troops general philip schuyler wrote from saratoga in  complaining that one third of the soldiers he had been sent were boys old men and negroes of course later he wrote they disgrace our arms is it consistent with the sons of freedom to trust all to be defended by slaves under the command of horatio gates the americans won a decisive battle over the british at saratoga what would general schuyler have to say if he were in vietnam today i wondernegroes continued in the ranks until the war was won we had liberty now and freedom we were independent but we still had slavery and in fact most of the black soldiers who were slaves were not set free for their services they were returned to slavery it is no wonder that the rhodesian unilateral declaration of independence sounds so much like ours within just a few years we found ourselves in trouble again the british and french although engaged in a war with each other were busily impressing our seamen we were only half as disturbed by that as by the prospect of snitching a bit more land from them while they were scrapping so the impressment of our sailors gave us the excuse and we rushed northward to canadaonly to be repulsed by the british and their allies the poor worthless indian we just barely saved our skins up there we never did get canada our sea forces saved us and fortunately for us we did manage to win two or three important land battles but the going was so rough that the new england states threatened to secede from the union the war was not very popular there that war of  then we got lucky and won a few down south at new orleans andrew jackson who had had to issue a call for negro volunteers to help repel the british who had landed in  finally threw them back if jackson had lost the british would have had a foothold in the south with access to florida still held by spain the land acquired by america through the revolution and the treaty of  and the great land mass of the louisiana purchase if youre ever down around louisiana back country and you hear someone speak of freejacksyoull know that these negroes are the descendants of the free negroes who fought with jackson we need not go into the mexican war except to say that after texas became independent it stood outside the union for almost  years it took that long to decide whether texas should be a slave state or a free state it came in as a slave state now we approached the civil war our past had been marked by expansion a sloppy foreign policy brought about in part by the distance between washington and european capitals the pioneer had become the early westerner the factories of the north bursting with energy and raw materials were famished for manpower and much of it came from abroad the indentured white servant was vanishing the slave trade had been halted but slavery continued with about  slaves mostly in the south our ties to france and great britain were adequate and some of this was due to the cotton we were producing down on the old plantation then mr lincoln went into the white house now he had made clear his position on slavery he had expressed sympathy for the slave but he also made it clear that if one race had to be superior then he preferred that white men hold that position the south was not convinced they did not believe this was due to mr lincolns equivocating on the issue and so we entered the war drawn by south carolina on a winter night in  the north possessed  per cent of the population along with over  per cent of all the factories it produced  per cent of the nations wealth held  per cent of all the bank deposits and owned  per cent of all the farms the south could put into the battlefield only a little over a million white males between the ages of  and  the north on the other hand had  white males of the same ages but the souths great slave population made the difference for it allowed the southerners to release for duty a larger number of white males than the north could spare from its industrial complexes two hundred thousand negroes in  regiments fought for the union in the civil war and it was the opinion of many people that without those  negroes the south would have won its independence before  the north was reeling from the effect of confederate victories and general sherman said nobody can save the country our men are not good soldiers they brag but they dont perform what is in store for us i dont know president lincoln sent out a call for  menand got less than  in five weeks by the end of summer  he saw but one course he wrote i now determined upon the adoption of the emancipation policy and without consultation with or the knowledge of the cabinet i prepared the original draft of the proclamation and after much anxious thought called a cabinet meeting on the subject secretary of state william seward who later would provide a house for harriet tubman was horrified he cried it may be viewed as the last measure of an exhausted governmen a cry for help the government stretching forth its hand to ethiopia instead of ethiopia stretching forth her hand to the government lincoln then delayed the proclamation but the second union defeat at bull run forced him to stretch forth the hand of his government to ethiopia he issued the emancipation proclamation on january   states and locales fighting on the union side were allowed to keep their slaves by august of  lincoln could write the use of colored troops constitutes the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion to another correspondent he wrote drive back to the support of the rebellion the physical force which the colored people now give and promise us and neither the present nor any coming administration can save the union navy secretary gideon wells said there is an unconquerable prejudice on the part of many whites against black soldiers but all our increased military strength comes from them since the proclamation did not free all the slaves a thirteenth amendment was necessary a decade after the war the south was back in the hands of the rebels where it still is and the process of inventing a creature called the negro moved into a brand new and ugly phase perhaps it was so ugly in the south because the southerner knew that this black man this slave had turned the tide against him this was the most important war in our history and all we give our school children from it is that mr lincoln freed the slaves what the hell kind of history is that the facts are available and they speak for themselvesand very loudly this would have been a very different country if it had not been for  blacks whose descendants are still screaming for the same liberty they made possible for white people over  years ago if we had recognized that fact and honored that very real obligation it might have changed the course of our history within and without from the very beginning they say that the longest journey begins with but a single step perhaps we took that step with crispus attucks and the boston tea party quite probably even before without how did we fare we had the monroe doctrine but that was unilateral and supported by the british because they held like commercial interests with ours this british participation blocked the attempts of the holy alliance of the great powers in europe to extend its influence into the western hemisphere the alliance collapsed in  which was why when the civil war began those europeans could take the time to pick and choose a possible winner and cast lots with him two years after the war we bought alaska from russia for one penny an acre or a little over  at this same time france was ending a war in mexico and the british were preparing to consolidate in africa the claims made by its many explorers and missionaries a new confederation was established in north germany and the francoprussian war was about to begin everyone for the time being was busy a new era was in the making while the british and french despite their differences and the germans as well were striving for new territories in africa we pushed westward our dark continent was our own west of chicago and kansas city while the europeans were busily slaughtering andor converting the heathen in africa and asia we set about doing the same in the west we had to link the east and west coasts we had to put down rails so the trains could run somebody said there was more gold and silver and more of our eastern citizens came west there were already some people out here they were indians and they were in the way the trains couldnt run safely the wagon trains were in danger the miners couldnt dig gold and fight at the same time there was only one answer we had cleared the eastern seaboard of the indian and we could do it in the west we made bad treaties with the indians the kind of treaties we wouldnt offer a white man and we killed them they killed some of us too but we did the better job wed brought over the chinese to help build the railroads and when they were finished we shipped them back or in any case passed an immigration law that wouldnt allow any more chinese into the country in the meantime we ran the indians to death and when we didnt we put them on reservations the sorry thing for black people about what was done to the indians was that four negro regimentstwo infantry and two cavalryhelped do it as a matter of fact if george armstrong custer had accepted the colonelcy he was offered in the ninth cavalry regimentnegrohe might not have wound up dead at little big horn with the seventh for all that we did to the indian there are still regions in this nation where the population density is far less than  persons per square mile we could have lived with the indian he became for generations of white children the object of fantasy upon which they demonstrated their masculinity and superiority that is whenever they tired of negro objects all the movies and television aside we know that the indian did win some battles we also know that we beat him not always by force of arms and men but by treachery the kind of treachery in which we rationalized away the inherent racism of this nation you know we look upon ourselves as a peaceloving people our slogans of peace are always in the air always on the lips of our leaders but in fact this is a myth we must destroy in order to look at ourselves and see what we really are since  our armies have managed to acquire more square miles on this globe by naked military power than any other nation except great britain it has been a neck and neck race between the british and the americans with the british seizing  square miles and the americans  square miles in both cases most of this mileage was taken from people who were not of anglosaxon heritage we had now entered the time of the weak presidents they were men about whom nothing much can be said except that they did the best they could they were probably better officers in the union army than they were politicians except cleveland and arthur who had not seen military service the  major political parties that had crossed the horizon since  were almost down to the two major parties of today immigration to the united states was reaching floodtide and the oppressed europeans became an american with a vengeance while the south was recapturing the political machinery the negro had held for only a brief time in the north a new kind of politics came into being the   «   m   local politician the district leader became the hyphenated americans pipe line to direct political action the new american countedsometimes even if he lay dead under a tombstone negro americans lost all voice in the politics of the south and therefore in the nation and as a result a century and four years after the emancipation proclamation the politics of the south remain unrepresentative of all the people of that region that condition does not hurt the south or hurt the blacks alone it wounds all of us and the larger wound is perhaps still to come consider that tonight in the south or in one of the northern ghettos there is a negro boy or girl who given the chance could find a cure for cancer the political action of the south created a political reaction in the north to which the negro fled southern political imbalance is being balanced out in the great cities of this nation and as whites leave those cities for the suburbs the blacks more and more are being left behind to determine the politics of cities like new york chicago detroit and san francisco and the more they determine politics the more sullen grows the rest of the nation this as history has proved and is proving still is traditional there is something about nonwhite people holding power that makes us terribly uneasy close to the turn of the century we once again took advantage of someone elses misfortune flexed our muscle and went in to help the little guy weve always managed to come out with more than we went in with this time it was the spanishamerican war we began our history there as a world power an empire we hadnt had a decent war in  years and we were looking for one the insurrection of the cubans against spain gave us that opportunityand the explosion aboard the maine now considered to have been an accidentto enter the war on the side of the rebels we came out of that war with cuba puerto rico guam and the philippines we returned cuba to the spanish and since we were now in business in the pacific we picked up the hawaiian islands which by now were americandominated anyway some of our troops stationed in the philippines made a trip to the chinese mainland in  to help put down the boxer rebellion the boxers resented the empress dowager tzu hsi and the foreigners she allowed to run the bulk of commerce in china the boxers whose name translated from the chinese means league of the united patriots killed several hundred foreigners therefore we joined the english russian german french and japanese armies to force the chinese to let us conduct business in their land the white nations allowed japan to participate in this business deal because the japanese were militarily strong the strongest nation in the east in another four years japan was destined to win a war with russiasomething the combined armies of europe under napoleon couldnt do the nations of the west were astounded but they recovered quickly enough to limit drastically the war claims of japan implanting in that nation a sense that it would never be dealt with fairly in the courts of the western governments in  japan became a major nonanglosaxon military power and as the years wore on it was with some relief that the nations in the west let it work off its muscle in asia but first there was world war i a war we were drawn into not because we wanted to save european democracy as well as ours which in reality did not exist for millions of americans black and white and brown anyway but because we resented the efforts of the germans to loose not only the mexicans but the japanese upon us our president mr wilson feared the yellow peril as much as it intrigued kaiser wilhelm and after all we had treated the mexicans badly enough to fear that given the chance they would retaliate in kind eventually our policy of neutrality severely tested in many incidents finally had to go by the board and so we went to the war what was that war all about we know of the balance of power of assassinations of diplomatic skullduggery but was the war fought for pieces of europe really yes the germans did want to move south and east yes the russians did want to protect their black sea ports yes the french wanted to regain alsace and lorraine the japanese who came in on the side of the allies in  still wanted manchuria however dr w e b du bois the late negro scholar and historian asserted that the real spoils of victory lay in africa not in europe african possessions gave a great amount of wealth to france england belgium and germany the slave trade had been the springboard by which england and then france came to their industrial revolutions and later imports from africa costing almost nothing to produce became major underpinnings in the economies of the european nations italy had a small colony in africa belgium spain and portugal held territories germany held lands in the east southwest and west nearly all the possessions were many times larger than the nations that owned them the congo for example was  times larger than belgium and you could put france into algeria about five times africas a big place you can put the united states into it more than three times over the great rift valley in africa is longer than the united states is wide it was from the black mother that america secured its uranium which would light the sky over hiroshima and nagasaki in  ten million people died in world war i in which almost  american negro troops participated on a segregated basis the austrohungarian empire was broken up at the wars end and it became a series of feeble countries austria hungary czechoslovakia yugoslavia poland was declared independent rumania got a part of the old empire france got alsace and lorraine italy was given a bit of the rugged although very beautiful land north of its own boundary but these gifts had been gifts before in other times in short they were merely changing hands once again historian milton meltzer describes the end of the war when the negro soldiers returned homethe sound rolled up fifth avenue gathering power at every block the crowds packed on the sidewalks began to cheer as soon as the wave of noise hit their ears by the time they could see the two thousand gleaming bayonet tips far down the street they were yelling their welcome    new yorks negro soldiers were back home the first american troops to go up front they stayed in the trenches  consecutive days not one man was captured not one trench was surrendered not one foot of ground was given up    they fought their way to the rhine    they were the first american soldiers to win the highest french decoration the croix de guerre    the entire regiment won it for gallantry under fire the next day a negro was lynched in georgia two negroes were lynched every day of that year which was  nothing had changed for the negro but big changes were taking place in africa germany lost its colonies and they were taken over by the british and french and south africans japan did not receive the balance of manchuria instead it was given mandates over some islands of the pacific we would not know the names of those islands until world war ii mandates through the league of nations were a big item everyone got them on the other hand had germany won the war its new african colonies from france and england added to those it already held might have made unnecessary the quest for living space which led to the second world war ill make a flat prediction right now in the years ahead the dominant foreign influence in africaunless africa resists that intervention more strongly than it now iswill not be american or russian it will be german in the bewildering void being created between the americans and the russians the germans not the chinese are winning friends and influencing people the italians gained nothing new in africa for their service with the allies which was precisely why they returned to ethiopia in  after having been beaten by the ethiopians in  haile selassie is still the emperor of ethiopia in  when i was ten years old there was a lot in the papers and on the radio about selassie and most of it was funny there was nothing funny about his going before the league of nations to protest italian activity on his borders the league sat on its hands and the italians invaded from a distance of  years one can see that that action was a turning point in world history the sanctions the league applied to italy were useless the unwillingness and inability of the league to take meaningful action against italy finally broke that organization which was weak to begin with because we were not a member it can be assumed that if ethiopia had been a white nation the issue might have been better resolved as for us we wouldnt have cared less the degree to which white america oppressed the negro was astounding as horrible as were the deaths of the three civil_rights workers in neshoba county mississippi in  and two of them were white you will recall believe me when i tell you that they died easily compared to the way a multitude of negroes were dying in the american south in the year  we are above all racially consistent the spanish civil war began the following year and the league was unable to prevent the germans and italians from joining the conflict on the side of the monarchists we continued our isolationist binge choosing only to harass those americans who fought with the loyalists spain you see is where africa begins according to the seasoned traveller as far as the british are concerned the niggers begin at calais so the anglosaxons were pretty cool about what was going on in that latin country we watched divebombing tactics being perfected at guernica and believed they had nothing whatsoever to do with us the spanish people had elected a republican government and it was substituted in blood for an unlawful one which we have supported so we came still unprepared to world war ii we would go up against the blooded legions of the germans italians and japanesefor the japanese were finally taking the manchuria that neither the treaty of in which president teddy roosevelt was involvednor participation in world war i brought them like most western nations we were content to let the japanese and chinese fight it out what did it matter to us what those wiley oriental gentlemen did to each other as long as they didnt rock our boat while they were doing it ethiopia spain manchuria the great american depression inevitably there was hitler and the japanese militarists this time the japanese threat to our west coast was real so we went to war it is quite possible that if the japanese hadnt attacked pearl harbor we might not have gone to war despite the feeling of many government officials that we should have even before our navy was wrecked we didnt seem to care about hitlers camps or the ovens that would start snuffing out the lives of millions of people because they were jews communists homosexuals or antinazis we appeared to be content to stay in isolation lynching negroes oppressing mexicans and puerto ricans and working our way out of the depression hours after the attack on pearl harbor this nation came alive like a raging lion never again would we be isolated from the rest of the world we had at that time our finest hourand our worst we were at the same time heroes and racists while some americans were signing up others moved rapidly to isolate the japaneseamericanswe put over  in camps confiscated their property and all too often divided it among ourselves but we were also at war with germany and italy from  to  there were more german immigrants to america than from any other nation italians made up six per cent of the population in new york new jersey and connecticut in new york and a few other large cities pronazi germanamericans paraded openly in the street and yet to the endless shame of this nation we imprisoned only the japaneseamericans why didnt we imprison german and italianamericans as well we know the reason for that dont we then we had the gall the absolute gall to ask the japaneseamericans to volunteer for combat in order to prove they loved this nation and damned if they didnt volunteer the nd regiment made up of japaneseamericans became the most decorated regiment in the army in world war ii we only had gall they had manhood as we all know after the blitzkrieg that brought europe to its knees the war continued on in north africa now all europe was hurting allied strategy first recommended that the attack be carried to hitlers fortress europe directly but that was changed and the battlefield became africa because the allies could not afford to let the germans hold it africa was the place where the european allies would have to begin anew if england fell we know that the french for a time did have their military headquarters there so once again africa became a focal point for the survival of western civilization from african victories the allies sprang to italy from italy into france and then on into germany in the pacific we fought a race war against the japanese and they fought one against us surely on the basis of our previous contacts with them wed given them few reasons to trust anglosaxons we did not try to hide our contempt for them and in the end against the advice of albert einstein we dropped the bomb on them yes we dropped the bomb on them and i believe that every nonwhite person on this miserable globe of ours is convinced that had the bomb been ready before the european war was over we still would have dropped it on the japanese and not the germans the japanese after all are not white they are not anglosaxon or caucasian seven hundred thousand american negro troops were engaged in the war against the italians germans and japanese again on a segre gated basis i was one of them we were lynched in the training camps set aside from white americans we were refused food in the restaurants of the south while german prisoners of war were welcomed with the battle of the bulge however out of necessity once more the army ground forces in europe became somewhat integrated it looked as though the germans were about to break through and every available man was needed with the war won we found ourselves the undisputed leaders of the world we were not used to such power such vast influence and we handled it like a hot potatowhich was exactly what it was roosevelt was dead and truman stood in his place the result of the might of the south no northern president could be elected unless his vice president was a southerner or a border state resident or a man whose policies indicated sympathy for the southern way of life these men who have run our nationand you think about this came to their power because of their positionshinted stated or unstatedon the racial dilemma of this land that has been going on for a long long time in my opinion harry truman proved to be a better president than we had a right to expect he did make decisions he ordered the bomb dropped he put in motion the marshall plan he offered some of the firstpostwar civil_rights legislation and for his pains the southerners created their dixiecrat party of  this party was but one more product of american racial attitudes europe was in shambles but they didnt care much about that the bomb had been dropped and that didnt bother them too much but when it came to equality for the black american they really lost their cool as this socalled negro revolution ebbs and flows politicians are using it to advance themselves and to retard the country lets not be deceived by the slogans of nullification states rights crime in the streets and hoodlumism they all mean the same thing no equality for the negro as an american i would think that many other americans would grow sick and tired of what these attitudes have done to the nation and the world i would be tired of the cottonaccented or general americanaccented tones that mouth the outmoded concept of black inferiority i would be tired of the bilbos and faubuses the doubletalking northerners i would throw up my hands at the farce being perpetrated against the people of alabama today and quite possibly the rest of the nation tomorrow george and lurleen wallace however you slice it owe their doubtful preeminence to racial hatred and this hatred is a thing which act by act situation by situation has become a functioning and necessary part of our national psyche after the war we set up nato we were one of fourteen nations  we had to carry the other  the taxes of all americans went to europe to save it from communism we were so busy in europe that we almost forgot about our adventures in china and the rest of the orient we had to think about it again because the regime of chiang kai shek was that year swept to formosa by the communists once again we had backed the wrong horse i have mentioned the boxer rebellionthat was when the chinese man in the street rebelled against outsiders capturing the commercial interests of his country we first went to china in  following the opium wars in  when  was a kid there were a great many movies about the chinese being opium fiends they were the guys who when high on opium kidnapped the blonde blueeyed girls you know the bit the opium wars you may remember began because the british imported opium into china from places like burma the chinese government knew very well what opium could do to its people and resisted the british insisted on bringing it inat great cost to the chinese the chinese lost those wars opium not only flowed freely through the provinces but england france and the us were given freedom to call at the treaty ports of shanghai canton and others britain also gained hong kong it was a case of the west ramming down the throat of the east not what was good for the orientals but what was good and damned profitable for caucasians in washington dc the newsmen still remember with great fondness the china lobby of chiang kai shek it gave the most splendid parties in town girls booze and excellent chinese food were available for the asking only in  did it become crystal clear that chiang was through we woke up late surprisingly late to the information that people who were not white could adopt a modern social order such as communism and when we did wake up we didnt know where to begin as late as  when african nations were becoming independent we still didnt know what to do so we reverted we tried to pay africa and africans as we have done with the rest of the world to play ball with us but in china there were now about  million souls ruled by a political philosophy that was alien to us counting russia far over a billion ideological enemies not counting the sovietbloc nations so seven years after we signed the nato pact we had to go to manila and draw up a similar contract with eight nations this time we called the contract the southeast asia treaty organization and it was signed in  the same year that france also a member of seato was concluding its war in vietnam one year before we had reached an uneasy truce in korea what an odd lot that seato organization brought together america with her domestic racial problems and a neophyte in world relations which added up to insincerity and fumbling in our comer were the philippines a very obvious us satellite in the pacific there was france just beaten in vietnam splendidly democratic at home but its racial policies abroad left much to be desired great britain was there of course with two members of the commonwealth australia and new zealand australias racial policies were approaching those of south africa and our own american south then there was pakistan and thailand the pakistani people feel the brunt of much of the british racism when they are in england the great powers of the west sat down with these little countries and wrote out a pacific charter affirming the rights of asian and pacific peoples to equality and selfdetermination the antiaggression and economic provisions were extended in vietnam we were building a ring around china then just as we had created a ring of allies around russia we thought we could isolate communism shut it off from the rest of asia and the world we had discovered during the korean war that we were faced with an implacable enemy a people who were glad to build our railroads do our laundry and serve fortune cookies in cute little restaurants smelling of strange teas but no more korea was first colonized by the chinese in the th century and down through the years both the chinese and japanese fought over it the japanese took it over as a result of their war with russia korea was promised to the chinese during the cairo conference in  but when the war was over the country was occupied by the americans in the south and the russians in the north then governments were set up north and south the rest is history we went to war there with our first integrated army and with the aid of united nations troops the war was a draw the country is still divided at the th parallel we began to form rings around china and there was much talk about the implausibility of conducting a land war in china we hoped and prayed that the yellow heathenthat is save chiang kai shek whom we were still supporting on formosawould not get their hands on the knowhow to make the bomb we still had that advantage i am an american seven generations in this land i am an afroamerican if you will i am a student of history a victimas we all areof life i am a father and husband and i am a writer and i believe a responsible citizen therefore what i have to say next i do not say lightly most americans have never been troubled by the great gap between the american creed and the american deed and i do not believe my words are going to change things one bit i wish they could but i know they wont it seems that all the words have been used upused so often that we respond only to the sound and not the meaning of them the american history of racism it is my firm conviction and i have tried to give a sketch of it has brought us today to a confrontation with deadly possibilities not with north vietnam but with china it is not the philosophy of communism that we fear any longer one has only to witness the degree to which we have managed to coexist with it and even managed to thrive because of it we have had opportunities to crush it we were in russia during world war i only when we were in danger in world war ii did we help them weve always gotten along well with tito the hungarians expected us to return to europe when they revolted but we didnt what makes us uneasy about the philosophy of communism is that it has great appeal with some modification to strange people like the dominicans cubans and africans but we can put up with them because after all they have not got the bomb the chinese have got the bomb they have got the bomb and this means that for the first time in history people who are not white are capable of administering almost as much death and destruction as white people the balance no longer is no white nation on this earth can claim to have been nice to the mainland chinese none and now we may force them to seek redress of grievances before i finish with china however let me go to south vietnam we have almost half a million troops there as far as we have been told and close to  of them are negro many others are puerto rican a goodly number are rural white kids from the south ask a soldier what he is doing in vietnam and hell probably tell you hes defending freedom and democracy how dare we in the year  with the socalled negro revolution climbing right up our backs and threatening to rip this country apart talk of freedom and democracy in vietnam there must be places within  miles of most of us now where a negro gi just back from vietnam cannot stop to eat or sleep i know there are where i come from what are we doing in vietnam when here at home  out of every thousand black babies die within a year of life while in vietnam  out of every thousand die what are we doing burning homes children women and the aged who did not ask us to come in the first placeall they wish is relief from their landlords and why are black gis dying at the rate of  per cent of the total casualties while making up only a bit over  per cent of the population many of those boys have died without having a cup of watery coffee in an integrated five and dime storeso that many americans can have the privilege of exercising a sickening item called white backlash so what are we doing there involved in an undeclared war and without our major allies france and england this war is without slogans because the real reason for it is rooted in what we say we despise race hatred we are trying to draw china into a war i believe i think we have come to believe that we must before china finds the capability for delivering its bomb to the american mainlandor to russiawho one day will be our major ally vietnam is nothing it is an expensive excuse nothing more how can we be concernedhow can the vietnamese in the south expect us to be concernedwith their distant  people when we have amply demonstrated to the entire world and for over  years time and time again that we do not basically care for the black and brown millions in our own midst what we want is for the chinese to reach over and knock the chip from our shoulder wed like them to invade the south but if they dont we might invade the north and try to draw them down but they are sly yellow devils arent they they wont bite because they know that if they do we might unsheath a few of those metal monsters we will keep escalating until they do bite because we insist we have got to get them before they get us white power not yellow power must prevail and we have a justifiable sense of guilt about what we have done to the nonwhite world we just dont want to pay for it but nature contains its own awful balance john a williams author of the article race war and politics is one of americas leading novelists his newest book the man who cried l am which was completed in spain last winter is scheduled for publication this fall last spring his expanded and updated anthology beyond the angry black was published mr williams other books include the novels sissie and night song and the autobiographical travel book this is my country too the above article was delivered as an address at colorado state university
 i talk to friendly white people for the first e f time or for any length of time and often when i talk to f young black people and usually when i talk to anybody ab°ut the blues i realize the vast and tragic gaps in our c understanding of the negro experience in america this is particularly evident in the current misunderstanding of the nature and dimensions of black consciousness one aspect of which black_power has received inordinatebecause distortedattention from the mass media it strikes me as strange that there should be such misunderstanding of black aspiration from literate people who really should know better for this insistence upon black consciousness of which black_power is a solid but flashy single factor is not unconnected with what has gone on before and what in effect has been sanctioned before by the literate public for example when richard wright said that he was a black boy and delineated that condition and refused to be a nigger when ralph ellison said that he was an invisible man when james baldwin said that nobody knew his name they spoke in powerful and moving and eminently distinctive voices for when wright asserted his blackness and repudiated his niggerness it was an act of personal purgation when ellison said that he was invisible it was an indictment and a challenge and when baldwin said that nobody knew his name it was a warning one need not belabor baldwins prophetic precision when this juxtaposition is obvious the fire next time burn baby burn or the fact that wright used the words black_power as the title for a book which in its reflection of essentially a white mans view of africa revealed the price he paid for integration and the repudiation of his niggerness or that ironically ellison was making invisibility a metaphor for blackness and incidentally for niggerness and black consciousness or that the whole socalled black movement on the social and political level at least is a series of exercises in strategic visibility or as ellison and leroi jones say so well black is blue the paradigm of the negro experience is the blues but when people talk about blues they usually talk about sociology or personal anecdote or about music usually jazz i submit that while it involves all these things it is also poetry at times of great profundity and if we examined it as such we would find out that black consciousness has been around for a long time and is likely not only to endure but to seducewhich is to say to prevail i have used the words nigger and niggerness in the same breath with black consciousness and i am pretty sure that most people who talk about black consciousness would probably repudiate any connection of this sort yet oddly enough these same people are searching for their roots in the folk culture of which the blues are a crucial part and the main burden of the blues is doing it and dues now all white people know that negroes are sexual prodigies though only a few white people know what negroes mean by paying dues schwerner and goodman and reeb and mrs liuzzo knew too well now white people also know what they mean when they say nigger after all they invented the word and the thing for a refresher here is a letter to eugene patterson the editor from the october   issue of the atlanta constitution in  when the students of virginia union university began picketing the stores with lunchcounters in downtown richmond someone sent the president a picture of a black gorilla charging through the african bush scrawled in huge letters were the words nigger this is you meanwhile in the newspapers the good people of virginia vented their venom while editorials spoke in unsubtle praise of carlton putnams race and reason in short a nigger is a bom halfape in hitlers phrase with rheumatism in all his joints and of course niggers are diseased and depraved something like swifts yahoos and they stink so as the american nazis say who needs niggers who indeed ask the old negro and he replies nobody and he tells his children stop acting like niggers and when he is disgusted with his folks he says just like niggers yet he also uses the word in a neutral sense to mean negro or as a term of affection to his very dear friend or even his wife warily he may allow his white friends to use the word in his presence to show that he is integrated sometimes in a kind of brotherly euphoria he even allows a special white friend jokingly to call him nigger who needs niggers ask the young blackman and he might cuss you out or knock you down no more of that never no goddamn more and he reminds you of the young richard wright yet the young blackman uses the word too quite often in the same manner that the old negro does though if he is a young blackman and not just a young negro chances are few white people even his closest friends would dare call him nigger and when he calls himself that or his friends there is an ironic distance in his voice which calibrates precise emotional reactions as in his use of the shortened form nig or the nig moreover despite his highly specialized use of the term and his repudiation of the white mans definition the young blackman in his concern with shattering stereotypes either consciously or unconsciously ventures into forms of speech dress and behavior which would elicit from the old negro the expression of resigned self contempt just like a nigger and in attempting to assert his independence of the white man in declaring his freedom as a natural man he deliberately courts at times it seems the white mans scorn so as to declare it irrelevant to his personal worth and freedom and so the repudiation of black and white middleclass values alike he takes a long hard look as it were at the idea of niggerness and because it embodies some of the deepest fears of western white men he discovers that it is useful he can use it as the basis of a new concept of self he can not only use it as the old negro did he can also use it as a weaponagainst the physical ghetto yes whether you condone his actions or not but also and more importantly against the ghettos of the mind and so in turning back to his roots as he says it he challenges the stereotypes sometimes he transforms them and with this transformation comes change in others around him old negroes and whitefolks alike he doesnt have to turn far before he comes to the blues the devil songs of doing it and dues for in them he finds the ancestral record of otherness or if you please of niggerness 
i have isolated vhnt i consider to be the main burden or themes of the bluesphysical iove with or without romance and suffering or doin it and dues a good example of what im talking about is a blues by furry lewis the great memphis blues singer and teacher of bessie smith he sings in white lightnin
this is a very moving and typical blues some of it consists of standard blues lines which furry has assimilated and appropriated for his own use but the juxtaposition and the powerful condensation of feeling make it quite personal in the opening lines the terrible and paradoxical words reflect a mental state quite close to the alienation so often expressed in modem literature fix my breakfast so i can go to bed hes been up all night drinking trying to cure the blues we dont know what the cause is but it seems a fundamental despair both physical and philosophical so powerful that he has tried to erase it with the alcohol how appropriately then the name suits the mood and the stunning effect of the alcohol is like the paralyzing force of the blues themselves he has suffered as it were a double strokefrom the blues and from the white lightnin the next logical step physically should be sleep metaphysically death since the words are announced with all the anguish of physical and spiritual exhaustion before the second stanza he plays a boogiewoogie figure the music of copulation which announces a different kind of resolution and the language following after typical blues boasting standard blues lines implies a paradoxical and witty comment on the original mood suddenly he revives from the blue paralysis and is readyto take on a chocolate broad any one but the lines imply that he is already riding and what hes hauling is his own sweet chocolate which has burst through the paralysis as his life revives but the fear of the blues is there even in the act of regeneration it has made and will make him so desperate that he will do everything he can for the woman be good to her and for her then the boogiewoogie ride is over and the same train that hauled chocolate to the bone takes her away from him literally and logically there are inconsistencies of person and tense which confuse the literal meaning the baby in the first stanza is probably not the same as in the fifth and we moved from the immediate opening mood and place home in the present to another location in the present where he is trying to get someone to go home with him to still another place in the present presumably home where he mourns over someone who had left him in the past but the unity is one of mood and one which follows the laws of associationfrom the paralysis of the first two stanzas to the sexual solution of the three middle stanzas to the resignation of the last which implies a groping for something beyond love and an acceptance of the impermanence of love it takes us to the mysterious despair of the opening  this obviously is not a mere longing for sex since the woman is already there so what then is this terrible despair that drives a man to oblivion it is the blues the characteristic cumulative effect of blackness in the united states its not just the background of jazz not just a sound the brown sound of the british rock and rollers nor simply a hybrid music which gropes for the quarter tones of african modalities nor is it a simple record of the more palatable and romantic aspects of blackness the soul of black folks in america it is again the characteristic effect of blackness in the united states and blackness in the united states means niggernessand niggerness is among other things a diseasethe disease of absurd otherness and the blues song is an existential record both of the symptoms and of the treatment it is a kind of homeopathya treatment of poisoning with a bit of the poison itself the live virus that makes the vaccine work thus any serious search for roots and black identity has to come fully to grips with this experience not just to isolate it and forget it but to incorporate it into a larger conception of self now make no mistake about it the blues experience this niggerness is a terrible disease it can kill dont sentimentalize that furry doesnt its a disease that lurks dormant in the blood even when apparently cured like malaria or syphillis and the price of the cure is so painful so great that you wouldnt in your right mind go out and catch it again now if this scourge this blues this niggerness is so terrible if it has been inflicted upon us for all these years if it has infected the whole social and political body of this country and damaged its soul in the process and if we have survived because we were too damn mean to crynot only because we got good religion but because we got good bread then we shouldnt ever forget the experience because it is a part of our uniqueness we shouldnt ever forget the experiences of niggerness the whole range of it if anything we should celebrate it ritualistically as the jews do passover or yom kippur if we are to be whole as a people we must in our new black pride as young black folks seem unconsciously to be doing acknowledge the full nature of the disease and transform it not pretend that it never existed for if it had never existed we never would have developed immunity there is a good deal of glib talk nowadays about telling it like it is often by people who dont know what it is and increasingly young black people will be unable to see it like it is because their music will have had its vitality filtered through fashionable mainstream interpretations and they themselves will as they attain middle class respectability theorize and romanticize the guts out of their ancestral experience in this country precisely at a time when it needs to be remembered they have to remember again the entire spectrum of blacknessthe negative part in the mind of white america and the selfhatred the selfabnegation the selfsurrender the selfrealization in their own anything less than this      m   and it has to be held simultaneously in the mindis less than the truth if its less than truth then its not whole but unhealthy diseased at worst niggerness without the blues this takes us back to the mysterious despair of furrys first stanza for the realization of the absurdity of niggerness can come at any time it can even come in church where it may be transmuted into a longing for godbecause the mechanism is there but when the religious mechanism isnt there it comes out like it isthe blues now in their churches european people and educated negroes call their blue feeling angst and philosophize learnedly about the death of god but the blues singer knows all about that and has been saying it for a very long time he knows that angst is the blues for god but that god is white he knows absurdity with shattering intimacy he has also developed a mechanism to handle it an art form which celebrates the brutal thrust of love into the cavity of the absurd and precisely because they deal with the abyss the stinking pit of hell without the mediating presence of god precisely because they have been so efficiently and systematically rejected by the world the blues singersthe blues peoplelove and long so desperately there is for them no theological solutionno god to wipe away their tears only a train sixteen coaches long that dont haul nothin but chocolate to the bone at this point we run into a set of complications modern urban blues soul music white blues and rock and roll i believe that although the performance of the blues has changed the blues as black experience as poetry as recordhasnt by this i mean that the essential elements of doin it and dues are still there though perhaps in different proportions there is in effect much more of the former than of the latter especially in white singing which is often a kind of debasement a kind of shamminginstant anguish and perpetual orgasm but the same can be said of many negro presentations which tend toward artiness and prettiness and pop appeal but b b king and ray charles especially and now james brown otis redding and aretha franklinthey know about dues too and though their appeal rests largely on their virtuosityso did that of bessie smith and jimmy rushing and blind lemon jefferson and dinah washingtontheir story is still the story of the blues the disease and the serum finally it is important to make these distinctions now because the blues element in current soul music is so often swamped by the superficial adaptations of gospel rhythms melodies and lyrics and with the insistent imitation of negro sound by skillful whites the whole value structure implicit in the words of the blues is threatened for america has the midas touch which turns blue notes into goldleaf before the blues are pressed like childs english and scottish popular ballads into five static and esoteric volumes let us realizeespecially you young blackman bluethat their tragicomic vitality can still save us from cynical political posturing from the hoppedup rhetoric of brotherhood from the saccharine confusions of adrenalin and soul 
a strong case could be a  p made for the hypothe£ sis that popular social  movements do not apjzai£ss ik pear unty gai s to which they address themselves are already in the process of being achieved put another way it may be suggested that changes in the afroamerican freedom movement have followed rather than preceded changes in the situation of black people for as the political economic and social conditions of black people have improved so has the movement gained momentum and become negro digest august  more articulate sophisticated and complex the absoluteif not relative conditions of black people have indeed improved and this absolute improvement is at the very basis of the increasing momentum of the movement for to be sure throughout our history black people have known disadvantages and deprivation but in the face of it and in spite of it enough have managed to secure educations hold jobs move to greener pastures and increase our numbers to advance the absolute condition of the group parallel to this advance can be traced the rise of a positive black consciousness that found expression in a direct assault on segregation in the civil_rights movement and in the call for black_power with each change in the character of the movement has come an enlargement of its objectives and with each improvement in life conditions has come new insights into the nature of our situation and problems having secured a reaffirmation of our civil_rights we can see that these in themselves are not enough for we have also advanced far enough to clearly see that while our absolute situation has improved our group as a whole is not progressing as rapidly as others and that our people and communities face relative stagnation this realization of group stagnation in the face of individual advancement has contributed to a heightening of black consciousness and to a new change in the course of the movement an unmistakeable indicator of this change of course has been the emergence of the slogan black_power the slogan served brilliantly to dramatize one of the fundamental aspects of the realities that face black people in the united states that of relative powerlessness in a society that is organized upon power manipulation the emergence of such a captivating slogan represents an important phase of a group movement yet even the most brilliant slogan suffers a sever limitation a slogan directs attention to a situation or a set of objectives but it cannot provide the guidelines by which the objectives embodied in the slogan may be achieved to bring forth these guidelines we must bring forth an ideology for while a slogan draws attention to a reality and sounds a call for action an ideology provides a framework that integrates concepts ideas means and ends  into a program for action in this respect black_power can be viewed as a slogan of the ideology of black nationalism black_power has become a household phrase and like most slogans it has come to mean many different and often contradictory things in the minds of many black people the differing opinions and contradictions nonetheless must be viewed as unavoidable necessary and even desirable for the unleashing of this particular slogan has initiated a great debate among black people which holds the promise of enlightening and of resolving many of the dilemmas that plague even the most resolute among us yet again if this debate is to prove fruitful we must move beyond the slogan to the development of a viable ideology it is in the spirit of this great debate that this essay embraces the slogan black_power and argues in favor of pluralistic black nationalism as an ideology to serve the needs of black people in the united states historically and geographically nationalism has been interpreted and modified to meet the particular conditions of particular times and places the basic concept in nationalistic ideologies has been that members of a group however defined believe that they themselves should control and manage their own affairs at the risk of oversimplification we will define afroamerican black nationalists as those who wish to preserve and develop black communities and institutions in both a physical and spiritual sense those who wish to maximize black political economic and social power in order to control protect and enhance black communities institutions and black people those who wish to conserve create and protect the integrity of black culture and those who view their identity proudly and positively put simply we define pluralistic black nationalism as positive black consciousness expressed in institutional and structural terms in using this formulation it becomes obvious that we are suggesting a new definition of black nationalismor and perhaps more accurately we are suggesting a new application of the concept this application of black nationalism includes many black people who do not think of themselves as black nationalists but whose actions and sentiments are nationalistic within the confines of our definition and application viewed from this perspective we can see that black nationalism has had a long history among afroamericans in terms of organized movements this history can be traced from the emigration movements of the early nineteenth century to marcus garvey in the s to the nation of islam today yet also using our definition and application we find a definite motif of undefined black nationalism which expressed itself in black consciousness and concern and reached its high points in the convention movements of the s in the black literary renaissance of the s and in the intellectual political cultural social and economic ferment that is today transforming black america throughout the great debate black_power and black nationalism have been equated with the notion of a physical separation of black people from the united states this is an overly narrow view and does not apply to the main body of nationalistic sentiment among afroamericans which seeks to participate more fully in the total society this narrow view is based upon the false assumption that nationalism refers only to nationstate creation or affairs nationalism however can also apply to the desire for nationality group unity and it can exist when a multiplicity of nationality groups share the same country beyond the situation in the united states this multiplicity of nationality groups can also be seen in the cases of the frenchcanadians and the greekcypriots most importantly then while nationalist movements may or may not be separatist they may also be nonseparatist or pluralist moreover as c eric lincoln put it black nationalism addresses itself not to an existent state but a state of mind and it is in terms of a pluralist american society that black nationalism is here discussed in ideal terms a pluralist society may be thought of as one where distinct groups peacefully coexist within a country on a basis of mutual cooperation respect and civil equality each group may maintain a set of institutions parallel to those of other groups through which it may pursue its own needs and cultural interests so long as these pursuits do not encroach upon the civil_rights of other groups yet we must not view pluralistic black nationalism as a variation of the separate but equal theme for quite the contrary pluralistic nationalism aims at complete desegregationnot segregation a pluralistic society is completely compatible with the principles and spirit of democracy for pluralism affirms democracy just as segregation repudiates it a pluralistic black nationalism ideology offers means ends and programs commensurate with the needs for structural and institutional development in the black communities our arguments for such an ideology stem from a consideration of the nature of black communities their relationships to other communities and their problems afroamericans constitute a virtual nation within a nation this can easily be seen objectively by noting the various indexes of segregation which show that residential neighborhoods are becoming increasingly homogenous in their racial compositions equally visible are the black institutions associations and organizations which exist parallel to those of whites and other racial groups these structural features serve to show that to a great extent american society is organized upon the basis of race and ethnicity for it is common practice to define political units school districts and economic markets in terms of the racial and ethnic composition of the residential neighborhoods and communities within them yet black communities and the institutions organizations and structures within them are underdeveloped and beset with a whole range of problems these problems are grounded in the structural features of american society to use an analogy in many ways the relationships between black and white communities are similar to those between neighboring countries and to carry the analogy a step further these relationships are like those between the highly developed and the still developing countries of the world but we must not carry the analogy of neighboring countries too far we exist in one country actually and contrary to popular opinion black people are not outside the mainstream of american society we are very much a part of and influenced by the structure of this society but as a group we are near the bottom of it we are prisoners of it and we are stagnating and very nearly drowning in its vicious structural cycles thus our problems stem from our relative position in the society not our membership in it the issue which confronts us is not one of choosing between participation in the mainstream of american society and developing our own communities for we must do both at the same time rather the issue is given our historical and present position what form should our relationships to the rest of this society take we choose to face this issue by arguing for pluralistic black nationalism on the basis of three of many reasons first this society is structured around groups and the strength they can muster other groups have already used their own nationalism to advance their groups position second for black people the methods available for advancement are all qualified by the racism that pervades the entire society any plan any coalition must take this racism into consideration black nationalism offers the advantage of ever reminding us to maximize our own strength in order that we may relate to others from a position of relative independence rather than near absolute dependence third black nationalism as we have defined itblack consciousness expressed in structural and institutional termsis in keeping with our situation needs and goals men pursue their goals through institutions organizations and structures to change our relative position in the structure of this society we must create larger more comprehensive and modern institutions of our own and in our own communities the structural features of american society have held us in a vicious cycle of stagnation therefore we need structures of our own to break out of the cycle and move ahead at a pace comparable to the rest of the society if black communities are to develop and prosper black consciousness must be channeled into viable structures and institutions for in this highly organized society an unorganized people can exert little influence but paradoxically all the ingredients for the development of viable institutional and organizational structures now exist in black communities except for a broadly based and widely understood ideology to coordinate our efforts forge the needed institutions and structures and lift our communities out of their relative stagnation we must face the unpleasant suspicion that we may have devoted more energy to attempting to enter the institutions of other groups than we have to developing our own we may have thus come perilously close to portraying ourselves as pawns rather than brokers the ingredients for development can all be foundand so can a catalystin pluralistic black nationalism despite our internal confusions and problems we are neither helpless nor inadequate to administer our own affairs our positions of powerlessness and deprivation are relative not absolute we do have both the actual and potential resources by way of example we will use the point of view of pluralistic black nationalism to explore two of the many potential areas of black development politics on the level of local organization and economic development in the retail sector pluralistic black nationalism and local political development politics have proven to be the most successful weapon in our black_power arsenal and its impact has been greatest on the local level black people are concentrated in the urban areas thus it has been in the city governments that black people have come closest to achieving the ideal of a pluralist societyproportional representation in the centers of power for example black people represent about  per cent of the united states population but only  per cent of the federal con gressmen are black yet if we examine a local level such as in cleveland ohio we find that black people comprise about  per cent of the citys population and hold onethird of the city council seats thus on the federal level our power is more or less symbolic but on many local levels black political power is real and significanteven if not always decisive conditions of the times dictate that we must move from strength to success to do this we must accelerate the development of the local or grass roots base of our political power local governments in nearly all cases create control and administer school systems zoning and housing codes welfare programs refuse collection and many other daytoday government services local governments ultimately determine where new streets will be built or not built where housing codes are enforced or not enforced police policies and the nature of the local tax base these matters play a major role in the lives and development of communities even when programs originate on the federal or state level they are usually administered in the local level many of the problems which plague black communities can be traced to the decisions and policies of local government these range from overcrowded schools and housing to zoning decisions that can quickly undermine black property values deteriorate black neighborhoods and create slums black political power applied to the local government level is obviously one of the means by which black communities can attack problems and protect their interests and pluralistic black nationalism is an ideology to make the connection between often obscure government decisions and the wellbeing of black communities unfortunately the importance of local politics and local government is sometimes overlooked black politicians are almost universal in noting that while the situation is improving black political organizations still suffer from a lack of yearround community participation funds organizers and candidates who are willing to run for officeparticularly local office the qualified people exist but the importance of local organization and of capturing local offices is too often not fully appreciated and as a political leader in houston texas observed black people vote the right way when they vote the point is that effective political organization requires much more than registering voters once registered black voters need information and insight into the subtleties of the issues many of the vitally important issues which have consequences for a community can easily escape the notice of the lay man if these issues are not brought to his attention and explained this is not only a question of having the leaders who are alert to the issues it is also a question of having the channels of communication for disseminating the information and this is a function of effective organization we have achieved some successes through politics but in the light of the problems that still face us despite these successes we must continue to develop our political potential and forge it into effective organizations and to do this we must have a reference frame from which we can recognize consider and evaluate the issues and decisions which influence our lives and we must have a comprehensive program for action pluralistic black nationalism meets both of these needs pluralistic black nationalism and retail ecoiqmic develop  ment   in the field of economic development pluralistic black nationalism is a particularly useful approach to channeling black consciousness into institutional structures for as we noted above the powerlessness of black people is relative not absolute just as we carry political ballots that are significant so too we carry potentially effective economic ballots in the form of our consumption and investment dollars in terms of developing black communities how and where a black man spends his dollars are just as important as how he votes for by investing our consumer and investment capital in our own communities we can generate additional resources reduce unemployment and increase our selfsufficiency and freedom as long as we are a part of this society we should be full members of its economic common market along with the other nationality groups and we should enjoy the mutual benefits of our common membership yet black communities resemble still developing countries with balanceoftrade problems too much of our communities resources flow outward this trend must be reversed and it can be we can cast our consumer and investment ballots for our own communities perhaps we are not yet in the position to become large scale producers of goods but still we can own manage and control the retail outlets in our communities we can trade for the goods and services that we cannot produce for ourselves neither are black people penniless for indeed there is gold in the black valleysnot to mention the hills the dollars we all spend for food shelter clothing drugs gasoline etc are the dollars that can support black retail outlets and not only are there consumer dollars in the back community there are surplus dollars as well that can be wooed into capital investment to build the retail facilities the task at hand is to provide competitive and attractive consumer outlets and investment opportunities for these dollars but the age of the small individual entrepreneur is passing today economic institutions are large and corporately owned rather than attempt to develop small and marginal shops black people must and have done so create corporations on a larger and more efficient scale the attractiveness of retail development stems from the fact that many of the jobs created by it can utilize unskilled labor and thus draw upon the vast reservoir of the black unemployed retail jobs even up to the management level do not necessarily require extensive formal educations these jobs require literacy diligence and skills that can either be learned onthejob or after a short training period most black people are literate almost all are used to hard work and enough are nationally conscious of the extent that they will go out of their way to support a black business community if given good and fair service and attractive investment opportunities it is not enough to depend upon jobs in institutions industries and businesses controlled by those who live outside the black community this is not to argue that black people should not have jobs outside the black community but rather to recognize that there are not enough of them forthcoming we are all familiar with black unemployment figures and we have seen the reports which show that the average black man with some years of college education earns less than the average white man with an eighthgrade education surely part of this discrepancy stems from the fact that even after black people achieve formal educations they still suffer at the hands of white employers many black people have educations but we have failed to create enough institutions to provide us with job opportunities untouched by racism it is no accident that with the exception of entertainers the groups of black people who have done best economically are those professionals and businessmen who draw their incomes from black clients and customers it is not then enough for black people to be employees we must also be owners capital plus labor equals profit or surplus capital for the owners of the capital when this surplus capital flows out of a community stagnation results black communities will develop only as surplus capital is channeled back into them another advantage of retail development is that it is in keeping with the trends of the overall economy automation and technological advances are decreasing the relative numbers of production workers needed while at the same time raising the required educational level the big job demands of the future can be expected in the service and white collar industries which include the retail sector and in the construction trades retail development creates a demand for construction and jobs such as managers sales people service men etc and at the same time creates new clients and customers for black professionals businessmen and financial institutions most important black retail development would generate additional resources and rechannel them back into the community to stimulate further growth retail outlets are dependent upon production but the actual situation is one of mutual dependency or interdependency for as much as the retail outlets need the products of the production centers the production centers in turn need retail outlets to distribute their products an argument can even be made that the retail or consumption sector is somewhat more important in a surplus economy such as ours united states industries operate below capacity they can produce more than they can sell this means that it is usually in the interests of the producers to find new and broader retail outlets at any rate to concentrate on retail development is not to become hopelessly dependent upon producers if black people are watchful and well organized we can protect our interests maintain our independence and control our economic communities through selective buying and if need be boycotts this society is becoming increasingly conservative we black people must move on our own if we are to advance our relative position and improve our lives although some believe contrariwise it has yet to be proven that we cannot achieve our goals even within the framework of this far from perfect society if the day comes when other groups seek to openly block our advancement then we should man the barricades until that day comes we should continue to develop our potentialfor the surface has only been scratched in any event we must indeed keep the faith in ourselves in each other and in our groups capability and improvability black nationalism has been with us a long time and it is applicable to our present and future needs the point of view expressed here purports to be neither absolute nor final but it is hoped that pluralistic black nationalism will henceforth be at least one of the great debates
back in feudal times when the lowly vassal was assigned some land his lord to make sure the underling got the message of how beholden he was required the poor guy to crouch stark naked fold his hands as though praying and intone the humble vassals oath while landlords have been obliged to scratch this requirement they have jealously kept intact other lordly rights in defiance of twentieth century tenancy reality feudal custom is firmly entrenched in todays landlordtenant law especially court opinion which is the chief formulator of tenancys powers and obligations many legal experts say this centuriesold hangup is the reason slums persistently stay with us undaunted by the frenzy of renewal and code enforcement and purported tenantrelief statutes they say further that this is why rent strikes have failed to bring relief except in new york city where a unique statute permits rent withholding under certain circumstances when a rent strike reaches the court stage the judge virtually always sides with the landlord tenant abuse persists according to this view because the rental housing consumerunlike all other modem consumersis not granted power to demand his due a group of talented lawyers across the country are making a concerted effort to remould tenantshackling court opinion and one of the most vigorous is james jim herndon a young negro lawyer who practices in san francisco herndons remoulding tools are wellprepared court cases for his thrust against entrenched injustice he seeks out instances of tenant abuse that while condoned by existing court opinion are nonetheless so manifestly wrong that a judge might be moved to agree herndon will travel anywhere in california to fight a good test case the courts have got to change says the lawyer judges still see renting as a conveyance like back in feudal times when lords assigned lands to their vassals for  or  years since vassals were basically sharecroppers the landlord had absolute right to the rent it represented a share of what issued from the land if rent wasnt paid the lords agents galloped in and took it naturally it was up to the vassal to maintain the place he mended the fieldstone walls and kept up the roads when the gale carried off the roof he rethatched but todays tenant isnt sharecropping his rent issues from his pocketbook and what he bargains for and pays for is habitable living quarters facilities and services all three yet he is forced to pay the full rent even if he gets just one of these purchasesthe space herndon points out that there is no defense for nonpayment of rent summary eviction proceedings dont permit so much as a mention of a landlords default only the tenants even if an apartment were flooded or roofless or firegutted if the tenant remains on the premises he has to pay the full rent says herndon all other purchasers of a deficient productsay a car with a defective transmission can demand restitution if you order a supply of liquor and get half empty boxes you dont have to pay for the empties do you judicial bias emasculates purported tenant relief statutes herndon claims several states have authorized the tenant to spend up to a months rent in some states two to make vital repairs if the landlord wont not only is the rent money insufficient to cover most vital repairs but worse the statutes fail to define what is vital the tenant who dares spend the rent for repairs finds himself in trouble if there is no lease the landlord retaliates by evicting the tenant if a lease exists the landlord goes to court and challenges the expenditure as unnecessary and judges generally side with landlords on this point it goes likewise with the principle of constructive eviction which courts recognize in theory but rarely in practice supposedly the tenant is free to break his lease and move if the premises become uninhabitable but the wise tenant knows better just what uninhabitable means no court has decided for certain the tenant who thinks he knows and accordingly moves finds himself hailed before a judge who by habit agrees with the land lord that the tenant was overfinicky as for housing code violations when a landlord is taken to court for a citation the judge lets him off with a few dollars fine or accepts his  work permit as proof that hell correct the violation off the hook the landlord usually forgets about repairing theres a simple reason in herndons view why the landlordtenant transaction remains feudal tenants havent pled their case whereas landlords keep a legion of lawyers arguing in court to see that the law gets interpreted in their favor and the feudal way favors them those who use the law mould the law things wont change until tenants swing equal weight in court theyve got to seize the initiative aggressively defend themselves appeal landlord victories to higher courts initiate cases against landlords and fight hard to win only through this route will the rental contract become reciprocal herndon a slight handsome bachelor is a nighttime stealerinandout of drab tenant gatherings in drab settingsclusters of tiredlooking men and women under a naked light bulb in a housing project apartment or in the stark sunday school room of a slum church as familiar as his favorite jazz records are complaints of doors that wont lock toilets that wont flush drains that wont drain sometimes told in anger sometimes in tears while seeming to study his wellpolished shoes he listens for two types of situations first he detects pitfalls a tenant may be approachingsome trap that would propel him into a damage suit or even into jail while the landlord knows tenant law like the back of his hand tenant law to the average tenant is as tricky as a mine field yet slum tenants often make the leap from hopelessness to a heady assumption that because they have found company in their misery they can spit in the landlords eye to herndon falls the thankless task of throwing cold legal reality upon righteous indignation at one meeting anger was fizzing like a bicarbonate of soda a gaunt janitress whose earnings supported five children and a bedridden mother had just recounted how for months she had urged her landlord to repair a plumbing leak that soaked a wall of her mothers room after the mother became ill with pneumonia she decided to borrow  with which she had the leak repaired and purchased materials for plastering and papering the wall herself instead of thanks she got a  rent increase the landlord refused to accept the old rent she refused to pay more and now she was facing eviction the womans eyes snapped i pay my own way ill never take welfare but my pay wont stretch no further im not beat though when they come to evict us ill bar them with a shotgun my mother shouldnt be moved during this rainy season and shes not going to be herndon admired the womans spunk but he had to inform her that illness no matter how serious wouldnt stop a courtordered eviction and anyhow her mother could stand being moved in the rain better than seeing her daughter taken to jail but its robbery the woman cried im still paying off my repair loan shes right several voices chorused rip out that new plaster and wallpaper someone suggested all installations and improvements belong to the landlord herndon said with a sigh for the womans protection he persuaded her to submit but he felt angry at his profession which as propertys hireling had caused her desperation and he was angry at his helplessness to rescue her but sometimes there is a way one housing project council herndon advises staged a sitin to halt what it felt was an unfair eviction of a project family herndon theorized correctly that the city would not use force to remove sympathetic neighbors when the eviction crew arrived other project families literally packed the apartment sprawling over every bed every table the eviction crew left emptyhanded the same council successfully employed another unconventional protest method after the housing authority had refused to let them express grievances at an authority meeting the tenants barred exits at the end of the meeting and held board members captive for two startled hours forcing them to listen the tenants won several concessions but always herndon is listening for the makings of a good test case an instance of abuse that has a chance of winning relief in court such a victory is a wedgea precedent on which to build other cases he says unions and racial minorities have won significant rights through test cases that molded the law their way herndon hopes one day to persuade a judge to recognize that a rental agreement is a simple contract between buyer and seller for the use of space facilities and services the judge who admits this basic point herndon reasons would be obliged to admit the buyer need not pay for what he doesnt get the tenant who received only part of his purchase could demand restitution either a pro rata reduction of his rent or permission to withhold rent until he gets all he bargained for one of herndons most successful tenant cases occurred not in san francisco but in californias fruitgrowing region he acted as counsel for a rent strike in tulare county where  migratoryworker families had struck to protest rent increases on dwellings they rented from the county the hikes werent  muchfrom  to but neither were the quarters by foot floorless corrugated sheds without facilities the federal government had given the camp to the county which had accumulated a  surplus on it the rent strike was six months old when the county sued to evict the families herndon based his defense on evidence that if tenants paid  for the sheds they would not be getting value received and also on a regulation which stated that raising rents required a new lease the judge quashed the eviction though leaning solely on the lease regulation in his opinion herndons insistence that any random day in court would bear out his appraisal of the judicial bias on tenancy led this reporter to drop by the san francisco small claims court one morning without checking the docket it was friday a light court day and in the court section i visited only one landlordtenant case was scheduled in the sunny golden oak courtroom quietly waited an uneasy commingling of the prosperous and the poor small claims courts were designed to permit those who cant afford lawyers to seek redress on small matters aggrieved persons may sue without counsel for judgments up to  in reality the poor rarely initiate cases the courts serve primarily as inexpensive collection machinery for merchants and landlords i listened to a succession of cases in which plaintiffs sought to collect owed bills and make good on bad checks but there was one customerinitiated case a comely matron successfully sued to recover for her unhappy purchase of a defective wig from her hairdresser then a bailiffs call brought before the judge a stylish blond an american indian and his slight wife who carried an infant and coaxed alongside three other small children the blond woman told the court that the family owed her a months rentthey had moved without giving the months notice or equivalent payment that california law says the tenant must m give the landlord before vacating they also owed for a broken window is this what happened the judge asked the couple in the informal manner of small claims proceedings yes the indian answered but we had reason he identified himself as an american seaman he said he had been flown home from the philippines for tuberculosis treatment to find his family without heat the bedroom ceiling leaking rain and the bathroom floor covered with water from a plumbing leak i moved the wife and kids onto dry land he said tersely the wife took up the thread in a weak voice she had repeatedly asked for repairs she said finally had called the health department a man had come out inspected and served the landlord an order to repair but no repairman came the children kept slipping down in the water and getting their clothes wet and the house was cold although brief the testimony touched on several points of law besides the requirement that tenants give a months notice both state and municipal statutes require the provision of heat and declare leaking roofs and leaking plumbing to constitute housing code violations then there is a court rule which theoretically permits tenants to move without obligation if the premises become uninhabitable the judges decision however was for the landlord the tenant was ordered to pay a months rent and the window assessment plus the court costs in higher courts the tenant finds himself even more handicapped herndon says in addition to judicial bias he and his neighborhood lawyer find themselves up against highlypaid council often a specialist in property cases these skilled men carefully plan their defenses to ward off court decisions unfavorable to landlordsdecisions that would set unwanted precedents it is against these affluent forces that herndon and his fellow crusaders have pitted themselves usually on a nonfee basis in the meantime until herndon and others persuade the courts to face modem tenant reality you may well find yourself in other positions even more uncomfortable 
the movement of black intellectuals toward total rejection of white control over the interpretation and evaluation of the forces and influences which shape black lives is inevitably sweeping some fellowtraveling black writers and leaders out of the way in the process it appears that ralph ellison surely one of the most gifted of american writers is rapidly losing his luster among black intellectuals even as he gains in glitter in the white establishment in a review of the book images of the negro in american literature published recently in freedomways ernest kaiser of the schomburg collection made the following very pertinent and perceptive assessment of the controversial mr ellison 
to ellison negro life in america is merely a part of the general human condition of western man to be mastered individually by each negro as a man he doesnt like the sociological description of the negroes struggles and suffering in the ghetto for he thinks that the sociological account reduces the negro and denies his humanity and cultural heritage but he is mistaken here the two go together they are not mutually exclusive at all following andre malraux the existentialists the disillusioned or clever opportunistic attackers of the left and the new critics who emphasize form as supreme even determining content ellison has become an establishment writer an uncle tom an attacker of the sociological formulations of the civil_rights movement a defender of the criminal vietnam war of extermination against the asian and american negro people a denigrator of the great tradition of negro protest writing and worst of all for himself as a creative artist a writer of weak and ineffectual fiction and essays mostly about himself and how he became an artist see the chapter from his forthcoming novel it always breaks out partisan review spring  several pieces in shadow and act  tell it like it is baby the nation september   and the interviews of him an american novelist who sometimes teaches n y times magazine nov   and a very stern discipline harpers march  and ironically enough ellison has developed in this way and reached these conclusions at the very time when the negro peoples liberation struggle has reached new heights when writers like john o killens the late lorraine hansberry langston hughes ronald l fair margaret walker william melvin kelley james baldwin paule marshall ossie davis loften mitchell lerone bennett jr john henrik clarke and other negro writers have delineated in novels short stories plays and trenchant essays the negro peoples aspirations and heroic struggles

the title of arna bontemps and jack conroys book anyplace but here hill and wang  is the punchline of a joke about some negro hoboes during the depression who flee a spot infested by a tough railroad detective the expression could equally well be attributed to the white denizens of cities to which negroes have migrated as the book is a record of the hardships and rejections negroes have suffered in their search for a better home anyplace but here is a reworking and a bringing up to date of they seek a city published in  chapters are added on the watts chicago and harlem riots bringing events up to  and the earlier chapters are rewritten parallel to the westward migration of the whites which negroes participated in as slaves scouts trappers cowboys cavalrymen and prospectors was the mass northward migration of negroes after the civil war the book tells of benjamin pap singleton who instigated the migration of negroes to kansas from the south after reconstruction singleton distributed circulars and chromos depicting prosperous conditions in kansas many negroes emigrated to kansas while others stopped in indiana and illinois or went farther west to colorado and california the book sketches the careers of many negroes of achievement among them jean baptiste point du sable founder of chicago jim beckwourth hunter trapper and scout william still a conductor in the underground railroad harriet tubman john jones prominent businessman and abolitionist of chicago the book documents the migration of negroes to chicago st louis detroit and new york during and after world war i and northward and westward after world war ii wherever negroes migrated they met opposition there were race riots in east st louis washington d c detroit chicago and other cities yet the negro has to assert his right to move and live freely wherever he desires even though it may involve living next to some very unpleasant neighbors by asserting his own rights he assures these rights to all i noticed two slight errors in the section about detroit which should be corrected in subsequent printings the street to which dr ossian sweet of the famous sweet case moved was not griswold but garland street griswold is a business street in downtown detroit belle isle park where the race riot of  began is not a park on belle isle belle isle park is belle isledudley randall keep the faith baby is a book of sermons by the rev adam clayton powell published by trident press at  the creativity of a clergyman is displayed in his sermon efforts the mark of authentic art is whether it clearly communicates the significant issues emerging from the contemporary scene unfortunately not many clergy have met this challenge however this is not the case with adam clayton powell this book of sermons spans his years as pastor of abyssinian baptist church they show that he is a watchman to his people in that he not only faithfully presents the hope of the christian faith but he does so by courageously couching this message within emerging issues of his time for this he is peculiarly well equipped since he is in the congress of this country he was aware of the world issues as they were emerging and to this information he creatively wove the significance of the hopes and aspirations of the black man in doing this he uniquely challenged the integrity of the united states as well as the courage of his constituents there is a timelessness about his sermons in that many of them speak to specific issues and yet they speak to the ongoing struggles of men everywhere for equality and justice he focuses the insights of the christian holy scriptures on the contemporary scene in the same way that an expert spotlight man does on the stage he believes that generalized preaching is nonbiblical and cites for his authority jesus who used specific parables as his main source of confrontation and teaching the upshot of this important work is that it symbolizes this inescapable fact which not enough people have realized that the saving element that can heal this society is the black man the black man for many reasons such as his perspective his sensitivity and circumstances is in the peculiar position to perform this important service for this culture as well as the world a quote from page  bears this out what can the negro do to develop this civilization anew unless the american blacks can supply something that the sweep of the white mans civilization has omitted there can be no future world certainly no better world this the negro cannot supply until he refuses to drink any more of the poisons of this civilization adam clayton powell in this book claims to be the author of the phrase black_power he tells what he means by the phrase first of all black_power is not antiwhite black_power incorporates everybody who wishes to work together vote together and worship together is black_power white supremacy in reverse black_power makes no moral judgment but white supremacy does black_power simply reaffirms the integrity dignity and selfrespect of black people white supremacy denies them if white people can accept black leadership    then i adam clayton powell welcome them this work provides an opportunity for many who have not observed the pastoral side of adam clayton powell to share his courageous and clear insights it is no wonder that many white clergymen now want to pastor black congregations for they realize that the true and challenging movements of god in our society are most clearly at work in the communities of the persecuted and

handyman of the lord is a biography written by james w english published by meredith press at  it is the biography of a fantastic atlanta clergyman named the rev william holmes borders this is the story of a sensitive and creative man unshakably committed to the liberation of his people he has rare gifts such as the ability to communicate effectively across racial lines and to enable our people to produce he could not be bought and was singleminded in his approach to his people he has a fantastic list of visible accomplishments such as he built a  housing project he started a churchsponsored credit union that has over  on deposit he operates an active job placement center and conducts a daycare nursery center for more than  children he participated vigorously in desegregation of atlanta public transportation restaurants and hotels he conducted programs for voter registration alcoholics anonymous and local school issues he conducts religious services for a congregation of  for the deaf and for prison inmates mr english though a white man deserves to be complimented in that he has observed the negro carefully and reproduced the feelings of black people rather significantly the rev mr borders has the kind of wisdom that we can all learn from and this book is a minimum tribute to such a significant lifejames e woodruff  jack olsen has written a book about cassius clay whom the world is begrudgingly beginning to recognize as muhammad ali black is best putnam  is based on a fivepart profile of the world heavyweight boxing champion written for sports illustrated of which the author is senior editor it is in comparison with the treatment generally accorded to its subject by the press a generous and objective picture of an entertaining serious and contradictory man although not an authorized biography and a distinctly unfriendly one as far as alis muslim beliefs are concerned the champion simultaneously withheld his approval and promoted the book in much the same way as he can taunt and goad his opponents and exhibit a tender solicitude for their healthafter the fight clearly ali is something unprecedented in the sporting life he has rejected most of the stereotyped activities associated with champion status for a negro fighterhe doesnt drink smoke or chase white women he is in his own eccentric way articulate and his own publicist he has no obvious vices but he is immodest about his own excellence and  is a muslim mr olsen is tolerant of the former but not the latter and undoubtedly feels that his muslim entourage increasingly removes him from reality and exploits his fame and his pocket with these prejudices which will certainly be shared by many of his readers mr olsen has nevertheless given us a reasonably full account of alis childhood of his parents and other relatives cassius clay sr might merit a book himself his coaches trainers and physicians and his brief marriage alis determination to be accessible to his people to the slum children who surround him in miami new york and chicago is a consistent and endearing factor among the many that make up his kaleidoscopic personality more attention indeed is devoted to alis personality than to his career as a fighter though an appendix lists opinions of various authorities fight promoters journalists other fighters of his standing in the ranks of championship holders he emerges as narcissistic ingenuous but shrewd mystical but practical given to wild flights of imagination and moments of sober truth but certainly neither charlatan nor fool brenda m biram i the race war the viking press  by ronald segal is a book that every american should read although white ronald segal has surveyed history from the perspective of a nonwhite his thesis is that the world is divided into two groups those who have and those who have not it is apparent that those with the economic advantage are white and those without it are nonwhite in its frenzy to keep its highly profitable economic advantage throughout the world the west has taken a stand against any and all revolutions that promise to liberate the poor from the oppression of poverty the united states leads the west in spreading and defending the democracy of privilege as a result the united states threatens to weld the forces of race and desperate poverty into one mr segals survey of history explodes many of our humanitarian and democratic myths often the united states has used these myths to justify its foreign policy and international involvements mr segal reveals the united states as something much less than the white knighthenceforth an expensive and dangerous deceit in about a hundred pages mr segal strides through  years of african history naturally much is omitted yet much more is said about subsahara history than is usually found in histories dealing with this oftenblack world the ancient kingdoms of kush ghana mali and songhai were not pocket kingdoms they covered vast areas included considerable populations and depended upon a complex administration yes africa has had a grand splendid history mr segals analysis of todays africa should be read by every western diplomat and molder of governmental policy he observes that the truth is that it is not neutralism or socialism that the west distrusts as much as independence mr segal sees south america as another continent ready to erupt into revolution he concludes that any country where the majority of the people are poor and starving is ripe for revolution and in south america the small ruling class is white the havenots are nonwhite in too many places in the world oppression and indifference to poverty and suffering have become identified with whites mr segals history of south america and his analysis of south americas present economic and social ills lead to the conclusion that the small ruling class in these countries to the south have already done much to unite the pain of poverty with color mr segals criticisms of the united states and russia find both countries guilty of racism and fated to be in opposition to future revolutions which may upset the existing racial and economic power structure regarding britain it is inconceivable that a nation that has spent over  years dominating colored people bouncing in and out of foreign lands and exacting tribute at whim would restrict the flow of colored people to her shores she has though and britains handling of southern rhodesia has not been lost on the african world russias treatment of african students studying within her boundaries has not endeared them to her explanations other than race have been given for this sometimes brutal treatment only time will tell whether this virulent madness has taken root in russia too the united states history of racism and brutality is carefully surveyed little needs to be said on this score we are familiar with the role our country has played and is still playing in the whiteblack showdown on the other hand china has several advantages over the west she is a colored nation she has risen and will continue to rise from backward circumstances similar to many emerging nations and she has been ruthlessly exploited by the west britain forced opium on china in  as a medium of trade china fought to preserve her dignity and integrity she lost the opium war she also lost the boxer rebellion at the beginning of the twentieth century as a consequence she was economically and territorially ravished by britain and the united states russia has been slow to respond to the need of the chinese communists she has given them little support china represents to the colored world a hope and a way to independence more importantly chinas victory over the west regardless of the area gives the colored nations a boost in morale for here is a colored nation giving the whites what so many feel is their just due again every american should read this book whether you accept mr segals premise does not matter you however will be brought face to face with vital issues which may decide your fate you will be exposed to these issues from a nonwhite perspective this point of view may be of crucial importance to all of us to your surprise you will find many feelings and suspicions raised to a conscious historical level that alone is enough to make this book worthwhileronald

organize its looserhythmed unrimed lines and plain vocabulary studded with the homely phrases of the negro characters hold the interest like a good short story in the section to live and die in dixie

hearing no protests  and seeing no pickets j yale university press v has published a paperback revised edition of robert a bones the negro novel in america now too late to prevent publication but perhaps in time to caution readers avidly seeking to learn about the artistic contributions of negroes it is necessary to point out the shortcomings the fallacies and the biases which vitiate mr bones commendable effort to evaluate negro writers novels according to literary criteria although i must become caustic i write with regret for such a book is needed and mr bone frequently demonstrates both the requisite critical acuteness and the literary talent to write perceptively and engagingly unfortunately not content to confine himself to the role of critic and historian of individual writers he has presumed to serve as psychiatrist philosopher and teacher not only for all negro writers but for all negroes forgetting his own admonition that extraordinary experience with another race is required of a writer who wishes to write perceptively of that race p  he has set forth a creed for the negro writer and intellectual and he has defended that creed by errors of fact and inference inconsistencies and contradictions supercilious lectures and flippant remarks often in bad taste
the characteristic weaknesses appear in the first two paragraphs of the introduction the advocates of naive brotherhood will object in advance to the notion of a negro novel they will deny usually without having read them that novels written by american negroes differ significantly from novels written by other americans   to this line of argument the classic rebuttal has been advanced by j saunders redding season it as you will he writes the thought that the negro american is different from other americans is still unpalatable to most negroes nevertheless he continues the negro is different an iron ring of historical circumstance has made him so as if to restore the balance he adds but the difference is of little depth with this balanced view i agree it is a serious mistake to gloss over or ignore strong cultural differences in order to speed the process of integration pp  bone covers an amazing amount of ground he intends to persuade the advocates of naive brotherhood that a negro novel exists first therefore his audience becomes indefinite i know what is meant by the phrase naive advocates of brotherhood but i do not know what is meant by naive brotherhood second bone seems determined to tilt with don quixotes giants few if any people question the fact that negro novels have been written the more critical issue is whether all novels written by american negroes differ significantly from novels written by other americans in such a way that a reader can determine the difference the impossibility of ever proving this statement is easily evidenced by the mistakes which have been made in identifying the racial origins of nonnegroes who have written about white people readers ignorant of the race of henrietta buckmaster or frank yerby do not instinctively recognize the truth but bone wanted to prove that there is a significant difference and in the age of madison avenue advertising he chose to prove it by testimony from one who should knowa negro writer bones misuse of saunders reddings words should provide teachers of freshman composition with at least one lecture on propaganda devices redding says that most negroes do not like to think that they are different from other americans but because of historical circumstances they have a difference which is of little depth to bone this proves strong cultural differences which produce a readily identifiable negro novel even this triumph is not enough for bone who jumps from a literary question not solved to a social question not asked as he advises the reader not to ignore the strong differences in order to speed the process of integration the literary critic has become the social teacher  these two paragraphs are a microcosm of the work the remainder of the introduction is similarly marred the dominant thesis is that as a minority group stripped denuded is bones word of its native culture the negro in america has been sundered in a psychic tugofwar between assimilationism and negro nationalism wishing to be white he has repulsed lowerclass members of his race while he has aped the mannerisms of middleclass white people cognizant that he is restricted within the dominant culture he has militantly marshaled his hatred against the white majority while he has aggrandized the minor successes of his own race assimilationism and negro nationalism concepts indispensable to understanding the cultural history of the american negro are employed throughout the    work not only in interpreting the consciousness of individual authors but in gauging the temper of whole periods    they provide  a fixed point of reference from which to view the changing attitudes of the negro novelistattitudes which are often fundamental to the content of his art p  this framework he says will provide analytical tools for studying the cultural history of the ethnic minority the american negro historians like benjamin quarles would argue that mr bones onesentence stripping of african culture from the american negro is a dubious oversimplification by failing to adopt a similar framework for analyzing the work of writers of the irish renaissance or jewish writers in america literary historians seem to distrust bones approach the major objection however is bones continuing to quote such respected writers as redding wright and ellison to verify conclusions which would be accepted without argument by a negro at least while he postulates as incontrovertible other theories which he has established by dexterous implication fallacious inference and wit for instance i would not dispute that if one wishes to simplify one may study the history of any minority groupfrom the hebrews in an egyptian society to the presentin terms of the attempt of that group to become part of or to rebel against the dominant culture but that fact does not justify the implication that a negro is hypocritical or assimilationistic if he likes beethovens music attends a staid episcopalian rather than a shouting baptist church and develops a patriarchal family structure p  the implication itself reveals the essential weakness in mr bones thought having a preconceived image of the negro and of the lives of negroes he defends those writers who support his image and attacks those who create contrary images although he admonishes scholars who attempt to base literary judgments on social bases p  too soon he lies in the pit against which he warned it is tempting but impossible in a paper of this length to refute mr bone point by point to call attention to all the errors of fact for many of which i would excuse him knowing the difficulty of dredging out some of the information to cite the many fallacious and inexcusable inferences and to note the instances in which the zest for turning a phrase has created a breach of good taste for the sake of illustration however i must discuss some of the more glaring the work is structured in six parts part i the novel of the rising middle class  part ii the discovery of the folk  part iii the search for a tradition   part iv the revolt against protest a postscript an essay on james baldwin which constitutes the only new material in the revised edition and an epilogue advice to negro writers parts iii and iv and the postscript have value as has the bibliography the book would be better if the other sections had not been written the poorest of the historiliterary sections is part i aggrieved by what he believes to be deplorable assimilationism by the negro middleclass and contemptuous of the popular literary traditions before  bone devotes considerable verbiage to an attack on both but principally the middleclass  he begins his attack with a spurious history of the rise of the middleclass the historical origins of the negro middleclass can be traced back to the nocturnal escapades of countless male aristocrats who tried valiantly to wash a race whiter than snow p  less offensive than the tasteless facetiousness is the amusing fact that despite his contempt for the negro writers who echoed the plantation tradition bone himself accepted one of the cardinal myths by implying that the south was populated only by aristocrats ignoring such darkskinned house servants as paul laurence dunbars mother he continues his myth by asserting that the house servants were mulatto children of the master who after the civil war naturally turned for assistance to the southern democrats who were their kin therefore they wrote novels addressed to their white folks reluctant to abandon the benefits of paternalism they still hoped to solve the problem of the color line within the family both branches p  since bone is vague about the identity of the early novelists it is difficult to refute him specifically one mentioned in the chapter however is charles w chesnutt who certainly did not believe that he was addressing his novels to his white kinfolk the middleclass next appears bone states under the guise of the talented tenth a term which is  the italics are bones  used synonymously with negro middleclass p  bones ambiguous phrasing makes it impossible to determine whether he is explaining that he wilfully uses it as a synonym or whether he mistakenly assumed that w e b du bois considered it a synonym needless to say du bois had too keen a sense of figures to have any difficulty distinguishing between the upper intellectual tenth of any group and the middle socioeconomic section of that same group for bone however talented tenth equals middleclass equals assimilationist bone reprimands this talented tenth group of early novelists one must assume that he includes all novelists before  for adopting the horatio alger success formula and for attempting to inculcate middleclass morality into their readers he concludes his reprimand with the dramatically irrelevant allegation that the early negro novelist had the soul of a shopkeeper p  a note reminiscent of some diatribes about the butcher boy of stratford this is not bones only grievance against the early novelists assuming that we are inclined to assume that this early protest literature    was based on a catholic concern for the brotherhood of man p an assumption never made by a negro literary historian he hastens to point out that the early novelists were prejudiced against jews immigrants and nonwhites p  even worse they sometimes betrayed their own race as when chesnutts protagonist protested his unwillingness to sit beside a group of negro farm hands here bone repeats the moral judgment uttered by liberals and by negroes themselves the negro should not be a snob any member of another group may despise the less talented less strong less intelligent less wealthy less healthy members of his group but the negro must love his fellowman worst of all bone continues the desire to assimilate caused the talented tenth to imitate outworn literary traditions of romanticism and melodrama rather than to recognize that american literature of the future would be that emulating the realism and naturalism and the styles of twain garland howells dreiser norris and james this is certainly the only instance in which a literary historian has found in social aspirations an explanation of the literary style of not one but an entire group of writers harassed by bones allegations and inconsistencies the early negro novelist has no chance for respectability if like chesnutt he realistically expressed the attitudes of negroes he is chastized for lacking a brotherly spirit if he wrote a horatio alger story he is derided as an assimilationist the obvious implication is that success stories should have been written only by white authors for white readers for the negro  should never have expected such success but that is exactly the attitude stated in one mans fortune by paul laurence dunbar whom bone denounces as an archassimilationist if the early novelist wrote in the melodramatic tradition of his time he is castigated for lacking the perceptivity missing equally from hundreds of nonnegro novelists who were writing the same kind of melodrama in the second chapter bone finally identifies the talented tenth novelists and a motley group they are whereas bone distinguished the writing of twain from that of howells and henry james he gathers into a single group the following diverse personalities paul laurence dunbar a provincial high school educated ohioborn and reared darkskinned youth who distrusted mulattoes and considered prose inferior to poetry charles waddell chesnutt a talented shortstory writer born in ohio but reared in north carolina sensitive to the problems of lightcolored negroes outspoken and determined to carve his fortune w e b du bois of massachusetts aristocratically proud of his ancestry educated as a scholar arrogant and militant a talented essayist who sometimes collected his essays as history and sometimes as novels and james weldon johnson cosmopolite from florida trained in education and in law attuned to the theatrical world of new york and to the diplomatic world of washington never has there been such a bundling under a single blanket since the bees flew in with aunt matilda to enforce the nonexistent unity bone digs out surprising similarities chesnutt and dunbar both wrote their first stories in the plantation tradition in the case of chesnutt this refers to the fact that his first published collection of tales focused on uncle julius a shrewd southern negro who to advance his own ends tells his northern employer tales based on the folk superstitions of negroes in north carolina unlike the typical stories of the plantation tradition they do not glorify the antebellum south as bone knew or should have known chesnutt once protested that he would not write about negroes contented with peonage under their exmasters even though he knew such negroes existed to identify chesnutt with the plantation tradition is therefore akin to describing guy de maupassant as a pastoral writer because he wrote about rural people furthermore bone asserts chesnutt and dunbar had white literary patronswalter hines page and william dean howells respectively the term patron insults all four men for it implies support far beyond that given or received page it is true was the  first editor to accept chesnutts stories but the decision to publish the first collection of chesnutts stories and his novels required authority which page lacked the relationship of howells to dunbar is even more tenuous howells introduced the poetry of dunbar to national attention by writing a favorable review of majors and minors and by writing an introduction to lyrics of lowly life if these acts define a patron then baudelaire was a patron of edgar allan poe actually dunbar unlike chesnutt did have white patrons but they were far less eminent than howells injudicious appraisals mar the attention which bone gives to these writers as individuals although he magnanimously contends that extenuating circumstances motivated dunbars uncle tom behavior he writes whenever dunbar had something to say which transcended the boundaries of the plantation tradition he resorted to the subterfuge of employing white characters rather than attempting a serious literary portrait of the negro p  obviously mr bone failed to read the strength of gideon and other stories bone sees in the relationship of bles and zora in the silver fleece  du boiss unconscious allegory of his attempt to embrace the negro masses an action which he can undertake only if zora re deems herself it is scarcely necessary to point out that in american novels of  one rarely finds heroes being wed to unredeemed or even to slightly stained heroines were all these writers revealing their unconscious antipathy for the masses or is such biographical symbolism to be exercised only in reading novels written by negroes bone describes du boiss diction as a schizophrenic clash of thcentury intellectual veneer against thcentury idiom p  du boiss new meanings strain against the old idiom but it will not yield when mark twain observed that james fenimore cooper wrote dialogue badly he explained that cooper wrote it badly because he did not listen to the way that people talk or did not have occasion to talk with characters of the type about whom he wrote but twain considered himself a judge of literature not a psychiatrist bones comments on james weldon johnson reveal his inconsistency andif i may be forgiven for adopting his critical approach reveal the subliminal tension between his aesthetic judgments and his social biases pleased with the artistic merits of the autobiography of an excoloured man and with johnsons defense of ragtime and the cakewalk bone treats lightly the fact that johnsons protagonist has higher aspirations the lowlife milieu of the harlem school is hardly his johnsons natural habitat p  a less competent novelist would have been condemned as assimilationist for implying that there are higher aspirations part iithe discussion of the renaissanceis markedly superior to the first but weakens eventually from bones stubborn effort to fit all the writings into the framework of assimilationism versus negro nationalism to indicate his approval of the talented rebels of the renaissance bone describes them as the intelligensia a term unfortunately more restrictive and less appropriate than talented tenth which he continues to use as a cudgel against the middleclass before he ends his introduction however bone dumps the intelligensia into the camp of harlem nationalists at war with the talented tenthmiddleclass advocates of the genteel tradition even in his discussion of the harlem school mr bones biases govern his aesthetic judgments he condemns the early novelists because they revealed their contempt for the masses by introducing in their works characters resembling those of the minstrel shows he praises the harlem writers for daring to create characters who run dangerously close to the stereotype p  and he continues to reveal unconsciously the limitations in his knowledge of negro life limitations which affect both his social theories and his interpretations of the works for instance he writes in the early negro novel a professor was a school teacher inflated achievement in the harlem school novel a professor is strictly the third party to a rickety piano and a precarious glass of beer p  but one familiar with idiom of the south knows that well into the forties fessuh was the generic title for all male teachers a novelist failing to use the term would have violated the idiom which bone wishes to protect it is difficult not to suspect that bone praises the harlem writers not merely because they are competent craftsmen but because despite occasional extravagances they more honestly reveal the negro as bone believes him to be bone for instance examines claude mckays characters as symbols whereas he derides the characters of the early novelists as counterstereotypes or minstrels his chief criticism of home to harlem and banjo is that ray mckays spokesman is too intellectual to permit mckay to renounce anglosaxon civilization as emphatically as bone expects he extols mckays achievement in banana bottom in which bita the protagonist marrying jubban embraces the beauty of peasant life  similarly although bone mentions the structural defects of langston hughes not without laughter his principal criticism is that by sending the protagonist back to school hughes contradicts his major themethat negroes cultivate the spirit of joy because achievement is largely illusory for them since bone finds no ambivalence or inconsistency in hughes attitudes towards racial matters in other works one wonders whether hughes did not say exactly what he desiredthat the negro must embrace joy and seek success perhaps it is merely bone who believes that one cannot exist in company with the other bones eloquent praise of jean toomer compensates for the fact that almost all of the biographical information is inexact toomers parents were not cultivated negroes of creole stock at least toomer never assumed that his georgiaborn father was the household tradition of tales of slavery exists factually only in bones imagination in fact toomer was eighteen before he became fully aware of the dramatic role which his grandfather p b s pinchback had played in the reconstruction toomer did not study law he did not turn to literature as quickly as bone implies but he did undertake a brief literary apprenticeship in cosmopolitan new york it is ironic that toomer whom he praises for having never underestimated the importance of his negro identity p  should have been the very one to proclaim loudest the statement which bone ridicules as the selfdeluding myth of the assimilationist i am not a negro i am an american on this issue of which he must have been aware bone is silent although bone cannot be blamed for wanting to discuss toomer cane is not a novel neither toomer nor the liveright publishers considered it such bones other errors in interpreting cane result merely from his excusable ignorance of the man and his other writings the errors however illustrate the danger of building a man a philosophy and a myth upon the subjective reading of one literary work in the final chapter of part ii the hapless middleclass become spokesman of negro philistia principally because of their attacks  on the harlem artists in this chapter more perhaps than in any other bone suffers a colorblindness which prevents his recognizing that du boiss objections to subject matter of novels and benjamin brawleys objections to jazz do not reflect racial posture but artistic standards it is difficult to draw a significant racial distinction between w d howells attack upon russian naturalistic novels and du boiss disgust with what he believed to be the filth of home to harlem similarly englishteacher brawleys criticism of the grammar of the lyrics of jazz is echoed today by many nonnegro critics of rock and roll but subconsciously believing that all worthy negroes should possess identical artistic standards bone flails them with arguments sometimes supported by misused quotations james weldon johnson whose instinct was always sound in such matters vigorously defended the lowerclass negro as higher literary material it takes nothing less than supreme genius he once remarked to make middleclass society black or white interestingto say nothing of making it dramatic p  johnson says nothing here about higher literary material whatever that may be he says that it is hard to write dramatically about middleclass people if he implies that it is therefore easier to write about lowerclass people he implies equally that it is easier to write about upperclass people such a blatant misuse of a source is as reprehensible as is the laudatory statement on the back cover of the negro novel in america which implies endorsement by the cla journal when in fact the quotation was taken from an article in the journal not even from a review suffering most in the chapter is jessie fauset who was never able to transcend the narrow limits of her sheltered background p  granted that miss fausets novels do not please surely the cause must be more than the kind of family background which edith wharton used advantageously miss fausets literary sin is not her failure to rebel against the kind of family which bone implies a negro ought not to have her sins are a diction which was outmoded by  and an inability to structure a plot effectively but bone ignores these artistic weaknesses to concern himself only with her family and her literary intentions even though he averred in the beginning that he would always establish the work of art in its own right before viewing it as part of the cultural process p  in part iii bone insists less on the struggle between assimilationism and nationalism it is just as well for some of the novelists he must discuss demonstrate a basic weakness of bones thesisit fails to consider that the writer by the very fact of his publishing is becoming a part of the dominant culture regardless of the thesis he expresses in his work in his private life arna bontemps surely must represent the middleclass negroes or the talented tenth who have adopted or have inherited the values identified with white middleclass americans of the protestant ethnic group and who by bones definition are assimilationist yet bontemps novel which bone praises most highly is black thunder which  bone believes is marred primarily by excessive race pride ie negro nationalism commendably bone calls attention to george henderson and william attaway whose novels should be better known while discussing these and richard wright he demonstrates that he has competence when he restricts himself to literary judgments zora neale hurston benefits from bones appraisal which points to the virtues of her work and minimizes her exploitation of the exotic in the speech and habits of negroes her caricaturing of negroes whose philosophies differed from hers her acceptance of the caste philosophy characteristic of the plantation tradition and her focus upon the atypical culture of eatonville florida as might be expected he judges harshly seraph on the suwanee which lacks the exotic charm of her earlier novels about negroes curiously he ignores moses man of the mountain which is perhaps miss hurstons most delightful work part iv challenged bone because for the first time he was forced to discuss a number of novelists who wrote nonnegro novels he met the challenge by dismissing frank yerby as the prince of pulpsters an allegation irrelevant to his thesis that novels by negroes must be significantly different and by defining as assimilationist such writers as richard wright chester himes zora neale hurston and ann petry when they wrote about white protagonists in parts iv and v he reveals his best work judging ellison and baldwin who lend themselves to mythic or symbolic interpretation he can propound explications which are provocative even if they do not always reflect the artists intentions near the conclusion of his book bone states the truth which should have dissuaded him from the thesis upon which he based literary as well as social judgments little remains to be said of these novelists as a group for like all real artists their work is highly individualistic p  having reached this understanding he can merely vacillate in the advice he offers negro novelists in a postscript the negro novelist should not sacrifice his art to the nonliterary attempt to correct social injustices let the negro novelist as citizen as political man vent his fury and indignation through the appropriate protest organizations but as novelist as artist let him pursue his vision his power of seeing and revealing which is mankinds rarest gift p  absorbed with the beauty of his phrases bone fails to observe that if mans rare gift makes him see injustice then artistic integrity requires him to reveal it this will be called protestif it is ineptly writtenfurthermore bone continues the negro writer should not seek to evade writing about the ghetto because if he does then it will lack an interpreter p  as soon as one judges art by adding the historical dimension bone states one realizes that the novelist is not free to deal with negro life when he does not write about the ghetto p  thus bone finally unmasks to reveal himself as one of those whom he cited richard gibson as castigatingthe professional liberal who reminds the negro writer that he cannot possibly know anything else but jim crow sharecropping slum ghettoes georgia crackers   p  bone concludes his advice with the reminder that although the negro novelist can write about anything he knows his early novel should be about negroes because most negro novelists will produce only one or two novels p  he knows this to be a fact because most negro novelists have produced only one or two novels in the beginning was mr bone s assertion of the need for a book which evaluated negro writers novels according to artistic standards if mr bone had limited himself to that task he would have succeeded despite his predilection for works lending themselves to mythic interpretation as a cultural historian or as a psychiatrist of the mentalities of millions of negroes however he is less than adequate	
today i saw an old t v man counting his steps several minutes passed before i realized that both of us were trying to cross the street and by that time a tall skinny lady in a chemise coat rushed up and grabbed his arm she talked to him for a moment he shook his head then she pulled him across the street holding up her hand to the approaching cars while he waved his faded red and white cane in a wide circular motion i followed keeping a measured distance behind when they reached the other side of the street she leaned over and whispered to him he nodded his head again and drooled on his faded gray jacket in an apparent attempt to smile she shook her head at me and another lady who had stopped to stare and then walked away with her head held ridiculously high he stood there for a moment tapping on the ground with his cane the way all old blind men with canes do acting as if they can send out morse code messages to the sidewalk to roll them to the places they want to go he stepped stopped stepped again and i saw that he was probably going to bump into the apartment building on the comer if someone didnt help him i stood there feeling stupid for watching and wondering why i was there at all another lady who happened to be passing by cautiously approached him asked a few questions and led him away looking at me with what i felt to be utter contempt i immediately felt ashamed on the way home i could not forget the mans face then i thought of simon for the first time in ten years simon always looked as if he had been dipped in grease and had then allowed some freestyle sculptorer to carve dirt into every line of his cinnamoncolored face and his patched beige suit his clothes hung from every limb and he resembled the pictures you sometimes see around halloween of masquerading skeletons at precisely six oclock every evening he would stop in front of my house head bowed body bent as if at any moment he expected numerous blows from behind a copper cup holding a pebble tied by a grime and grease smeared handkerchief to a faded red and white cane in one hand and a rustinfected cow bell in the other would literally ring me out of my chores to lead him home most of the time i arrived panting from what i laughingly called my fast getaway for although i expected him everyday at six i was always afraid that one day he would not make it during the two years he stopped at my house though i asked him many times he never told me how he got there and i never worried enough to find out here i am i would say and his cautious old hound would whine and lick my hand the old mans owlish eyes would roll around in their sockets in a useless attempt to focus on me i imagine we were an interesting looking couple a thin brown girl with legs and arms too long for anything except leaping and hugging with rulerlength hair the color and texture of a boar bristle brush  m        i      i i would lead him past dingy usedfurniture stores with cracked windows past oneroom churches where even at that time of day holy rollers were holding services and some lay twisting on the floor shouting while others hung out the doors praying for a breeze eyeing the parade of condemned nonchalant sinners outside past heat french names like la boutique and singed hair dresser shops with chateau coiffures where sweating hairdressers shared their space with americanstyled primebred fat and greasy rats and roaches that looked as if shampoo cremes and hair pomades were the healthiest diets in the world past maggotpacked restaurants with loud juke boxes which always seemed to be playing billie holiday records on and on until finally we would come to the alley where simon disappeared and i was sure he lived i never took him more than halfway into the garbagestaled urinedrenched alley i would watch him for a few minutes and then run out of that alley like a whipdriven horse leaving simon with the odors that invariably threatened my stomach the walk home was mine and  treasured it more than my first pair of high heel shoes and silk stockings  i thought of myself as an angel or undiscovered saint for at least ten minutes of the walk home i would remember how i had forced myself to walk slowly with simon instead of pulling him along behind me i could almost hear this or that neighbor saying isnt mattie a dignified child wearing pants all the time didnt count see how she takes time with old simon i wish my betty was more like her you never see mattie running after boys yelling and switching up the streets in fact you hardly see the sweet thing at all nellie wont have any trouble next year when the child goes to high school i would smile and think of how my mother would answer these comments well matties a perfect little lady now and has been since her twelfth birthday this june i told her then that when a girl makes that age she has to act different she has to stop talking so loud and popping gum and help me around the house more shes a little lazy but i dont have any real trouble with her thank the lord i didnt notice that i was acting any differently i never could pop gum or talk loud and i had always had to do housework since mama had worked for as long as i could remember nevertheless these thoughts would please me and almost push a nagging guilt out of my mind for whenever i saw simon for some reason or another i thought of mrs petrie mrs petrie lived next door and had arthritis her legs looked like swollen bowling pins and she never went anywhere she and her cigarsucking husband had lived in their stuffed musty apartment for as long as i could remember and she had always had arthritis he had always chewed or sucked an unlit halfsmoked cigar it could have been the same one for all i know because i never saw him smoking anyhow mother would make me go and sit with mrs petrie and read the bible and as soon as i was old enough to go to the store alone i had to run errands for her she was a kind woman and would always smooth my braids down they always stuck out at that time and tell me what a pretty thin face i had it was from mrs petrie that i learned how my full lips and large eyes would one day be my best assets i would sit quietly on her broken down hassock while she adjusted her glasses and she would either hum church hymns or talk in a broken creole dialect maddee you must neber poot dat powda on you smooth putti face i never tired of her talk her compliments were like my favorite chocolates almost too sweet to eat so that long after they had been digested the sweet flavor lagged behind to tease my mouth the family joke was how very much i ate and how skinny i grew working at digesting it as time passed however i grew restless because i always felt guilty and sometimes my manner with mrs petrie was painfully abrupt mrs petrie would send me to the grocery store every saturday and i would buy the petries food for the week after the first month i figured it out mr petrie never went past the comer and from there no grocery store was in sight in that household newspapers didnt exist mrs petrie certainly didnt know the cost of foods so i learned to cheat them first it was dimes later it was quarters and finally i managed to cheat them out of two and three dollars at a time of course they always paid me for shopping but somehow  cents never seemed like much for standing in saturday morning grocery lines fighting women with babies and shopping carts and badtempered food checkers i always felt guilty but i never felt guilty enough to stop extra money was unheard of in my house daddy barely made enough for necessities when i saw him and that wasnt often since he worked two jobs and slept when he was at home he never had any moneyor so he said mother was different she was thrifty she saved everything and it was useless to ask for anything other than that which could be proven to be needed but i managed and did so with a fair amount of ease i was smart enough not to splurge and buy anything expensive which could be used as evidence such as records books or puzzles these things i loved in those days i consumed a lot of sodas and malts miraculously my figure and skin never showed it mrs petrie always said that the williams girl must be the most wellmannered trustworthy child on the block and how she loved church i did not love church i could not go anywhere else when i was allowed outside to play i could not cross the street because mama said the children were too bad betty and joyce werent ladies and the boys pitched pennies i did not have a bicycle and definitely could not play hide and seek with the other girls and boys mother said that since i was lefthanded i owed the devil a days work and he was not going to collect it if she had anything to do with it so to church i went so i could get saved and cheat the devil out of his due on sundays i went to sunday school at  in the morning i doddled through  oclock service and evening vespers on tuesdays thursdays and fridays i went to the btu the btu was baptist training union for all young christians desirous of being saved mother said that rev metcalfe was sure to put plenty of holy things on my mind and she was partially right he put plenty on my mind he would pace in his pulpit roaring and stomping his feet calling for all sinners to come forth and repent although everyone at the btu except ancient church  stewards was sent by his parents and was truly desirous of being saved so he could die and go to heaven and lie in the arms of jesus and drink milk mixed with honey for ever and ever and yet every sunday evening at  rev metcalfe opened the doors of the church and proceeded to eloquently beg the sinners to come forth confess and repent you know who you are he would shout jesus knows who you are let not your hearts be troubled anymore let jesus take your burdens repent repent truly the lord knows your heart at precisely this point he always made the same speech the tears would begin to slide down my cheeks and i would feel like i was coming down with the flu or catching hay fever the steward who strutted back and forth in front of the congregation in her stiff nurses uniform thats what all the stewardesses wore head bobbed and bent arms folded shouting my my my everytime the preacher made a point would rush over and pat me on the shoulder and everyone except my mother and cousins would think i had been moved or touched by the spirit the stewardess whose name was bessie would assure me that the lord knew my heart and that would make me cry even more because that meant he knew i was thinking bad thoughts and feeling very guilty about mrs petrie now that i think about it my thoughts werent bad i did not always think about boys and when i did there was usually one in particular all i wanted to do was play hide and seek with the boys jump rope ride bicycles and cross the street to play with the bad kids but mrs petrie and simon were my playmates and now some ten years later i find myself feeling guilty about some old man i dont even know and thinking about simon and wondering what mrs petrie would say if she could see my short hair and still thin but powdered face my painted lips and short skirts   and wondering why when we moved to a new house and clean neighborhood the year i was  i never went back not even once to visit in the years that followed and wondering why i was wondering about any of it at all    what was wrong with me why had i stood there like that and foolishly watched the man struggle why hadnt i helped him but thousands of blind people lived in the world and for every one of them there were  people who could see and would help why should i have been the one let the other nine do it i never could understand why i could cross five main streets to lead simon home and cross two main streets to go and buy groceries for mrs petrie yet never cross one little street to play with those other children mother had said that that was different it was
she suddenly said no   knew that that was what she meant qji a   no what his voice already seemed further away quite distant why no dont come up but his voice was rising with that chafing that she had come to know perhaps too well im downstairs at the reception desk no she insisted as a matter of fact go home im going to bed youre not well he said im coming up youd better not coolly slipping out of the satin pumps that caused her considerable discomfort i might have you arrested for molesting me and she carefully replaced the receiver in its cradle expecting it to ring immediately afterward but when after three or four minutes it still had not rung she lifted the receiver waiting for the operator to respond alio oui the abrupt precise sound of the operators voice irritated her even more than an american counterparts for there was something pressing urgent in the little intake of breath terminating the salutation something insisted intimidatingly that all responses be in french well she wasnt having any she was through with her useful words and phrases shed used them all up id like to have a menu brought up please in very concise english but i can repeat the dinner menus to you madame if you like the voice assured her really quite cheerfully quite pleased and in excellent english in spite of a previous determination to be difficult she melted smiling oh would you the menus were repeated with added suggestion that the blanquette de veau was exceptionally good the voice had had it for dinner and it had been delicious recalling that blanquette de veau was one of the things shed learned to adore within a few scant days in france she ordered that along with a bottle of rose incidentally miss if anyone should call would you please say that i am not in i want to get to sleep as early as possible without being disturbed of course madame would that be all the voice retained throughout its pitch of impersonal though friendly concern and she was touched yes except i wonder if there  isnt a travel agency near the hotel the hotel can handle all travel arrangements for you if you wish    oh yes she remembered the thoughtfulness and service made one feel like staying and staying but she had made up her mind id like a reservation on the earliest possible flight to new york she said satisfied that now it was in motion it was being done by tomorrow night at the latest she would be home in her own little flat telephoning addie dishing all the dirt a voyage to paris had not been among her plans for the future so it seemed incongruous that she should find herself there now one day as it were she had taken a stroll down fifth avenue and suddenly found herself peering inquisitively through the window of the french national tourist bureau without hesitating she had entered got herself engaged in pleasant conversation with a charming woman and left the office nearly an hour later a little stack of convincing brochures clutched in a gloved hand then she had stopped in at doubledays and brought one of those useful words and phrases albums and gone straight home feeling that this indeed might be the year it occurred to her that she hadnt been saving all that money for a vacation that in some psychological improbable way it may have represented her hopes for the future a dowry the thought had occurred to her but shed shrugged it off certain that that had nothing to do with it men she had no real problems on that score although the fact remained she hadnt yet encountered the man not yet she didnt doubt that men found her interesting but she did not often find them interesting in return which led her to the suspicion that she might be too particular was she too particular she felt sure that she was not for she had had her moments unfortunately only one of them could be deemed truly brilliant and she could not recall much more of him than the pertinent fact he had surely not been the man had he been they might be together now here in this hotel this hotel that was smothering her with services she couldnt quite get used to someone tapped at the door and she stifled the feeble oui that issued up from her throat service a youthful deep rumble penetrated the heavy door which she opened a young waiter impeccably clad in crisp white jacket black bowtie and a generous smile wheeled a table laden with covered silver servingdishes into the room voulezvous mangez toute de suite madame oh ah    you speak english yes oh yes she said sorry that none of her useful words and phrases sprang to mind will you eat now or later the boy spoke in halting english but with an easy disarming cheerfulness busily setting a place at the little table beside the window thank you she flushed embarrassed by an inability to match the boys lack of constraint you are american yes the boy beamed yes then it is a pleasure to see you it is not often that we have a lady like you in the hotel like me     what was coming she tensed balancing on the balls of her feet ready to fly at the boys least insult yes noire but not noire oh we have had many groups from vafrique but it is not the same no you are more like our gentilles antiliaises antiliaises she settled back onto her heels i think you say in english west indian ladies yes oh yes eating her solitary dinner she thought about the boy who had been charming with a forthright simplicity that she had never known in the united states americans she thought a little defensively have a charm different and distinct the charm of jeanclaude for example could only be compared to that of other european men jeanclaude where was he having his dinner or was he having it at all perhaps in a rush of gallic defiance hed gone through that purported list of french girls less prudent than you american girls she had giggled inwardly then and giggled outwardly now the thought that french girls were less opposed than american girls to cold clammy hands that roamed uninvited seemed preposterous to her she hadnt been convinced and he hadnt come anywhere near the point what was it that could turn her definitively on there had been that night when after nearly two weeks of his wheedling she had said all right simply and straightforwardly she had agreed to go take a nitecap at his apartment but it had been the ensuing leer of triumph skittering across his almost too handsome face that signaled a final no nevertheless she had gone up because shed already said yes a completely negligible move as far as she was concerned for she was certain that nothing would come of it and nothing had coming across on the boat she had had a very brief enlightening introduction to european gallantry men had pursued her just as openly as they pursued other unattached girls aboard and it had been mildly amusing then in paris she had encountered jeanclaude who appeared still less concerned with the color of her skin in fact for the briefest moment before doubt began to nudge her naturally wary innerself the idea that here was a man a white man regarding her as just another pretty very eligible girl appealed to her for the briefest moment she suspected that maybe this may be indeed the year and if it turned out to be then how nice to break clear from all that unpleasantness at home she wasnt however bowled over by jeanclaude gallant and attentive in a way totally unfamiliar to her their goodnights at the door of her hotel were never atingle she was never sure whether his approach was truly subtle or just clumsy with that nervous expectancy once aroused in her by say harry jones the harry jones who although long gone into that dim corner of things past had made an unforgettable bid for immortality in her book of things not easily forgotten jeanclaude had taken her to dine in places she sensed to be select and he had shown her to people to whom he waved but who seldom ventured as near as their table when they did it was to address him in rapidfire french that sounded fine and foreign to her cars interspersed as it often was with rich laughter strolling the grands boulevards or in the bois people often stared after or directly at them at such times she would have given an arm or a leg to know just what they were seeing were they seeing a handsome young couple or just a colored girl being misled by a wily frenchman worse did they imagine that here was another baudelaire french unfortunate victimized by an inclination toward vice and the will of an unscrupulous colored girl in any event she rarely pursued it very deeply for she found the entire process terribly unpleasant furthermore she was surprised to discover that it didnt really make much difference to her what they were seeing what they thought jeanclaudes thoughts which he managed extremely well to keep to himself interested her infinitely morethe first time he kissed her well there youve been caught kissing a white man can you get lynched for it flashed through her thoughts and hers was an insensate desire to laugh intended in the spirit of a liberal sense of humor which she did possess she didnt find this particular thought however very funny for definitely in the category sloppy kiss of a nature too inquisitive not commensurate with so brief a relationship it surely would not have been worth getting lynched for having dared she pushed him rather brusquely away whats the matter have i presumed too much his voice already hoarse with anticipation vibrated less chagrin than worry that his technique may have been ineffective and once more she felt an insensate desire to laugh because it occurred to her that the kiss may have been more successful had it been possible for him to embrace himself no she managed to whisper its just that i wouldnt want to be seen    like that  in the street in the street he was incredulous what difference pulling her toward him this is paris and you mustnt concern yourself with trivialities yes she said wondering how this illusion that paris was so different exempt from simple modesty had permeated the skins of so many thousands convinced them that here more than anywhere else in the world anything was possible nothing mattered she deftly parrying his subsequent attempts at seduction soon escaped into the hotel and up to the calm of her room a definite decision was in order she realized but couldnt bear the prospect of another of those kisses the following night she refused an invitation to accompany him to his flat for a nitecap pouring herself another glass of wine now she finished the remainder of the strawberries then lit a cigarette poor jeanclaude its not that im hard to get im just not easily had like most girls how angry he had been when at last she had relented accompanied him to his flat only to explain to him the impossibility of it all flustered impatient to be on with it he had after a few preliminary kisses begun to explore and tug at the complexities of the various fastenings of her suit she sprang to her feet rearranging her somewhat troubled hair look dear boy a few kisses dont give you free title to the place she said managing a thin smile necessary counter to the anger welling up inside her what jeanclaude scrambled to his feet not having understood and making no effort to conceal what she considered a lack of selfcontrol and therefore a lack of respect for her i mean ive kissed you because i was willing to do it but it doesnt give you the right to undress me the words tumbling from her lips stung how could she explain that there were ways of doing it ways of arriving at that pointofnoreturn how could she explain that it was useless now that he was just a clumsy impatient bear of a man a child no his entire demeanor expressed an innate willingness to knock her down possibly tear away her clothing and achieve his aims in a primitive fashion because it was what he wanted a really primitive affair well no jeanclaude and that goes for all the rest of the apes like you he drove her back to her hotel in a rage of petulant silence during which she merely stared not the least bit wistfully out the window she watched the street feeling a source of history vibrating from the building facades sensing that much of that history had been implement in the formation of the history of her own country her own country there was the thrill she became warm at the thought of a place of her own to return to her own flat in new york city feeling warm and good inside she was already moving toward home turning out the light she crept in between the cool sheets grateful for their caressing smoothness and her last thoughts before drifting off to sleep were oh goodbye jeanclaude i wonder whats on sale at bloomingdales
the utrillo print on the    £ wall was the same as  ii £ any other utrillo print a street with leafless trees people and buildings but there were other pictures too and there was a carpet on the floor and elegant chairs to be used by elegant people nina wasnt so elegant there werent many people only four other girls they didnt look as if they just happened to be lucky enough to run off their jobs for a visit to an optometrist they looked as if they could command someone to call the doctor and dictate when they could visit his office the doctor himself was very tall and rather pale but his hair was a golden glowing red also he was a proud walker one could easily understand that from the way his shoulders were upright and drawn back in an almost militaristic manner he was a youngish older man he came out to his reception room to tell his first patient goodbye and he glanced about the room and down at a dark green book he looked up quizzically and politely miss gallagher youre next the girl rose and followed him gratefully it was  nina wondered whenor ifher turn would be she thought she should tell him that her appointment had been made over a week ago but then how could she when he hadnt seemed even to notice that she was there when he entered the room perhaps she should not have taken alberts advice perhaps she should have gone to the negro eye doctor the way she had wanted to do but albert had said no that that guy couldnt fix eyes any better than he could and that she would be just wasting her hardearned money and her time you want a doctor he told her go to a doctor not some jackleg of a medicine man who dont know what hes doing and goin overcharge too since she was living with cousin albert and his family she thought she should do what he said out of respect for him rather than for what he thought now this white man was coming out to his fine reception room and not even really paying attention to his little green book if he had he  would have seen that she was listed there for thursday noon she hadnt been in new jersey long but she could see that the people were different down home at dr johnsons office there were always a lot of people and sometimes he would rush in and say ill get to you next mrs so and so be patient with me and you didnt mind waiting well you minded but you waited because you knew that doctor was really pressed for time like colored folks get and doing the best he could besides he was a colored man and you were proud that he was a doctor and had his office in your neighborhood although he didnt live there but yet and still you realized he must have had a hard time getting to be a doctor and so you waited at  pm the doctor came for another patient he smiled warmly and said sorry i made you wait he was a charming man his eyes were very blue the girl smiled back she was the last white woman nina was the only other patient left nina thought he might decide to close his office and tell her to come back tomorrow like the ones of his kind down home yes he might just decide to close his office she gathered her purse and stood up to go she was angry surely he had written down her name the day she called but he hadnt even seen her she just couldnt understand white folks she didnt like being last either not when she felt that she had called earlier in the week she sat down again no ill stay and i will tell that cracker exactly what i think i had no business coming here this money shouldve gone to a negro doctor anyway these people have enough money already albert hasnt got any race pride or he wouldve seen to it that l had a negro doctor he knew good and well i just got up here but then the doctor was passing by her and opening the door for his patient and he turned toward her youre missjust a second he jerked up the book miss willis come in just sit here she sat down she thought he looked most peculiar as if he were not long awakened he asked a lot of questions now he said i want you to tell me if the red spot you see is moving right left or up and down do you see it yes ok she answered his questions hoping that the examination would not last much longer ever wore glasses before no what type of work do you do factory i work in a mica factory what a mica factory i cut the discs for little television parts its very thin stuff like glass but its not really glass its like plastic i guess do you think some got into your eyes i dont know but they hurt do you read a lot not too much why was he looking at her like that white people up north were most peculiar he said excuse me and left the room now hes making me wait again ive got to get out of here glasses or no glasses the green book was open miss willis  she read so she was right her name was number two on his list and he an eye doctor should fix his own eyes here he said wash your eyes  no just look up he held the dropper and a stinging mist fell into her eyes doctor im in a hurry why arent your eyes the most important thing yes but i have to get back to my job you have beautiful eyeslike that really lovely he leaned very close to her ive got to go but when she moved from the chair he caught her and held her to himself then he was embracing her then kissing her he didnt seem to hear her say stop and so she said stop white man his body became rigidfor only a secondand then he kissed her again love he said but it wasnt actually the word he used is the supreme equalizer the supreme equalizer let me go let me go no when i saw you come in i knew i knew in your eyes micas in my eyes you do believe that love this time he said loveis the supreme equalizer dont you why dont you believe black white they dont matter love brings you to my level love and he said a lot of things in the same vein his red hair rumpled and his suit completely disheveled his eyes were very wild and he seemed much too red and very exhausted as if he might fall over or something ive got to get out of here nina was thinking if this white man should die they would put the blame on me they would surely put the blame on me she straightened her clothes and fixed her hair watching the man he was composed now and he wore the white seemingnottosee look just as he had worn it earlier as she sat in the waiting room his eyes were cold blue again but there was still the slightest bit of warmth in them quickly nina turned to leave the doctor was sitting in the chair where she had sat and he was looking at her she was drawn toward him but then she ran out the door still she could hear his warm gentle voice saying just remember love is the supreme equalizer nina was a great distance from the elegant office before she could think about her job or about cousin albert oh lord she panicked what will i tell that fool cousin of mine and then she said to herself white folks are the same everywhere they all think that theres at least one thing a black person got to do to be equal to them theres always at least one little thing 
for historian lerone bennett jr one of the beautiful experiences at the core convention in california was listening to ambassador michael lukumbuzya of tanzania the ambassador is unique in many ways to begin with he is dazzlingly eloquent without exhibiting any of the arrogance which usually accompanies such eloquence then he has no apparent problems of status which is one of the handicaps which befall many highranking africans when it comes to communicating with afroamericans and best of all the ambassador sees the complexities of power in the world as clearly as he speaks ambassador lukumbuzya is a spokesman for his countrys political position which is considerably to the left of where most of the western powers would like it to be like his president julius nyerere he has no illusions about making it in a world where the big powers swallow the little underdeveloped countries almost at will on the other hand he has no intention of selling the people of tanzania tanganyika and zanzibar down the hatch in the name of interdependency and cooperative development at the second conversations with africa conference sponsored by the phelpsstokes fund at capahosic virginia last spring see the july negro digest ambassador lukumbuzya had the occasion to state his countrys position with great emphasis he was advised by a smooth afroamerican an employee of some years with the state department that interdependency seemed the best way of bringing such underdeveloped countries as tanzania into the modern world the government man was joined by a distinguished afroamerican jurist who suggested that afroamerican dollars invested in black africa was a means of providing muchneeded capital without raising his voice above its customary level of quiet emphasis the ambassador attacked he described how interdependency worked in black africa by citing an example in his own country a mineral exploiting firm had been invited into the country to establish a mining complex the assumption being that the industry would result in new jobs satellite industries and a viable new community what actually happened was that the exploiters came in ravaged the earth of its valuable minerals provided no homes or technological work or training for the local citizens and then departed the area leaving exhausted mines and general despair however the mineral wealth was taken out of africa the ambassador made it quite clear that tanzania would have no more of that he also made it clear that afroamericans were welcome in tanzaniabut only if they came to help that is only if they came to tanzania willing to join with the people there live with them share with them and grow with them afroamericans are no more welcome to come into tanzania as exploiters than any other americansor europeansand especially since so many afroamericans these days are roaming the nonwhite world as agents of the same old white masters what is so wonderful about ambassador lukumbuzya apart from his views is the fact that he takes the time to meet with and to communicate with his black brothers in america this cannot endear him with the power interests in this country but it makes him beautifully black 
frederick campbell is a painter with the keen insight of a sociologist but with an essential difference he has a deep love and appreciation for the objects of his painters eye and his affection shows in the strokes of his brush which capture illuminating moments and emotions in the faces and gestures of his subjects the artists memory is long in the april  issue of ebony magazine a startlingly graphic picture was published showing a woman reclining voluptuously on a bed while her husband sat on the beds edge the photograph was one of a number used to illustrate the plight of black southern migrants who had moved to california to find work as cotton pickers and had found racism and unemployment instead more than a decade later mr campbell remembered that womans pose in his painting the hustler which projects an entirely different context from the california scene and where pickers way after he finds inspiration the painting the  evolved in the everycotton following a book calledreading drum i wanted to paint a picture of the type of negro i thought was depicted in the book mr campbell said one thing led to another so i began thinking that the reason we dont all look alike is among other things because we came from different types of black people to begin with now the plot thickens i added to my idea a woman knowing of at least two different types imported to this countryone of the true negroid type coming from the baluba or bacuba tribes the man and two coming from the mangbetu tribes which are almost mongoloid in appearance the woman now having gotten this fixed  needed a composition so i thought a straightforward approach would be best when this was done i thought of how much it reminded me of the grant wood painting american gothic so i wanted to add something of underlying meaning and feeling to my people i put a faint smile of diplomatic temporary submission on the mans lips but with hidden defiance showing in his eyes the woman is showing withdrawn but stubborn defiance which could be mistaken as a squint because of the sun the background shows the bareness our people found in the new land that was forced on them mr campbell is a native philadelphian and a former student at the hussian school of art last spring a major exhibition of his paintings and drawings was presented at the hampton institute college museum by curator dr richard a long
